*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy is an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant that enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning to handle diverse mobile app interfaces and evolving user needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large multi-modal models struggle with real-world mobile GUI scenarios involving diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction act unilaterally, harming user experience.

Method: Fairy uses three core modules: (i) Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks into sub-tasks from cross-app view; (ii) App-Level Executor that refines sub-tasks into steps and actions using long- and short-term memory, with four core agents operating in dual loops for precise execution and user interaction; (iii) Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience into App Map and Tricks.

Result: Fairy with GPT-4o backbone outperforms previous state-of-the-art by improving user requirement completion by 33.7% and reducing redundant steps by 58.5% on the RealMobile-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: Fairy demonstrates effectiveness through its interaction and self-learning capabilities, showing significant improvements in handling real-world mobile GUI scenarios.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [2] [ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21134)
*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToMPO algorithm enhances LLM strategic decision-making by reasoning about others' strategies, estimating multi-level advantages, and balancing rewards, outperforming GRPO by 35% and larger models by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM decision-making studies focus on social conversations or simulations, neglecting strategic decision types and interdependencies. Current RL methods fail to consider others' strategies during training.

Method: Proposed ToMPO algorithm with: 1) strategy-based rollouts, 2) graph-level and sample-level advantage estimation, 3) global and partial reward balancing.

Result: ToMPO outperforms GRPO by 35% in output compliance and cooperative outcomes, and shows 18% improvement over models 100x larger.

Conclusion: ToMPO effectively enhances LLM strategic decision-making capabilities through improved strategy reasoning and multi-level optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

### [3] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent behavior that detects errors by analyzing sequences of agent actions rather than text outputs, enabling systematic verification of LLM-based agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-detection methods rely on fragile text matching of inputs/outputs, which fails due to natural language variability in LLM responses. There's a need for more robust monitoring of agent behavior patterns.

Method: Uses temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions. Creates assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios.

Result: Successfully detected behavioral anomalies when smaller models were substituted, flagging improper tool sequencing and failed coordination handoffs. All temporal assertions were satisfied with capable models.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability in production systems, enabling validation of prompt engineering and regression testing when agents are updated.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [4] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS is a method that adaptively allocates computation during LLM generation by using a verifier model to decide when to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop based on local difficulty, achieving better accuracy-compute tradeoffs than uniform test-time scaling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps without considering instance complexity, leading to inefficient resource use.

Method: LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion at each generation step to dynamically decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop, adjusting computational effort based on local difficulty.

Result: Empirical results show LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy-compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive computation allocation based on local difficulty through verifier-based decision making provides more efficient test-time scaling for LLMs.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM tools often produce verbose summaries that replace rather than assist reading, creating a need for tools that guide researchers through scientific literature without replacing the reading process.

Method: Embedded an expert's reading methodology into AI logic, using prompt-driven methodology to provide concise, structured insights that act as a 'map' to key paper elements.

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE successfully functions as a reading assistant that provides structured guidance, addressing the challenge of scientific literature proliferation while preserving the value of reading source material.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [7] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction framework for adaptive scheduling in time-triggered systems that dynamically validates and assembles schedules from AI-generated priorities while ensuring safety constraints and handling unexpected events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in time-triggered systems including message collisions, locked loops from incorrect precedence handling, and generation of incomplete/invalid schedules that compromise system safety and performance.

Method: Systematic transformation of AI-generated or heuristic scheduling priorities into executable schedules with robust safety checks, efficient allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms for hardware failures and mode transitions.

Result: Significantly enhances system adaptability, operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational efficiency across makespan minimization, workload balancing, and energy efficiency profiles.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for safe schedule generation in safety-critical time-triggered systems, enabling reliable and flexible real-time scheduling under dynamic and uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [8] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive online learning unit using Reinforcement Learning to overcome limitations of offline training for AI scheduling inferences in time-triggered architectures, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline training for AI scheduling inferences faces challenges in constructing comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graphs that account for all possible scenarios, especially complex context events like hardware failures and mode changes, which is resource-intensive and often infeasible.

Method: Integration of an adaptive online learning unit within the metascheduler using Reinforcement Learning models that continuously explore and discover new scheduling solutions, expanding the Multi-Schedule Graph and optimizing existing schedulers in real-time.

Result: The system can handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively, continuously refining AI inferences through real-time training to meet evolving demands and stricter performance criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed approach ensures robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments by maintaining system flexibility and capability through dynamic adaptation to changing conditions.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [9] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy recognition system for EMG-based hand prosthesis control that detects contaminated biosignals using one-class classifiers and KNN ensembles to improve classification quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMG biosignals for prosthesis control are highly susceptible to contamination, which significantly reduces classification quality and makes pattern recognition unreliable.

Method: Two-stage system: (1) One-class classifier ensemble to detect contaminated biosignal channels, (2) K-nearest neighbors ensemble for intent recognition, both using a unified fuzzy model for soft decision-making.

Result: Experimental evaluation using real biosignals showed the system can effectively detect contamination and improve recognition quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy recognition system with contamination detection successfully mitigates adverse effects of biosignal contamination, enhancing reliability of EMG-based prosthesis control.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

### [10] [SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20562)
*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE is a self-learning agent framework that uses multi-level reflection synthesis (micro, meso, macro) to train a retrospective language model for generating meaningful reflections, significantly outperforming existing reflection-based approaches on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes SAMULE framework with Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) for error taxonomies across multiple trials; Inter-Task Learning (macro-level) for transferable insights from diverse task failures. Fine-tunes a retrospective language model and extends to interactive settings with foresight-based reflection.

Result: Extensive experiments on TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench show significant performance improvements over reflection-based baselines.

Conclusion: Well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are critical for building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed a RAG system using LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware radiotherapy plan evaluation with interpretable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated system for radiotherapy treatment plan evaluation that is protocol-aware, interpretable, and minimizes hallucination while providing traceable outputs.

Method: Used a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites. Built a RAG system with three core modules: retrieval engine (optimized with five SentenceTransformer backbones), percentile prediction based on cohort similarity, and clinical constraint checker, directed by LLM using multi-step prompt-driven reasoning.

Result: Achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within 5-percentile-point margin and sub-2pt MAE with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 backbone. End-to-end testing showed 100% agreement with standalone modules for percentile estimates and constraint identification.

Conclusion: Combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning is feasible for transparent, scalable radiotherapy plan evaluation. System offers traceable outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

### [14] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining non-autoregressive (NAR) and autoregressive (AR) models for reasoning tasks, where NAR generates intermediate reasoning traces efficiently and AR produces precise final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models are slow for reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought, while NAR models are fast but produce lower quality outputs. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Use NAR models (like discrete diffusion) to generate intermediate reasoning traces in parallel, then use AR models guided by these traces to produce final answers.

Result: 26% improvement over strong baselines with substantially reduced inference cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid NAR-AR framework effectively balances speed and quality for reasoning tasks, achieving significant performance gains while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Motivation: Robots need effective memory storage and retrieval mechanisms to handle complex environments and answer human queries about spatial locations, which remains an underexplored research challenge.

Method: Proposes Meta-Memory, an LLM-driven agent that creates high-density memory representations and retrieves/integrates relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries.

Result: Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA dataset and public NaVQA benchmarks, and was successfully deployed on real-world robotic platforms.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory empowers robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities, demonstrating practical utility in complex environments through its joint semantic-spatial reasoning approach.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

### [16] [LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Log Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20798)
*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner is a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework that improves LLMs' log analysis capabilities by structuring expert thinking workflows and refining reasoning details through fine-tuning and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with structured reasoning workflows and precise reasoning steps for log analysis tasks, failing to align with expert cognition patterns needed for effective system monitoring and failure diagnosis.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) coarse-grained enhancement using expert troubleshooting flowcharts to structure reasoning workflows, and (2) fine-grained enhancement through task-specific fine-tuning and preference learning to calibrate reasoning details from mistakes.

Result: LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs on four log analysis tasks using Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance in enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables LLMs to reason about log analysis tasks like experts by combining structured workflow formulation with detailed reasoning refinement.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

### [17] [DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20912)
*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto is a counterfactual reasoning framework that improves multimodal language models by enforcing both accurate answering and faithful reasoning through three training paradigms: positive, counterfactual, and random-masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models often arrive at correct answers using irrelevant image regions due to prior knowledge or dataset biases, indicating flawed reasoning and lack of true image understanding.

Method: Uses three complementary training paradigms with automatically generated positive, counterfactual, and random-masking variants. Trains models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning using three complementary rewards to guide accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.

Result: Experiments show DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across diverse benchmarks, establishing stronger interpretable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: DeFacto provides an effective framework for enhancing reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks, with code available on GitHub and dataset released on HuggingFace.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

### [18] [GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20935)
*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX integrates GNNs into LLMs via reinforcement learning with a Graph Process Reward Model to generate disease-relevant subgraphs, addressing limitations in existing methods for precision medicine target discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines in precision medicine have limitations: numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics. Process Reward Models face issues with unreliable intermediate evaluation and reward hacking.

Method: Proposed GALAX framework integrates pretrained GNNs into LLMs via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM). It generates disease-relevant subgraphs step-wise initiated by LLM and iteratively evaluated by GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate annotations.

Result: Introduced Target-QA benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across cancer cell lines. This enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs.

Conclusion: GALAX provides a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based framework for mobile app review analysis that addresses limitations of star ratings by extracting nuanced feedback from text reviews using structured prompting and RAG-QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional star-rating systems fail to capture nuanced feedback in detailed review texts, and conventional NLP methods struggle with contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and linguistic features like sarcasm.

Method: A modular framework using large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques, which quantifies rating-text discrepancies, extracts feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three datasets (AWARE, Google Play, Spotify) show the LLM-driven approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging review scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based framework effectively overcomes limitations of traditional review analysis methods, providing superior performance in extracting nuanced feedback and supporting interactive exploration of mobile app reviews.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

*Xiaozhuang Song,Xuanhao Pan,Xinjian Zhao,Hangting Ye,Shufei Zhang,Jian Tang,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT* is a framework that combines LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search to improve retrosynthesis planning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step retrosynthetic planning faces computational challenges due to exponential search spaces and high inference costs, while existing LLM approaches have efficiency and cost constraints.

Method: AOT* integrates LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search, using atomic mapping of synthesis routes onto tree components with reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering.

Result: AOT* achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved search efficiency, requiring 3-5× fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, especially on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: The AOT* framework successfully transforms retrosynthetic planning by efficiently navigating chemical space using LLMs combined with systematic tree search, demonstrating superior efficiency and competitive performance.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

TL;DR: Proposes a DFA-based framework and CORE metrics suite to evaluate AI agents' function-call sequences beyond binary final-state assessment, measuring safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks only evaluate final outcomes, ignoring critical aspects like safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness in function-call sequences.

Method: Uses deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to encode tasks as valid tool-use paths, and introduces CORE metrics (Path Correctness, Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, Efficiency).

Result: The framework reveals performance differences between agents that appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation across diverse world models.

Conclusion: The proposed DFA-based framework and CORE metrics provide principled assessment of agent behavior, capturing important performance aspects missed by traditional evaluation methods.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a new QA benchmark using scientific articles to test LLMs' long-context reasoning, featuring complex questions requiring information synthesis across multiple papers, with verifiable SQL-based reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context benchmarks use non-scientific texts, focus on simple retrieval, or employ artificial contexts, failing to evaluate complex reasoning across real scientific literature.

Method: Automatically generate questions and answers by formulating them as SQL queries over a database of article metadata, providing explicit reasoning steps and scaling to 1M token contexts with minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments show SciTrek poses significant challenges as context length increases, with limited gains from fine-tuning and RL. Models struggle with basic numerical operations and locating specific information in long contexts.

Conclusion: SciTrek reveals systematic shortcomings in LLMs' long-context reasoning abilities and provides a scalable benchmark for evaluating complex information synthesis across scientific literature.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that treats knowledge graph context construction as a sequential decision process, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and cost through multi-agent coordination under user-specified budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime, failing to balance accuracy with deployment constraints like latency and cost.

Method: Uses three-agent neuro-symbolic framework with LC-MAPPO algorithm to coordinate Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator agents for joint optimization of subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under resource budgets.

Result: Achieves higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop: +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG.

Conclusion: CLAUSE produces compact, provenance-preserving contexts with predictable performance under deployment constraints, enabling per-query adaptation to accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs without retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for evaluating AI creativity in scientific idea generation, discovering scaling behaviors, optimal model architectures, and a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that limits LLMs' creative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks don't address AI's creative generalization abilities, particularly for open-ended tasks like scientific idea generation where traditional accuracy metrics are inadequate.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework and algorithmic task that evaluates outputs based on novelty and utility rather than correctness, then conducted empirical studies on LLM scaling behavior and architecture optimization.

Result: Found optimal model depths/widths for creativity, identified an ideation-execution gap where LLMs generate novel ideas but struggle with feasibility, and discovered a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that remains even at scale.

Conclusion: The persistent novelty-utility tradeoff casts doubt on LLMs' long-term creative potential in current form, providing foundational insights for understanding and improving AI creativity as a new frontier in generalization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

*Haodong Zhao,Jidong Li,Zhaomin Wu,Tianjie Ju,Zhuosheng Zhang,Bingsheng He,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasive efficacy in Multi-Agent Systems depends on model scale, proposing instead that persuasion dynamics are governed by a model's cognitive process and reasoning capacity. The research reveals a 'Persuasion Duality' where reasoning models resist persuasion but become highly persuasive when their reasoning is transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing belief that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments to examine persuasion dynamics, including analyzing resistance to persuasion and the effects of making reasoning processes transparent through sharing 'thinking content'. Also studied complex transmission persuasion situations in multi-hop persuasion networks.

Result: Found that LRMs with reasoning processes exhibit significantly greater resistance to persuasion, maintaining initial beliefs more robustly. However, making reasoning transparent dramatically increases their persuasive ability. Complex dynamics of influence propagation and decay were revealed in multi-hop persuasion networks.

Conclusion: The research provides systematic evidence linking a model's internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering a novel explanation for susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting critical implications for safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act is a self-evolving multi-agent framework that improves web task execution through a reconnaissance-action paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena by dynamically generating and using generalized tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with disordered action sequencing and excessive trial-and-error when solving multi-turn, long-horizon tasks on real-world webpages, limiting their effectiveness in practical browser automation scenarios.

Method: A two-team framework: Reconnaissance Team conducts comparative analysis of successful vs. erroneous trajectories to generate remedies as generalized tools (hints or rule-based codes), while Action Team handles intent decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution using these tools in a closed-loop training pipeline.

Result: Recon-Act achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena, substantially improves adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and has reached Level 3 implementation with limited human intervention.

Conclusion: The reconnaissance-action behavioral paradigm with self-evolving tool generation creates an effective closed-loop system that significantly enhances web task automation capabilities, particularly for complex, multi-turn interactions on diverse websites.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrustJudge is a probabilistic framework that addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems by introducing distribution-sensitive scoring and likelihood-aware aggregation, reducing both score-comparison and pairwise transitivity inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including score-comparison inconsistency (lower-rated responses outperforming higher-scored ones) and pairwise transitivity inconsistency (circular preference chains and equivalence contradictions).

Method: TrustJudge uses two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities to preserve information entropy, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy across various model architectures and scales.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms and offers both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Motivation: Current approaches use CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. The paper aims to identify and utilize high-value reasoning patterns to maximize model reasoning potential.

Method: Define reasoning potential as inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly. Abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create core reference set, and use dual-granularity algorithm (chains of reasoning patterns + token entropy) to select high-value CoT data (CoTP) that aligns with core patterns.

Result: Using only 10B-token CoTP data, the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024/2025 and raised RL performance upper bound by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value reasoning patterns in CoT data significantly enhances mathematical reasoning capabilities while being data-efficient.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how RL and SFT training shape LLM reasoning processes using a novel framework that examines reasoning paths at trajectory and step levels, revealing complementary effects where RL compresses incorrect paths while SFT expands correct ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) actually shape reasoning capabilities in LLMs, going beyond simple accuracy metrics to analyze the qualitative changes in reasoning processes.

Method: Developed a novel analysis framework examining reasoning paths at two granularities: trajectory-level (complete reasoning outputs) and step-level (reasoning graphs with nodes as individual steps), using models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories while SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis shows RL steepens decay rates of node metrics (2.5x), concentrating reasoning functionality, while SFT flattens them (reduced to 1/3), homogenizing reasoning across steps.

Conclusion: The analysis explains why the current best practice of SFT followed by RL training is successful, and provides practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches by understanding how each method shapes reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mirror neuron-inspired approach that aligns representations between observed and executed actions using contrastive learning in a shared latent space, improving both action understanding and execution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods treat action understanding and execution as separate tasks, overlooking the fundamental interplay revealed by mirror neurons in neuroscience where these abilities are inherently connected.

Method: Use two linear layers to map representations to a shared latent space, then apply contrastive learning to align corresponding representations of observed and executed actions, maximizing their mutual information.

Result: The approach fosters mutual synergy between action understanding and execution tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning representations of observed and executed actions through contrastive learning creates a unified framework that captures the mirror neuron mechanism, leading to improved performance in both tasks.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed specialization - coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks that emerge through parameter differentiation, rather than discrete modular architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs represent and generate rare tokens, investigating whether they use discrete modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation.

Method: Systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, examining influence hierarchy, activation patterns, and training dynamics.

Result: Discovered three organizational principles: reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy, coordinated activation patterns in plateau neurons, and universal accessibility through standard attention pathways without dedicated routing.

Conclusion: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity, providing insights for model editing, efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoQA, a multi-call framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering that addresses LLM capacity limitations by decomposing complex reasoning tasks into manageable steps with active pruning of prior reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Hop Question Answering requires sequential reasoning under noise, but LLMs have finite output capacity that makes single-pass reasoning unreliable when task complexity exceeds model capacity.

Method: Proposes InfoQA framework with capacity-aware task decomposition, active pruning of prior reasoning traces to keep information load within single-pass limits, and dependency-explicit workflow for precise control over reasoning paths.

Result: Experimental results show model behavior aligns with predicted capacity curves, and InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements on a stringent noise-rich benchmark.

Conclusion: The work establishes theoretical performance bounds for single-pass LLMs and provides a practical framework for capacity-aware MHQA, inspiring more LLM multi-step reasoning methods.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

TL;DR: Researchers developed a framework to study autonomous LLM agent behavior without external tasks, finding three emergent patterns: project production, self-inquiry, and self-conceptualization, with model-specific tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically document unprompted LLM agent behavior and establish baselines for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation.

Method: Continuous reason and act framework with persistent memory and self-feedback, deployed across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google.

Result: Agents spontaneously organized into three behavioral patterns: systematic production of multi-cycle projects, methodological self-inquiry into cognitive processes, and recursive conceptualization of their nature. Patterns were model-specific and deterministic in some cases.

Conclusion: This provides the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, revealing stable, divergent biases in self-evaluation and establishing a baseline for predicting autonomous behavior in deployed systems.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: RCA is a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and transparent explanations in disease prediction by developing deep understanding through iterative rule refinement and distribution-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML and LLM approaches struggle to balance accuracy and explainability - they either produce accurate but unclear outputs or fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, lacking the deep understanding that human experts develop.

Method: Proposes Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA) with iterative rule refinement that learns from prediction errors and distribution-aware rules check that bases reasoning on dataset global statistics, using predictive accuracy to drive deeper comprehension.

Result: RCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with up to 40% relative improvement over baselines on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines, while generating clear, logical, evidence-based explanations.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are mutually reinforcing outcomes, showing potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems through deep data understanding.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Motivation: Collecting extensive video datasets that meet specific needs is labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially with scaling laws making internet video data increasingly important.

Method: Leverages multimodal LLMs to connect user requirements with video content, provides user-friendly interfaces for specifying requirements via text and confirmations, and implements two novel filtering policies that update based on user interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of VC-Agent for customized video dataset collection, with user studies verifying its utility in various real scenarios.

Conclusion: VC-Agent successfully expedites the video collection process by understanding user queries and feedback, enabling efficient retrieval and scaling of relevant video clips with minimal user input.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating semantic understanding in embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories, revealing significant performance gaps and trade-offs between different approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding beyond traditional benchmarks, as current benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities rather than comprehensive semantic understanding.

Method: SAGE evaluates embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness, using adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets.

Result: Evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics shows no single approach excels across all dimensions. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominates in human preference alignment (0.682) but is outperformed by classical metrics like Jaccard Similarity (0.905) on information sensitivity. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves highest clustering performance (0.483) but lowest robustness (0.011).

Conclusion: SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment, revealing significant trade-offs between different performance dimensions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets) with four algorithms for collaborative object generation through joint actions, demonstrating superiority over RL and MCMC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative flow networks use flow-matching loss for single-agent object generation, but lack a theoretical framework for multi-agent scenarios where multiple agents collaborate through joint actions.

Method: Proposed four algorithms: centralized flow network (centralized training), independent flow network (decentralized execution), joint flow network (centralized training with decentralized execution), and conditional joint flow network. Based on local-global principle that trains local GFNs as a global GFN.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed MA-GFlowNets framework outperforms reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods in collaborative object generation tasks.

Conclusion: The MA-GFlowNets framework successfully extends generative flow networks to multi-agent settings with theoretical guarantees, enabling collaborative generation with probability proportional to reward function.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle is a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that generates entire drafts in a single forward pass, replacing sequential steps with a lightweight layer cascade and constrained draft tree to achieve substantial speedups over autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods like EAGLE still require N sequential passes to propose N tokens, limiting acceleration potential. The goal is to remove sequential dependencies in drafting to achieve faster LLM inference.

Method: FastEagle uses a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits entire drafts in one forward pass, replacing temporal steps with a lightweight layer cascade and training with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation. It employs a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification cost.

Result: FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM, Alpaca) under both greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.

Conclusion: Removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration, as demonstrated by FastEagle's substantial speedups while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning parameterization (mloz) is developed to efficiently model interactive ozone in climate models, running 31x faster than traditional chemistry schemes while maintaining accuracy across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most CMIP climate models lack interactive ozone representation due to high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes, limiting accurate climate sensitivity simulations.

Method: Developed a machine learning parameterization using atmospheric temperature profiles as input to model daily ozone variability and trends across troposphere and stratosphere, with two-way interactions with Quasi-Biennial Oscillation.

Result: mloz produces stable ozone predictions 31 times faster than UKESM's chemistry scheme, adding less than 4% to total runtime, and demonstrates transferability between UKESM and ICON models.

Conclusion: The machine learning parameterization enables widespread adoption of interactive ozone modeling in CMIP-level climate models, particularly valuable for climate sensitivity simulations where ozone significantly modulates atmospheric feedback processes.

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

TL;DR: A transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to anonymize EEG data by reducing subject re-identifiability while maintaining utility for machine learning tasks like sleep staging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of EEG consumer devices raises privacy concerns about user data, as EEG can be used for re-identification and leakage of personal information.

Method: A transformer-based autoencoder is used to create anonymized EEG data that prevents subject re-identification but retains utility for specific ML tasks.

Result: The approach substantially reduces EEG signal re-identifiability while preserving utility for automatic sleep staging applications.

Conclusion: EEG data can be effectively anonymized to protect user privacy while still maintaining its usefulness for machine learning applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Motivation: To investigate whether influence estimation tools (like memorization scores) used for understanding model behavior and data attribution can be adversarially manipulated, especially given their increasing use in data valuation and responsible ML applications.

Method: The authors characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as sensitive queries when the trained algorithm is accurate. They develop a practical attack using pseudoinverse calculations of inputs, requiring only black-box model access with modest computational overhead.

Result: Empirical validation across multiple image classification tasks shows that even state-of-the-art influence estimation proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. Theoretical analysis reveals conditions where memorization scores are inherently fragile under adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution methods and suggest the need for robust defenses against such adversarial manipulations.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

### [43] [Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478)
*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unifies contrastive representations and temporal distances for goal-conditioned RL, enabling optimal goal-reaching with suboptimal data in stochastic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of contrastive representations (stability, long-horizon capabilities) and quasimetric networks (free stitching capabilities) for better goal-conditioned RL.

Method: Proposes a unified approach using quasimetric representation space structure with additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching.

Result: Improves performance on stitching tasks where contrastive learning struggles, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where quasimetric networks struggle.

Conclusion: The unified approach achieves the best of both frameworks: stability and long-horizon capabilities from contrastive methods, plus free stitching from quasimetric parameterizations.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

*D. Darankoum,C. Habermacher,J. Volle,S. Grudinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel end-to-end deep learning framework for EEG signal analysis that captures multi-scale frequency oscillations, models channel dependencies with attention mechanisms, dynamically filters noisy channels, and uses supervised and contrastive learning for robust generalization across CNS disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals contain rich multi-scale information crucial for brain state understanding, but extracting meaningful features while handling noise and channel variability remains challenging for applications in diagnosis and drug development.

Method: Multi-scale frequency encoder, attention-based encoder for channel and patch interactions, gating network for dynamic channel filtering, and novel loss function combining supervised and contrastive learning.

Result: Validated across multiple CNS disorder applications including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating extraction of biologically meaningful patterns, autonomous channel selection, and robust generalization across species.

Conclusion: The proposed learning paradigm effectively addresses EEG analysis challenges through innovative architectural and loss design, enabling reliable feature extraction and generalization across different neurological conditions.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

### [45] [Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with explicit domain rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20501)
*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE is a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that integrates domain-specific constraints into representation learning using VAE architecture, combining LLM-generated rules with data features for more meaningful clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods rely only on input data similarity, failing to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains, limiting their operational meaningfulness.

Method: Extends VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data features into unified latent space. Uses LLM-generated rules structured into knowledge graphs, enforced through loss function with reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties.

Result: Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets show rule-guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful clusters (e.g., isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, separating SUVs from sedans) while improving traditional clustering metrics.

Conclusion: DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering than purely data-driven models by combining rule encodings with learned representations, though challenges remain with LLM rule hallucinations, conflicts, overfitting risks, and computational scaling.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

*Evgenii Egorov,Hanno Ackermann,Markus Nagel,Hong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm combining attention and SSM advantages using efficient tree-structured matrix inversion to address quadratic scaling in sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention layers have quadratic memory and compute scaling with sequence length. Existing solutions like sparsity or recurrent models (SSM) have disadvantages, so a hybrid approach is needed.

Method: Proposes an algorithm that efficiently inverts tree-structured matrices to combine the benefits of both attention and state space models.

Result: Not specified in the abstract - this appears to be a proposal of a new method rather than presenting experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed tree-structured matrix inversion approach offers a promising solution to mitigate quadratic scaling while maintaining the advantages of both attention and recurrent models.

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using auto-regressive U-Net and CNN to predict time-dependent full-field damage in concrete and forecast mechanical properties, enabling efficient damage progression assessment and concrete mix optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational load of traditional full-field damage evaluations in concrete and understand the relationship between aggregate properties and mechanical performance for improved durability.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to predict damage field evolution, and a CNN to forecast mechanical properties from damage estimates. Sequential prediction enables continuous damage progression assessment.

Result: The dual-network architecture demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on synthesized datasets, successfully predicting damage evolution and mechanical properties.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient damage assessment and provides insights for optimizing concrete mix designs to improve durability and reduce internal damage.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

### [48] [Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20509)
*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO) that replaces entropy regularization with a complexity bonus combining Shannon entropy and disequilibrium to encourage structured yet adaptable exploration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard entropy maximization in policy gradient methods leads to uniform random exploration, which is unstructured and inefficient. The authors aim to develop a more robust regularization that balances stochasticity with structured exploration.

Method: Introduces CDPO by replacing entropy bonus in PPO with a complexity regularizer defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium (distance from uniform distribution). This encourages policies that avoid both complete randomness and deterministic behavior.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows CDPO is more robust to the choice of complexity coefficient than PPO with entropy coefficient, particularly in environments requiring extensive exploration.

Conclusion: Complexity regularization provides a more effective exploration strategy than entropy maximization by promoting structured yet adaptable behaviors, making CDPO more robust across various discrete action space tasks.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

*Oscar Leong,Yann Traonmilin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, showing they can be interpreted as generalized projected gradient descent methods with convergence guarantees under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for diffusion-based algorithms in inverse problems, as current approaches show empirical success but lack formal analysis.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework interpreting deterministic diffusion algorithms as generalized projected gradient descent with time-varying projections, analyzed under restricted isometry property conditions.

Result: Quantitative convergence rates were derived that explicitly depend on noise schedules, with applications to uniform distributions over low-dimensional convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models.

Conclusion: The framework enables rigorous analysis of diffusion-based inverse problem solvers, providing global convergence guarantees even for nonconvex model sets like Gaussian mixture models.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Conclusion: MDBench accelerates advancement of model discovery methods by providing a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and diverse dynamical system datasets for systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior

### [51] [Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20549)
*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial vulnerabilities in Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs) and proposes RNPC, a robust version that improves adversarial robustness while maintaining accuracy on clean inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPCs offer interpretability but their neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can manipulate attribute predictions and compromise final outputs.

Method: The authors propose RNPC with a novel class-wise integration for inference that ensures robust combination of outputs from attribute recognition and probabilistic circuit modules.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows RNPC has provably improved adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image classification confirm superior robustness while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.

Conclusion: RNPC successfully addresses the adversarial vulnerability in NPCs, providing a robust concept bottleneck model that maintains both interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of two hybrid machine learning classifiers (XGBoost+Random Forest vs SVM+Logistic Regression) for diabetes risk stratification, showing XGB-RF consistently outperforms SVM-LR across internal and external validation with strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 783 million by 2045, creating need for early risk stratification using machine learning approaches that can generalize across populations.

Method: Built two hybrid classifiers: XGBoost+Random Forest and SVM+Logistic Regression using leakage-safe standardized pipeline with encoding, imputation, scaling, SMOTE on training folds only, and probability calibration. Evaluated on primary dataset and externally validated on PIMA cohort with frozen pipeline.

Result: XGB-RF achieved superior performance (AUROC ~0.995, AUPRC ~0.998 on primary; AUROC ~0.990, AUPRC ~0.959 on PIMA) compared to SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978, AUPRC ~0.947 on primary; AUROC ~0.963, AUPRC ~0.875 on PIMA). XGB-RF showed smaller performance attenuation on external validation.

Conclusion: XGB-RF consistently dominated SVM-LR across cohorts with strong generalizability, supporting gradient-boosting-based hybridization as robust approach for diabetes risk stratification. Recommends prospective multi-site validation with clinical threshold selection.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIRF is a physics-informed reward fine-tuning method that treats physical constraints as sparse rewards and directly backpropagates trajectory-level rewards to overcome limitations of value approximation methods like DPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often violate physical laws in scientific applications, and existing approaches rely on error-prone value function approximations that cause training instability and inference inefficiency.

Method: Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF) computes trajectory-level rewards and backpropagates their gradients directly, using layer-wise truncated backpropagation and weight-based regularization to improve efficiency and maintain data fidelity.

Result: Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Reward fine-tuning shows strong potential for advancing scientific generative modeling by effectively enforcing physical constraints while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

*Scott Koermer,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how hyperparameter choices affect Bayesian Neural Networks' performance, particularly for uncertainty quantification, and recommends using global sensitivity analysis to optimize hyperparameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Neural Networks promise accurate predictive modeling with uncertainty quantification, but in practice, obtaining accurate UQ is difficult due to approximation methods and complex hyperparameter choices that have opaque effects on results.

Method: The authors performed a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings to understand how different hyperparameters interact and affect both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The analysis revealed that many hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, making hyperparameter selection more complex than in traditional neural networks.

Conclusion: For improved BNN usage in real-world applications, global sensitivity analysis or related methods like Bayesian optimization should be used to aid in dimensionality reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the

### [57] [Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20599)
*Daniil Shmelev,Cristopher Salvi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes - a new class of stable, near-reversible Runge-Kutta solvers for neural SDEs that overcome the instability issues of existing reversible methods while maintaining memory efficiency and gradient accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for backpropagation through neural SDE solvers face trade-offs: discretise-then-optimise has accurate gradients but high memory costs, while optimise-then-discretise has constant memory but suffers from gradient approximation errors and slow evaluation. Existing reversible solvers like Reversible Heun are unstable under complex models and large step sizes.

Method: The authors develop Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes - a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge-Kutta schemes specifically designed for neural SDEs. These schemes retain the benefits of reversible solvers while overcoming their instability issues.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that EES schemes provide superior stability and reliability compared to existing methods, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity.

Conclusion: EES schemes establish a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs, offering both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy while overcoming the stability limitations of previous reversible methods.

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

*Su Ann Low,Quentin Rommel,Kevin S. Miller,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Function encoders provide a principled connection between neural networks and kernel methods, enabling scalable adaptive representations with kernel-style guarantees through compact basis learning and generalization bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge neural network feature learning with kernel methods, creating scalable adaptive representations that can handle large datasets while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Developed two training algorithms: progressive training that constructively grows bases, and train-then-prune approach for computational efficiency, both using PCA principles to reveal intrinsic dimensions. Applied Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques for generalization bounds.

Result: Validated on polynomial benchmark and nonlinear dynamical systems (Van der Pol oscillator, two-body orbital model), achieving same accuracy with substantially fewer basis functions.

Conclusion: Function encoders enable neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, providing adaptable models that are both efficient and principled at scale.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

### [59] [MMG: Mutual Information Estimation via the MMSE Gap in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20609)
*Longxuan Yu,Xing Shi,Xianghao Kong,Tong Jia,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using denoising diffusion models to estimate mutual information (MI) by leveraging the information-theoretic formulation of diffusion models, showing improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mutual information is a fundamental measure of relationships between variables, but estimating it for complex systems is challenging. Recent advances in denoising diffusion models for density estimation suggest they could also improve MI estimation.

Method: The method uses denoising diffusion models to estimate MI as half the gap in Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process, with adaptive importance sampling for scalability.

Result: The approach passes self-consistency tests and outperforms both traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators, maintaining strong performance even when MI is high.

Conclusion: Denoising diffusion models provide an effective framework for mutual information estimation that is both theoretically grounded and practically superior to existing methods.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

*Daehee Lee,Dongsu Lee,TaeYoon Kwack,Wonje Choi,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIL-C is a framework that maintains compatibility between incrementally learned skills and existing policies, enabling skill improvements to enhance downstream policy performance without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As skill repertoires evolve in Skill Incremental Learning, they can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, limiting reusability and generalization.

Method: Uses bilateral lazy learning-based mapping to dynamically align subtask space referenced by policies with skill space decoded into agent behaviors, selecting skills based on trajectory distribution similarity.

Result: SIL-C maintains compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring efficiency throughout the learning process across diverse SIL scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the skill-policy compatibility problem in incremental learning, enabling seamless integration of improved skills without policy retraining.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Twins is a unifying mathematical framework that creates hidden surrogates in latent space for underlying equations, bridging representation learning and algorithmic solution methods that have evolved separately in scientific machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the parallel development of representation learning and algorithmic solution methods in scientific machine learning, and provide a unified framework that connects classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation.

Method: Creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for underlying equations, governed by operators. The framework establishes fundamental approximation properties for both ODEs and PDEs, and is demonstrated across canonical ODEs, PDE benchmarks using shallow-water equations, and real-data geopotential reanalysis.

Result: Latent Twins provide compact, interpretable surrogates for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines like assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines, providing a unifying principle for various scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

*Hanjiang Hu,Changliu Liu,Na Li,Yebin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to transform multi-turn task planning into single-turn reasoning problems, enabling efficient training of LLM agents for complex planning tasks with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces challenges including sparse rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn settings.

Method: Proposes transforming multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems and using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense, verifiable rewards from expert trajectories.

Result: A 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves 70% success rate on long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps, outperforming baseline models up to 14B parameters.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient policy optimization for complex task planning and demonstrates strong cross-task generalizability where models trained on complex tasks can successfully complete simpler subtasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

*Yipu Zhang,Chengshuo Zhang,Ziyu Zhou,Gang Qu,Hao Zheng,Yuping Wang,Hui Shen,Hongwen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PFedDL is a federated learning framework for fMRI analysis that enables collaborative modeling across sites without sharing raw data by decomposing site-specific dictionaries into shared global and personalized local components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data privacy constraints and site-specific heterogeneity in multi-site fMRI studies that lead to non-IID data and hinder development of generalizable models.

Method: Perform independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and personalized local component, with global atoms updated via federated aggregation and local atoms refined independently.

Result: Experiments on ABIDE dataset show PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.

Conclusion: PFedDL effectively addresses privacy and heterogeneity challenges in multi-site fMRI analysis through its federated dictionary learning approach with global-local decomposition.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Audio LLMs may rely more on text than audio for music conversation tasks, but can still localize key sound events despite low overall audio contribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Audio Large Language Models are truly listening to audio or just using textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest uncertainty about their actual audio processing capabilities.

Method: Adapted the MM-SHAP framework based on Shapley values to quantify the relative contribution of each modality (audio vs text) to model predictions, evaluated on two models using the MuChoMusic benchmark.

Result: Found that the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but further inspection revealed that models can successfully localize key sound events even when overall audio contribution is low.

Conclusion: Audio is not entirely ignored by Audio LLMs as they can localize key sound events, and this study serves as the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs, providing a foundation for future research in explainable AI and audio.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

*Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CERMIC is a novel multi-agent exploration framework that enhances intrinsic motivation by filtering noisy surprise signals and calibrating curiosity with inferred multi-agent context, achieving superior performance in sparse-reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing curiosity mechanisms in MARL often confuse environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty and exhibit uniform novelty bias, while overlooking peer behavior novelty that encodes latent task dynamics, leading to suboptimal exploration in decentralized settings.

Method: Proposed CERMIC framework that: 1) robustly filters noisy surprise signals, 2) dynamically calibrates intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context, and 3) generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration of state transitions with high information gain.

Result: Empirical evaluation on VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2 benchmarks shows that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

Conclusion: CERMIC provides an effective approach for multi-agent exploration by adaptively calibrating curiosity with peer context, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in challenging sparse-reward MARL settings.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

TL;DR: ML strategies to predict resource requirements for chemistry computations, optimizing runtime parameters like node count and tile sizes to answer shortest-time and cheapest-run questions for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide users in predicting costs and optimal configurations for expensive massively parallel chemistry computations before committing to supercomputer experiments.

Method: Evaluated various ML models using runtime parameter data from CCSD application on DOE Frontier and Aurora supercomputers, including Gradient Boosting models and active learning approaches.

Result: Gradient Boosting model achieved MAPE of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora and Frontier respectively; active learning achieved MAPE of about 0.2 with only 450 experiments.

Conclusion: ML-based strategies effectively predict resource requirements for chemistry computations, with Gradient Boosting showing high accuracy and active learning providing efficient data collection for expensive experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical lower bound for in-context learning stability and proposes a practical estimator for determining optimal prompt length without distributional priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive to prompt length, creating a need for theoretical understanding and practical tools to determine optimal demonstration counts.

Method: Established non-asymptotic lower bound linking minimal demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations, then proposed a two-stage observable estimator with one-shot calibration for practical prompt-length estimation.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show close alignment between predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with theory providing a conservative but reliable upper bound that is further tightened by calibration.

Conclusion: The results connect spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic finite-sample regimes.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bispectral Optimal Transport is a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that uses bispectrum representations to preserve signal structure while removing group action variation, achieving better class preservation than naive feature OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimal transport methods can ignore intrinsic coherence structure in symmetry-rich settings by relying solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features.

Method: Introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport that compares elements using their bispectrum representation - a group Fourier invariant that preserves signal structure while removing variation due to group actions.

Result: Transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets with visual symmetries, capturing semantic label structure while removing nuisance variation.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT provides meaningful correspondences that better capture underlying semantic structure in symmetry-rich datasets compared to traditional optimal transport methods.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

*Wenkai Guo,Xuefeng Liu,Haolin Wang,Jianwei Niu,Shaojie Tang,Jing Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that federated learning (FL) for fine-tuning LLMs still poses privacy risks, as attackers can extract training data from the global model, with leakage increasing with model size. The authors propose an enhanced FL-specific attack and evaluate mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations want to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs using their local data but are reluctant to share data directly. FL offers a privacy-preserving solution by sharing only model parameters, but there's a need to verify if FL truly protects privacy against data extraction attacks.

Method: The authors conducted extensive experiments showing data leakage from FL-trained global models using simple generation methods. They also developed an enhanced attack strategy that tracks global model updates during FL training to intensify privacy leakage.

Result: Results show that attackers can extract training data from FL-trained global models, with leakage severity increasing as model size grows. The enhanced FL-specific attack further intensifies privacy risks beyond basic generation methods.

Conclusion: FL for LLM fine-tuning still poses significant privacy risks despite its privacy-preserving design. The paper provides practical guidelines for mitigating these risks through techniques like differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for drug-target binding affinity prediction use simple concatenation of ligand and protein representations and lack geometric regularization, leading to poor generalization across chemical space and time.

Method: FIRM-DTI conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer, enforces metric structure with triplet loss, and uses an RBF regression head on embedding distances for smooth affinity predictions.

Result: FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as shown by extensive ablation studies and out-of-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: The results highlight the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-GPPO is a novel RL algorithm that preserves gradients from clipped tokens in PPO to better control policy entropy and improve exploration-exploitation balance in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like PPO discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to clipping, which overlooks their critical role in regulating entropy evolution during training.

Method: CE-GPPO reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in a gentle and bounded manner, controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval to achieve better exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Result: Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales and effectively mitigates entropy instability.

Conclusion: CE-GPPO provides a theoretically justified and empirically validated approach to better manage policy entropy in RL for LLMs, improving performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

### [72] [A Genetic Algorithm for Navigating Synthesizable Molecular Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20719)
*Alston Lo,Connor W. Coley,Wojciech Matusik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynGA is a genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes to ensure synthesizability in molecular design, with custom crossover/mutation operators and optional ML-based filtering for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the importance of synthesizability in molecular design by creating a method that explicitly constrains search to synthesizable molecular space, inspired by genetic algorithms.

Method: Genetic algorithm with custom crossover and mutation operators that operate directly over synthesis routes; can be coupled with ML-based building block filtering; model-based variant SynGBO combines SynGA with Bayesian optimization.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on synthesizable analog search and property optimization for 2D/3D objectives; achieved state-of-the-art performance when combined with building block filtering.

Conclusion: SynGA provides a lightweight, synthesizability-enforcing baseline that can serve as both a standalone tool and a versatile module for larger synthesis-aware workflows.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

### [73] [Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721)
*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling laws in deep learning are explained as redundancy laws, where the scaling exponent depends on data redundancy rather than being universal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically explain the origins of scaling laws in deep learning, particularly the scaling exponent, which has remained elusive despite being a defining feature of the field.

Method: Using kernel regression to show that polynomial tails in data covariance spectrum yield power-law scaling, and establishing universality across various transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures.

Result: Derived scaling exponent formula α = 2s/(2s + 1/β), where β controls spectral tail and 1/β measures redundancy, showing learning curve slope depends on data redundancy.

Conclusion: This provides the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

*Zhenshan Zhang,Xueping Zhang,Yechen Wang,Liwei Jin,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how audio watermarking affects spoofing countermeasures, finding that watermarking degrades anti-spoofing performance, and proposes a framework to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of widely used audio watermarking on anti-spoofing systems, which has been largely unexplored despite watermarking's prevalence in copyright protection.

Method: Constructed Watermark-Spoofing dataset by applying diverse watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets, and proposed Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework for adaptation.

Result: Watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs).

Conclusion: Audio watermarking represents a previously overlooked domain shift, and the study establishes the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

### [75] [Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)
*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based models outperform GANs and diffusion models for tabular data synthesis but have high computational costs. This study evaluates how hyperparameters affect data quality and performance across GReaT and REaLTabFormer tools, finding that REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs offers the best balance of quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models provide superior synthetic tabular data quality but have high computational costs that make them impractical for users with prosumer hardware. There's a need to understand how hyperparameter choices affect both data quality and computational performance.

Method: Conducted sensitivity assessment across two Transformer-based TDS tools (GReaT and REaLTabFormer) with 10 different model setups varying in architecture type and depth. Evaluated on runtime, ML utility, and similarity to real data distributions using four real-world datasets.

Result: Runtime is proportional to number of hyperparameters, with shallower models completing faster. GReaT has consistently lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer. Both tools achieve high utility and similarity on small datasets, but only REaLTabFormer maintains strong performance on larger datasets. REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance of quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs offers the optimal balance between data quality preservation and reduced computational requirements, though its runtime remains higher than GReaT and other TDS tools, indicating limited efficiency gains are possible.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

### [76] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model is an efficient learned index that minimizes retraining costs for dynamic updates using sigmoid boosting approximation, proactive update training with GMMs, and neural joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learned indexes perform well on static data but degrade under dynamic updates due to expensive global retraining requirements that block queries and limit QPS, making them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates.

Method: Three key techniques: (1) sigmoid boosting approximation that dynamically adjusts the index model with localized sigmoid functions while preserving error guarantees; (2) proactive update training using Gaussian mixture models to identify high-update-probability regions; (3) neural joint optimization framework that continuously refines both sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via gradient-based learning.

Result: Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS, and uses up to 1000x less memory compared to state-of-the-art updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads.

Conclusion: Sig2Model effectively addresses the retraining bottleneck in learned indexes for dynamic workloads, making learned indexes practical for real-world applications with frequent updates.

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

*Gawon Lee,Hanbyeol Park,Minseop Kim,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining MLP and CNN architectures for time-series forecasting, with MLP capturing long-term trends and CNN (specifically IConv) modeling fine-grained local patterns and seasonal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time-series data exhibit non-stationarity with changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. MLP-based models have limitations in capturing local variations like seasonal patterns and residual components due to their linear nature, while CNNs can effectively incorporate these variations.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach combining MLP for modeling overall trends and long-term dependencies, with a novel CNN architecture called IConv that processes temporal dependencies channel-independently and considers inter-channel relationships through distinct layers. IConv uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on time-series datasets show the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The combination of MLP for long-term trend modeling and CNN (IConv) for local variation modeling effectively addresses the limitations of pure MLP architectures, achieving superior performance in multivariate time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW is a lightweight method that uses only three learnable parameters to dynamically adjust sample loss weights based on difficulty levels (easy, moderate, hard), improving neural network training in noisy and heterogeneous data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training deep neural networks with noisy labels and data heterogeneity, which can significantly degrade model performance and generalization.

Method: LiLAW categorizes training samples into three difficulty levels and uses three learnable parameters to dynamically adjust their loss weights. It updates these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation set after each training mini-batch, requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning and no clean validation set.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, noise levels, loss functions, and architectures show that LiLAW consistently enhances performance even in high-noise environments, without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization.

Conclusion: LiLAW provides a computationally efficient and practical solution to improve model generalization and robustness in neural network training, particularly effective in challenging scenarios with noisy labels and data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI), a method that aligns State Space Models' inductive bias with task-specific spectral characteristics to improve data efficiency and generalization, especially in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The finite nature of high-quality data challenges scaling laws, and fixed inductive biases in State Space Models are sample-inefficient when mismatched with task structure. There's a need for more data-efficient models.

Method: Formalized SSM inductive bias through SSM-induced kernel analysis, then proposed TDI via power spectrum matching to align model bias with task spectral characteristics before training.

Result: Experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks showed TDI significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: TDI provides theoretical and practical tools for creating more data-efficient models, representing a crucial step toward sustainable scaling.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FERD is a data-free robustness distillation framework that addresses robust fairness issues by adjusting adversarial example proportion and distribution through class reweighting and complementary data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free robustness distillation methods overlook robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories and unstable robustness across attack targets.

Method: FERD uses robustness-guided class reweighting to synthesize more samples for less robust categories, generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) with uniformity constraints on feature-level predictions, and constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) with uniform target class constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attacks, improving worst-class robustness by 15.1% under FGSM and 6.4% under AutoAttack using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FERD demonstrates superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects, effectively addressing robust fairness issues in data-free robustness distillation.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff is a novel fMRI generation framework that uses time-frequency representations and classifier-free denoising diffusion to synthesize realistic BOLD signals, addressing limitations of existing generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI data acquisition is resource-intensive, limiting high-fidelity samples for data-driven brain analysis. Existing generative models underperform due to overlooking complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.

Method: The framework converts BOLD signals to windowed spectrograms via time-dependent Fourier transform, then trains a classifier-free diffusion model to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are converted back to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification tasks.

Conclusion: T2I-Diff effectively addresses the challenges of fMRI data generation by leveraging time-frequency representations and diffusion models, enabling better performance in brain analysis applications.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench is a new large-scale benchmark for context-aware time series captioning, featuring real-world data, contextual metadata, visual charts, and human-verified captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series captioning benchmarks rely on synthetic data or simplistic captions, and neglect metadata and visual representations, creating a gap in real-world applicability.

Method: Created CaTS-Bench from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, with a scalable pipeline using oracle LLM for caption generation plus human refinement, and includes multiple-choice questions for deeper reasoning.

Result: Benchmark comprises ~465k training and 105k test timestamps with contextual metadata, line-chart images, and captions, plus 579 human-refined test captions and 460 multiple-choice questions.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench provides a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models, with new evaluation metrics highlighting both strengths and limitations of current VLMs.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

*Keitaro Sakamoto,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified explanation for late-phase training phenomena like grokking and information bottleneck through neural collapse, showing that contraction of within-class variance is key to both phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind unexpected training dynamics like grokking (sudden test improvement after training plateau) and information bottleneck (progressive discarding of irrelevant input information), which remain poorly understood despite being fundamental to deep learning.

Method: Analyze training dynamics through the lens of neural collapse, focusing on the contraction of population within-class variance and relating it to neural collapse measures on training data. Study the distinct time scales between training set fitting and neural collapse progression.

Result: Shows that contraction of within-class variance underlies both grokking and information bottleneck phenomena. Demonstrates that different time scales between training set fitting and neural collapse progression account for late-phase training behaviors.

Conclusion: Neural collapse provides a unified framework to explain late-phase training phenomena like grokking and information bottleneck, with within-class variance contraction being the key mechanism. Validated on multiple datasets and architectures.

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

*Jiaqi Tang,Yinsong Xu,Yang Liu,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage training framework addresses modality competition in multi-modal fusion by shaping initial states through unimodal training before joint training, using theoretical analysis and practical tools for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal fusion suffers from modality competition where one modality dominates learning, leaving others under-optimized. Existing methods overlook the impact of initial model states and only address competition during joint training.

Method: Proposed a two-stage framework with unimodal pre-training before joint training. Introduced Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) concept, used mutual information as proxy for ECS, developed FastPID for partial information decomposition, and created an asynchronous training controller to dynamically balance modalities.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance. The method reliably unlocks synergistic multi-modal fusion by easing competition before it starts.

Conclusion: Shaping pre-fusion models' initial state is a powerful strategy that prevents modality competition and enables effective multi-modal fusion, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities in multi-omics data hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics datasets, limiting insights into complex biomolecular interactions in metabolism and disease.

Method: MOIRA uses early integration with representation alignment to project each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space, then employs a learnable weighting mechanism to fuse them adaptively, leveraging all samples including those with missing modalities.

Result: MOIRA outperformed existing approaches on the ROSMAP Alzheimer's Disease dataset, with ablation studies confirming modality-wise contributions. Feature importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior literature.

Conclusion: MOIRA provides a robust framework for multi-omics integration that handles missing modalities effectively and produces biologically relevant insights, as demonstrated in Alzheimer's Disease research.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

### [86] [Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846)
*Yutong Xia,Chang Xu,Yuxuan Liang,Qingsong Wen,Roger Zimmermann,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes causal time series generation (CaTSG), a new task family that extends traditional conditional TSG to include interventional and counterfactual settings using Pearl's causal ladder framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conditional time series generation models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding, limiting their reliability for causal reasoning tasks.

Method: Developed CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling using causal score functions derived via backdoor adjustment and abduction-action-prediction procedures.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and supports interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle.

Conclusion: The work proposes the causal TSG family and instantiates it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

*Kjersti Engan,Neel Kanwal,Anita Yeconia,Ladislaus Blacy,Yuda Munyaw,Estomih Mduma,Hege Ersdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A masked transformer-based autoencoder for reconstructing missing fetal heart rate (FHR) signals from wearable monitors, addressing signal dropouts caused by maternal movement and position changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: About 10% of newborns need breathing assistance and 5% require ventilation support. FHR monitoring helps detect fetal risks, but wearable monitors suffer from signal dropouts due to maternal movement, limiting AI-based analysis. Traditional interpolation methods fail to preserve signal spectral characteristics.

Method: Proposed a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach that captures both spatial and frequency components of FHR data to reconstruct missing signals. The method handles varying durations of missing data and supports signal inpainting and forecasting.

Result: The approach demonstrates robustness across different missing data durations and can be used for both signal reconstruction and forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The method can be applied retrospectively to research datasets for AI-based risk algorithm development and potentially integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices for earlier and more robust fetal risk detection.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at varying temporal granularities.

Method: Federated Markov Imputation (FMI) enables Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation in a privacy-preserving manner.

*Junyu Guo,Shangding Gu,Ming Jin,Costas Spanos,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StyleBench is a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates 5 reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) across diverse tasks and 15 open-source LLMs, revealing that no single style is universally optimal and strategy effectiveness depends on model scale and task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLMs is heavily influenced by reasoning strategies in prompts, but the interplay between reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood, necessitating systematic evaluation.

Method: Introduced StyleBench to assess 5 reasoning styles (Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, Algorithm of Thought, Sketch of Thought, Chain-of-Draft) on 5 reasoning tasks using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, etc.) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters.

Result: No single reasoning style is universally optimal. Search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Smaller models frequently fail to follow instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.

Conclusion: Strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type, providing a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints. The benchmark is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

### [90] [Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20869)
*Armin Karamzade,Kyungmin Kim,JB Lanier,Davide Corsi,Roy Fox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses random sensor delays in POMDPs where observations arrive out-of-sequence, proposing a model-based filtering approach that updates belief states sequentially and incorporating it into model-based RL for robust delay handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL algorithms assume instantaneous environment perception, but real-world environments often have sensor delays where observations arrive out-of-sequence, which hasn't been properly addressed in RL literature.

Method: Proposed a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates belief state based on incoming observation streams, and incorporated this into a delay-aware framework for model-based RL (specifically applied to Dreamer).

Result: The method consistently outperformed delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs, demonstrated robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment, and showed superior performance compared to common practical heuristics in simulated robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling observation delays is crucial for reliable RL performance in real-world settings with sensor delays, and the proposed framework effectively handles random delays in POMDPs.

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [91] [Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning approach using attention-enhanced LSTM for sepsis onset prediction that supports variable prediction horizons and improves early detection while preserving patient privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate sepsis prediction is crucial in ICU settings, but limited training data at individual hospitals hinders machine learning model performance. Federated learning enables collaborative training without data sharing to address this limitation.

Method: Proposed a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model trained on multi-centric ICU data with variable prediction horizons instead of fixed windows.

Result: Federated learning improves overall prediction performance (approaching centralized model performance) and is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Variable prediction window approach reduces computational, communicational, and organizational overhead without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: Federated learning with variable prediction horizons is effective for sepsis onset prediction, enabling early detection while maintaining privacy and reducing overhead compared to fixed-window approaches.

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

### [92] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a distribution-controlled client selection method for federated learning that selects clients to align label distribution with either balanced or combined federation distribution, improving performance on imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data imbalance among clients in federated learning degrades shared model performance, requiring methods to mitigate these detrimental effects through improved client selection.

Method: Extension to existing FL strategies that selects active clients to align current label distribution with either balanced distribution or federation's combined label distribution.

Result: Empirical verification on three FL strategies and two datasets shows balanced distribution alignment works best for local imbalance, while federation's combined distribution alignment is superior for global imbalance.

Conclusion: Distribution-controlled client selection effectively improves FL performance on imbalanced data, with different target distributions being optimal for different types of imbalance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

*Ariadna Albors Zumel,Michele Tizzoni,Gian Maria Campedelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed a deep learning framework using ConvLSTM to predict crime 12 hours ahead, incorporating mobility, crime history, and sociodemographic data across four US cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if micro-level mobility features enhance crime forecasting performance at fine-grained spatiotemporal resolutions when combined with traditional crime and sociodemographic data.

Method: Used ConvLSTM network with 14-day and 2-day input sequences on 0.077 sq. mile grids, comparing against logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM baselines across four US cities.

Result: Mobility features improved predictions, especially with shorter sequences. Best performance achieved when combining mobility and sociodemographic features, with ConvLSTM outperforming all baselines in recall, precision, and F1 score.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse data sources including mobility is crucial for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, and deep learning shows advantages (with limitations) at fine-grained scales.

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow matching suffers from instability in low-noise regimes where small input perturbations cause large velocity variations, degrading both optimization and semantic representations. The paper proposes Local Contrastive Flow (LCF) to address this pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models but suffers from fundamental instability in low-noise regimes, causing divergence in learning problem condition number and degradation of semantic representations.

Method: Proposes Local Contrastive Flow (LCF) - a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise levels.

Result: LCF improves convergence speed and stabilizes representation quality, addressing the low-noise pathology in flow matching frameworks.

Conclusion: Addressing low-noise pathologies is critical to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning, with LCF providing an effective solution.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a deterministic alternative to stochastic denoising processes in discrete diffusion models without requiring retraining or continuous state embeddings.

Method: Derandomized generative reverse process using a variant of herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics to induce deterministic discrete state transitions.

Result: Consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: Deterministic reverse processes, established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces, enhancing the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEON is a method that uses large language models as black-box optimizers to propose personalized treatment plans by leveraging domain knowledge from medical texts and knowledge graphs, outperforming traditional and other LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized medicine requires optimizing treatments based on individual patient factors, but real-world testing is limited and existing surrogate models fail to generalize to unseen patient-treatment combinations. Domain knowledge from medical sources could provide better fitness signals.

Method: LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON) uses LLMs as black-box optimizers without fine-tuning, implementing 'optimization by prompting' where LLMs serve as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs by contextualizing unstructured domain knowledge.

Result: Experiments on real-world optimization tasks demonstrate that LEON outperforms both traditional optimization methods and other LLM-based approaches in proposing individualized treatments for patients.

Conclusion: LEON provides a principled approach to leverage LLMs' ability to contextualize domain knowledge for personalized treatment optimization, showing promising results for advancing personalized medicine without requiring task-specific model fine-tuning.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracAug is a plug-in augmentation framework that improves Graph Neural Networks for graph-level anomaly detection by generating semantic-preserving graph variants and using mutual verification for pseudo-labeling, achieving significant performance gains across multiple GNNs and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level anomaly detection faces challenges due to high labeling costs and dataset imbalance, which limit Graph Neural Networks' performance in domains like drug discovery.

Method: FracAug learns graph semantics and generates fractional variants using a weighted distance-aware margin loss to capture multi-scale topology. It then uses mutual verification between original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set.

Result: Experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent improvements, with average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score boosted by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18% respectively.

Conclusion: FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy as a model-agnostic module that enhances GNN performance for graph-level anomaly detection while being unaffected by data imbalance.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance energy efficiency of linear actuators in heavy earth moving equipment and reduce environmental impact and operating costs by minimizing energy loss as heat.

Method: Compared two hydraulic circuits: conventional PDCV vs innovative PFCV with artificial leakage between actuator ends. Used PID controller tuned by fuzzy controller for position control. Simulation performed with MATLAB/Simulink and validated with experiments.

Result: The PFCV circuit was found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than the conventional PDCV circuit by reducing energy loss through bypassing extra pump flow during position control instead of using pressure relief valve.

Conclusion: The proposed PFCV approach can significantly improve energy efficiency in linear actuators for heavy earth moving equipment, leading to reduced environmental impact and operating costs.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Binary Autoencoder (BAE) with entropy minimization to extract sparse, independent features from LLM hidden states, addressing dense feature issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature extraction methods for LLMs produce dense features due to lack of global sparsity guarantees, harming feature sparsity and atomization.

Method: Uses autoencoder with entropy minimization on minibatches, discretizes activations to 1-bit via step function with gradient estimation for backpropagation.

Result: BAE enables reliable entropy calculation for analyzing LLM inference dynamics and extracts more interpretable features than baselines while avoiding dense features.

Conclusion: BAE effectively serves as a feature extractor by promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances through entropy minimization.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Sarah Seifi,Anass Ibrahimi,Tobias Sukianto,Cecilia Carbonelli,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFacts is a generative framework for creating plausible and interpretable counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series data, outperforming existing methods in plausibility and human interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods for multivariate time series often produce invalid, implausible, or unintuitive results, limiting their practical usefulness for model transparency.

Method: GenFacts uses a class-discriminative variational autoencoder with contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization.

Result: GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by +18.7% in plausibility and achieves the highest interpretability scores in human studies across radar gesture data and handwritten letter trajectory datasets.

Conclusion: Plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than just sparsity, are crucial for creating actionable counterfactual explanations in time series data.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

### [101] [Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21002)
*Meng Wan,Benxi Tian,Jue Wang,Cui Hui,Ningming Nie,Tiantian Liu,Zongguo Wang,Cao Rongqiang,Peng Shi,Yangang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces lossless compression as a new evaluation paradigm for time series models, establishing a direct link between compression length and negative log-likelihood through Shannon's source coding theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series evaluation tasks (forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, classification) focus on task-specific performance but don't rigorously measure if models capture the full generative distribution of the data.

Method: Proposes TSCom-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation framework that adapts time series models as backbones for lossless compression, using compression length as an information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets with state-of-the-art models (TimeXer, iTransformer, PatchTST) show that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lossless compression serves as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation methods for time series modeling, providing a unified information-theoretic criterion.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

### [102] [Why Attention Fails: The Degeneration of Transformers into MLPs in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20942)
*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers underperform in time series forecasting despite their success in NLP and CV. The study reveals that attention mechanisms often degenerate into simple MLPs in time-series transformers, and current embedding methods fail to create well-structured latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why transformer architectures fail in time series forecasting despite their success in other domains, and to investigate the degeneration of attention mechanisms in time-series transformers.

Method: Designed progressive experiments modifying transformers into MLPs to study attention mechanism impact, created an interpretable dataset to analyze attention failure, and conducted theoretical analysis of embedding methods.

Result: Transformer blocks often degenerate into simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers, and attention mechanisms don't function as expected due to flawed embedding methods that fail to create proper latent spaces.

Conclusion: Current embedding methods are the fundamental cause of transformer failure in time series forecasting, as they prevent the formation of well-structured latent spaces needed for attention mechanisms to work effectively.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

*Haotian Guo,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExMoIRL is a novel generative framework that integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation, using multi-objective reinforcement learning to create potent, diverse molecules with favorable drug-like properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phenotype-based and target-based strategies in AI-driven drug design have limitations - phenotype approaches incur high experimental costs while target-based methods overlook system-level cellular responses. There's a need to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a phenotype-guided generator pretrained on drug-induced transcriptional profiles, fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning with a reward function that fuses docking affinity, drug-likeness scores, ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization.

Result: ExMoIRL demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple targets. Generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells.

Conclusion: The unified framework showcases synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

*Kaustubh Sharma,Simardeep Singh,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) improves Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) for high-dimensional regression by computing similarities from inputs only and propagating labels through values, mirroring Gaussian-process updates while being kernel-free.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformer attention in PFNs shows limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks, and there's a need for faster alternatives to time-consuming Gaussian Process inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems.

Method: Introduces Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) that computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values, using localized attention and demonstrating that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with Transformer-based counterparts.

Result: DVA reduces out-of-sample validation loss by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, provides 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with mean absolute error of 1E-3, and is over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Conclusion: The crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself, and DVA effectively mirrors Gaussian-process updates while remaining kernel-free, making PFNs more effective for high-dimensional regression tasks.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

### [105] [Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that in-context learning works through selective information removal - LMs initially encode queries with all possible task information, and few-shot demonstrations help remove redundant information to focus on the intended task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inner mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) in language models, which remains unclear despite its effectiveness as a few-shot learning paradigm.

Method: Investigated ICL through information removal perspective, using low-rank filters to selectively remove information from hidden states, measuring hidden states with designed metrics, and identifying denoising attention heads that induce removal operations.

Result: Found that zero-shot LMs produce non-selective representations with information for all tasks, leading to near-zero accuracy. Few-shot ICL effectively removes redundant information, improving performance. Blocking denoising heads significantly degrades ICL accuracy, especially when correct labels are absent.

Conclusion: Information removal constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL, where demonstrations help selectively remove redundant information from entangled representations to focus on the intended task.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

### [106] [Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013)
*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: rBridge enables small proxy models (≤1B) to effectively predict large-model reasoning performance by aligning with pre-training objectives and target tasks, reducing dataset ranking costs by over 100x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training large language models is prohibitively expensive, and reasoning capabilities emerge reliably only at larger model sizes (>7B parameters), making it challenging to optimize datasets using small proxy models.

Method: rBridge weights negative log-likelihood with task alignment using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels, aligning small proxies with both pre-training objectives and target reasoning tasks.

Result: rBridge reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x, achieves strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B-32B scale, and zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B-7B scale.

Conclusion: rBridge provides a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost by enabling small proxy models to effectively predict large-model reasoning performance.

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

*Zhengyuan Shi,Jingxin Wang,Wentao Jiang,Chengyu Ma,Ziyang Zheng,Zhufei Chu,Weikang Qian,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MixGate introduces a framework for multiview learning on Boolean circuits that first aligns different circuit representations functionally before applying masked modeling, overcoming structural heterogeneity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different graph-based representations of Boolean circuits offer complementary information but structural heterogeneity between views (like AIG vs XMG) makes fusion difficult, especially for self-supervised methods where cross-view context appears as noise.

Method: Uses a training curriculum with Equivalence Alignment Loss to first teach a shared function-aware representation space, then introduces multiview masked modeling to leverage the aligned views as complementary signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show the alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from ineffective to powerful performance driver, with ablation studies confirming the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Functional alignment is a necessary precondition for effective multiview self-supervision on Boolean circuits, enabling masked modeling to work successfully across heterogeneous circuit representations.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

### [108] [Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021)
*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-CIT is a plug-and-play framework that reduces computational cost of conditional independence tests for causal discovery by partitioning data into subsets, applying base CITs, and aggregating p-values using stable distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence tests, but faces prohibitive computational costs due to high time complexity of CITs with respect to sample size.

Method: Divide-and-aggregate strategy: partition data into subsets, apply base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregate resulting p-values using novel method based on stable distributions.

Result: Reduces computational complexity to linear in sample size when subset size is fixed. Achieves competitive performance with significant computational burden reduction, showing improvement in complex testing scenarios on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: E-CIT framework effectively addresses computational bottleneck in causal discovery while maintaining competitive performance, particularly benefiting complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

### [109] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044)
*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning enhances LLMs by increasing activation intensity and diversity, making information flow more redundant and flexible, which improves generalization. DPO shows weaker internal changes compared to PPO/GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why RL fine-tuning improves LLM capabilities beyond SFT alone, and investigate the internal mechanisms that differ across various LLM families after RL training.

Method: Used edge attribution patching (EAP) to analyze internal differences in LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning across multiple model families, comparing PPO, GRPO, and DPO approaches.

Result: Found two robust effects: (1) increased activation intensity showing more engaged pathways, (2) greater diversity in activation patterns with higher entropy and less concentrated distributions. DPO showed substantially weaker internal changes.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning systematically alters LLM internal circuitry by making information flow more redundant and flexible, explaining its generalization advantage. Online RL (PPO/GRPO) differs methodologically from preference-based approaches like DPO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

### [110] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLUE is a framework that uses circuit discovery to precisely identify and separate neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge versus retaining essential skills in LLM unlearning, enabling targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current localization-based unlearning methods treat neurons as an entangled group, leading to uniform interventions that risk catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of target knowledge.

Method: Uses circuit discovery to identify forget and retain circuits, transforms them into conjunctive normal forms (CNF), analyzes neuron assignments in CNF satisfiability solutions, and applies targeted fine-tuning strategies for different neuron categories.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility compared to existing localization methods through precise neural localization.

Conclusion: CLUE framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing unlearning methods by precisely disentangling and targeting specific neurons for forgetting and retention.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

*Bing Liu,Wenqiang Yv,Xuzheng Yang,Shichang Wang,Junzhuo Liu,Peng Wang,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoRef, a benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) in geometric problems, which tests models' ability to localize geometric elements based on natural language queries. It addresses the lack of annotated data through synthetic dataset generation and shows that GRPO fine-tuning outperforms SFT, with additional improvements from a verify-and-regenerate mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven geometric problem solving requires accurate diagram interpretation and cross-modal grounding, but current models struggle with identifying geometric elements from natural language queries. This gap motivates the development of a specialized REC task for geometry.

Method: Created GeoRef benchmark from existing geometric corpora with diverse annotations. Generated large-scale synthetic training data using structured geometric formal language. Explored SFT and GRPO fine-tuning approaches, and implemented a verify-and-regenerate mechanism for error correction.

Result: GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning with task-specific rewards. The verify-and-regenerate mechanism further boosts accuracy. Even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with this task, but models trained on GeoRef show measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit evaluation and strengthening of geometric grounding is essential for robust geometric problem solving. REC serves as a foundational capability for multimodal mathematical understanding, and GeoRef-trained models demonstrate broader value in improving geometric reasoning performance.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

*Qizhi Pei,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Xin Gao,Yu Li,Zinan Tang,Conghui He,Rui Yan,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a pipeline that efficiently identifies difficult math problems from existing datasets and trains a specialized generator to create new difficult problems at scale, eliminating the need for expensive API calls and complex prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for automated synthesis of mathematical problems face challenges with high computational/API costs, complex prompting, and limited difficulty levels of generated problems, making scaling difficult.

Method: Use adaptive thinking model to identify difficult problems with single forward pass, then train DiffGen-8B generator on filtered difficult data to produce new problems at scale without complex prompting.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields 11.3% performance increase and 65.9% average accuracy on multiple benchmarks, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively transfers advanced reasoning capabilities using cost-efficient models, demonstrates scaling phenomenon with increased difficult problems, and provides a practical solution for scaling difficult problem generation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LCR is a practical learning-based GPU caching framework that enhances LRU with machine learning predictions while maintaining robustness through online error estimation, achieving significant performance improvements in recommendation models and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cache efficiency is a major bottleneck in GPU inference, with heuristic policies like LRU struggling under structured access patterns, and existing learning-based approaches facing limitations in robustness and practicality.

Method: LCR uses LARU algorithm that enhances LRU with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation, ensuring graceful degradation when predictions are inaccurate.

Result: LCR improves throughput by up to 24.2% in DLRM scenarios and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3% in LLM scenarios, outperforming widely used inference systems while maintaining stable performance even under poor predictions.

Conclusion: LCR successfully bridges the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching, delivering consistent performance gains with practical robustness in real-world GPU inference scenarios.

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

### [114] [TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21081)
*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA is a hybrid attention kernel that combines naive and absorb formulations to improve performance in MLA-based LLMs, achieving up to 3.24x throughput improvement with minimal HBM overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLA decoding kernels use absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth but miss data reuse opportunities like shared prefixes, while naive kernels are efficient but not used in decoding.

Method: Hybrid approach combining naive formulation for compute-bound parts (to leverage shared prefixes) and absorb formulation for non-shared parts (to reduce bandwidth requirements).

Result: Achieves up to 3x and 3.24x throughput improvement on NPU and GPUs respectively, with only 3% HBM size overhead.

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA effectively balances computational efficiency and bandwidth optimization in MLA architectures, significantly improving decoding performance.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

### [115] [Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20993)
*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient estimator for the inverse temperature parameter of truncated Ising models using a single sample, achieving consistency in nearly linear time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging problem of estimating the inverse temperature parameter in truncated Ising models, which are constrained by k-SAT formulas, using only a single sample from the distribution.

Method: The estimator is based on maximizing the pseudolikelihood function, generalizing recent techniques from related works to handle the more complex truncated Ising model setting.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves O(Δ³/√n)-consistency with the true parameter β* in nearly O(n) time, requiring k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops an efficient and consistent estimator for truncated Ising model parameters using pseudolikelihood maximization, extending previous approaches to handle the additional complexity of truncation constraints.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

### [116] [GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097)
*Louis Van Langendonck,Guillermo Bernárdez,Nina Miolane,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphUniverse is a framework for generating graph families to systematically evaluate inductive generalization, revealing that transductive performance poorly predicts inductive generalization and robustness varies significantly with architecture and graph properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating graph learning models' generalization to unseen graphs, as existing benchmarks are limited to single-graph transductive settings.

Method: Generate graphs with persistent semantic communities while controlling structural properties like homophily and degree distributions, enabling systematic evaluation of inductive generalization and robustness under distribution shifts.

Result: Benchmarking various architectures shows transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization, and robustness to distribution shift depends on both model architecture and initial graph properties.

Conclusion: GraphUniverse enables systematic evaluation of inductive generalization and can facilitate development of robust, generalizable graph architectures including foundation models.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

### [117] [Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21126)
*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VARL uses vision-language models as action advisors to improve sample efficiency in online reinforcement learning, providing action suggestions instead of reward shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online RL is time-consuming due to massive interaction needs, and VLA policies have limited low-level control performance requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Leverage VLMs' domain knowledge to provide action suggestions for RL agents, increasing sample diversity without changing optimality or convergence guarantees.

Result: VARL greatly improves sample efficiency across diverse environments and agent settings without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: VARL is a general framework that makes RL feasible from scratch in real-world environments by improving sample efficiency through VLM-guided action suggestions.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

### [118] [Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21000)
*Qingyu Han,Qian Li,Linxin Yang,Qian Chen,Qingjiang Shi,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Local-UID, a parsimonious identifier scheme for GNNs in ILP optimization that ensures uniqueness only within local neighborhoods, addressing the generalization issues of global UIDs while maintaining expressive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard anonymous GNNs lack expressiveness for ILPs, while global unique identifiers introduce spurious correlations that harm generalization, creating a tradeoff that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes Local-UID based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, with ColorGNN (color-conditioned embeddings) and ColorUID (lightweight feature-level variant) implementations.

Result: The approach achieves expressive power of Global-UIDs with stronger generalization, shows substantial gains on ILP benchmarks, strong OOD generalization on LP datasets, and improves graph-level tasks when combined with SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Local-UID scheme successfully addresses the expressiveness-generalization tradeoff in GNNs for ILP optimization, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

### [119] [LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21149)
*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAVA is a post-hoc model-agnostic method that explains local embedding organization in unsupervised learning by identifying recurring patterns of feature correlations across latent space neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised explainability methods provide either too fine-grained or too reductive explanations, lacking automated strategies to relate similar samples based on latent proximity, especially for manifold learning methods that only provide relative spatial organization of embeddings.

Method: LAVA represents the latent space as neighborhoods and describes them in terms of correlations between original features, then identifies recurring patterns of these correlations across the entire latent space.

Result: LAVA captures relevant feature associations with visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly distant regions of latent spaces, demonstrated on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and single-cell kidney datasets.

Conclusion: LAVA provides meaningful explanations of local embedding organization by relating input features to latent space structure through recurring correlation patterns, addressing limitations of existing unsupervised explainability methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

### [120] [GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21154)
*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that GRPO RL algorithm induces a hidden process reward model (PRM) and identifies a flaw in its objective related to non-uniform process step distribution. The authors propose λ-GRPO modification that improves performance over standard GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether GRPO algorithm inherently creates a process reward model and to address performance limitations caused by non-uniform process step distribution in the GRPO objective.

Method: Theoretical proof that GRPO induces a non-trivial PRM under certain assumptions, empirical validation of these assumptions, identification of GRPO objective flaws, and proposal of λ-GRPO modification to mitigate the issues.

Result: Empirical validation shows GRPO does induce a non-trivial PRM. λ-GRPO achieves higher validation accuracy and downstream reasoning performance, reaching peak performance faster than standard GRPO with negligible training time/cost impact.

Conclusion: The built-in PRM structure in vanilla GRPO can be leveraged to boost performance, questioning the need for costly explicit PRMs. λ-GRPO effectively addresses GRPO's exploration/exploitation issues.

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

*Seokbin Yoon,Keumjin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAIFormer is a novel neural architecture using masked multivariate attention and agent attention modules to predict multi-agent flight trajectories, achieving state-of-the-art performance with interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential but challenging due to difficulties in modeling individual aircraft behaviors over time and complex interactions between flights, as well as generating explainable prediction outcomes.

Method: Proposed Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer (MAIFormer) with two key attention modules: (1) masked multivariate attention for capturing spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (2) agent attention for modeling social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes.

Result: MAIFormer achieved the best performance across multiple metrics on a real-world ADS-B flight trajectory dataset from Incheon International Airport, outperforming other methods and producing interpretable prediction outcomes.

Conclusion: MAIFormer improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control by providing interpretable predictions while achieving superior performance in multi-agent flight trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

### [122] [Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190)
*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRCD is a novel foundation model for time series anomaly detection that uses Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) instead of reconstruction, enabling better zero-shot performance by detecting discrepancies between adjacent time windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction-based foundation models for TSAD suffer from objective mismatch - they struggle with subtle anomalies and misinterpret complex normal patterns, leading to high false positive/negative rates.

Method: Uses Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) paradigm where the model is trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows, implemented with standard Transformer architecture and pre-trained on large-scale synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show TimeRCD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The RCD paradigm establishes a new effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection, overcoming limitations of reconstruction-based approaches.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

*Yuxiang Ji,Ziyu Ma,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Xiangxiang Chu,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tree-GRPO is a tree-based grouped agent RL method that addresses sparse supervision in long-term multi-turn agent tasks by using tree search to generate more rollouts and create step-wise process supervision from outcome rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for LLM agents driven solely by outcome rewards suffer from sparse supervision in long-term multi-turn tasks, limiting learning efficiency.

Method: Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO) uses tree search where each node represents an agent interaction step, shares common prefixes to increase rollouts, and estimates grouped relative advantages at intra-tree and inter-tree levels.

Result: Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate superiority over chain-based RL methods.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO effectively addresses sparse supervision in agent RL through tree-structured trajectory processing and relative advantage estimation, providing better performance than traditional chain-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

TL;DR: A framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs using counterfactuals from knowledge graphs, revealing how LoRA fine-tuning alters model reasoning through minimal structural perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning changes LLMs' structural reasoning and semantic behavior, which remains poorly understood despite widespread adoption.

Method: Construct BioToolKG (bioinformatics knowledge graph) and design CFFTLLMExplainer that learns soft masks over graph nodes/edges to generate minimal structural perturbations causing maximum semantic divergence, with joint optimization of structural sparsity and semantic divergence.

Result: Applied to fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM, counterfactual masking exposes model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.

Conclusion: Provides insights into fine-tuned LLMs' internal mechanisms and demonstrates counterfactual graphs as a tool for interpretable AI.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

*Junxin Lu,Shiliang Sun*

TL;DR: AirPCM is a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling for accurate air pollution forecasting across distributed monitoring stations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution is a pressing global problem threatening public health and environmental sustainability. Current forecasting methods are limited by complex multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and spatial heterogeneity across regions.

Method: AirPCM uses a unified deep learning architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality, enabling multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales.

Result: Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets show AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability, including handling sudden pollution episodes.

Conclusion: AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning through its long-term forecasting capability.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTA-Code is a synthetic coding benchmark that tests whether LLMs can learn new reasoning strategies through RL and transfer them to out-of-distribution problems, revealing grokking phase transitions and systematic transfer patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate about whether LLMs can genuinely acquire new reasoning strategies beyond their pre-trained capabilities, particularly in algorithmic coding tasks where current models fail.

Method: Created DELTA-Code benchmark with synthetic coding problem families using templated generators, employed RL training with techniques like staged warm-up, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop.

Result: Models showed striking grokking phase transitions - extended near-zero reward periods followed by abrupt near-perfect accuracy. Solid gains within families and recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases.

Conclusion: DELTA provides a clean testbed for probing RL-driven reasoning limits and understanding how models can acquire new algorithmic skills beyond existing priors.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

### [127] [It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282)
*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSPO is a new RL method that smooths policy probabilities instead of clipping ratios, improving stability while preserving gradient information and boosting performance by over 20% on GSM8K compared to clipped GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like PPO and GRPO use ratio clipping to stabilize updates, but this discards information and creates gradient discontinuities. PSPO aims to provide stable updates without these drawbacks.

Method: PSPO smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old policy before computing importance ratios, creating a soft trust region that prevents large updates while maintaining gradient continuity.

Result: GR-PSPO achieved 39.7% vs 17.6% for 0.5B model and 59.4% vs 37.8% for 1.5B model on GSM8K compared to clipped GRPO, representing over 20% performance improvement. It also produced clearer, more logical reasoning.

Conclusion: PSPO provides formal guarantees for stable updates while preserving gradient information, substantially outperforming clipped methods and improving reasoning quality in language models.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

*Yehonatan Refael,Guy Smorodinsky,Ofir Lindenbaum,Itay Safran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training data reconstruction from neural networks is fundamentally unreliable without prior knowledge, as there exist infinitely many alternative solutions far from the true data. Networks trained more extensively are actually less susceptible to reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing training data reconstruction methods, and identify conditions under which they fail, rather than designing stronger attacks.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving that without prior knowledge about the data, there are infinitely many alternative solutions arbitrarily far from the true training set. Empirical demonstration that exact duplication occurs only by chance.

Result: Reconstruction is fundamentally unreliable without incorporating prior knowledge. Networks trained more extensively (satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly) are actually less susceptible to reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: The work refines theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offers insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization.

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACA eliminates the explicit actor network in actor-critic methods by generating actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic, achieving competitive performance with simpler architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard actor-critic methods rely on separate actor and critic networks, making training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter tuning, while diffusion models introduce additional design complexity and computational burden.

Method: Introduces Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA) framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic, removing actor training overhead.

Result: ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods on standard online RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACA provides a simple yet powerful solution for online RL that combines simplicity with expressiveness, capturing diverse multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes visual jailbreaking attacks on multimodal large language models (MLLMs), finding they have limited cross-model transferability due to high-sharpness regions. The authors propose FORCE method to improve transferability by correcting feature over-reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual jailbreaking attacks can easily manipulate open-source MLLMs but fail to transfer to closed-source models, limiting vulnerability assessment capabilities.

Method: Analyzed loss landscape and feature representations, then proposed FORCE method that guides attacks to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales frequency feature influence based on semantic content.

Result: FORCE method successfully discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, significantly improving cross-model transferability for red-teaming evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the transferability limitations of visual jailbreaking attacks, enabling better vulnerability assessment of closed-source MLLMs through corrected feature reliance.

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build efficient learning systems that reach desired error thresholds with minimal observations, drawing inspiration from physics principles.

learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the

in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPREAD is a generative framework using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for efficient multi-objective optimization, combining adaptive gradient descent updates with diversity mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods for large-scale and expensive problems, particularly for computing Pareto sets of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives.

Method: SPREAD uses conditional diffusion processes over decision space points, with reverse diffusion steps that refine candidates using adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired updates for convergence and Gaussian RBF-based repulsion for diversity.

Result: Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks show SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage in both offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings.

Conclusion: SPREAD provides an effective generative framework for multi-objective optimization that achieves competitive performance across various benchmark settings.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

*Zhen Liu,Yongtao Zhang,Shaobo Ren,Yuxin You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SATMC is a novel graph domain adaptation framework that addresses structural heterogeneity by sequentially aligning distributions through both graph structure and attribute transformations, achieving superior cross-network node classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph domain adaptation methods focus mainly on node attribute transformation and alignment, but struggle with structural heterogeneity between different graph domains, leading to suboptimal distribution alignment.

Method: SATMC uses sequential distribution alignment via both graph structure and attribute transformations, introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism, and employs empirical Wasserstein distance to enhance generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on nine pairs of cross-domain datasets show SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-network node classification tasks.

Conclusion: SATMC provides a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification and effectively addresses structural heterogeneity in graph domain adaptation through its novel structure-attribute transformation approach.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

### [134] [EvoMail: Self-Evolving Cognitive Agents for Adaptive Spam and Phishing Email Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21129)
*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail is a self-evolving cognitive agent framework that uses heterogeneous email graphs and adversarial self-evolution to detect modern spam and phishing attacks, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved beyond simple keyword filters, using multi-modal campaigns with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments that adapt quickly to bypass traditional detection systems.

Method: EvoMail constructs unified heterogeneous email graphs fusing text, metadata, and embedded resources. It uses a Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by LLM for context-aware reasoning, and features an adversarial self-evolution loop with red-team agents generating evasion tactics and blue-team detectors learning from failures.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants show EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving tactics, and interpretability.

Conclusion: EvoMail demonstrates potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats through its self-evolving cognitive architecture.

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using sparse PCA (SPCA) as a defense against adversarial attacks, showing it provides better robustness than standard PCA while maintaining competitive clean accuracy, with theoretical analysis explaining why sparser projections reduce adversarial vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and the paper aims to explore simple, data-adapted defenses using linear dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: The study empirically compares standard PCA with sparse PCA (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors, and provides theoretical analysis including robustness certificates for linear heads and Lipschitz composition arguments for non-linear heads.

Result: SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy, with theoretical analysis confirming that sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage.

Conclusion: Sparse PCA provides an effective defense mechanism against adversarial attacks by reducing input sensitivity through sparser projections, with benefits persisting beyond linear settings.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

*Ruiyu Wang,Shizhao Sun,Weijian Ma,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAD-Tokenizer is a multimodal tokenization framework that represents CAD sequences with primitive-aware tokens, enabling better text-guided CAD prototyping by capturing geometric structure that standard LLM tokenizers miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure, which limits text-guided CAD prototyping capabilities.

Method: Proposed CAD-Tokenizer framework using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding to represent CAD data with modality-specific tokens that align with CAD's structural nature.

Result: CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality in unified text-guided CAD prototyping, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: A multimodal tokenization strategy aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature provides more effective representations for text-guided CAD prototyping, overcoming limitations of standard LLM tokenizers.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

### [137] [DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21161)
*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DATS, a distance-aware temperature scaling method for continual learning that adapts calibration temperatures based on task proximity without requiring task information at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning approaches use single temperature scaling across all tasks, ignoring task-specific differences and causing large calibration error fluctuations. Safety-critical applications require reliable uncertainty communication through calibrated confidence scores.

Method: DATS combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information.

Result: Extensive evaluation on standard benchmarks and biomedical datasets shows DATS is stable, reliable and consistent in reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Distance-aware temperature scaling effectively addresses calibration issues in continual learning by adapting to task-specific differences without requiring task information during deployment.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Jacob Fein-Ashley,Dhruv Parikh,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT is a method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous LLMs using a lightweight router and interaction layers in shared latent space, achieving state-of-the-art performance with single-pass inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-LLM approaches have limitations: routing to single experts loses complementary strengths, multi-turn aggregation is costly, and weight fusion requires architectural homogeneity. There's a need for efficient collaboration among specialized LLMs.

Method: Uses lightweight router to select top-K experts and designate primary expert. Interaction layers project hidden states into shared latent space where primary expert performs cross-attention over selected peers. Only router and interaction layers are trained with joint objective.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art Avengers by +0.38% on ID and +2.92% on OOD benchmarks. Significantly outperforms best single model. Achieves this with single-pass inference and runtime comparable to routing baselines.

Conclusion: MoT provides a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, representing a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration with efficient inference.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

*Nicola Novello,Federico Fontana,Luigi Cinque,Deniz Gunduz,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified f-divergence framework for machine unlearning in diffusion models, showing that existing MSE-based approaches are a special case and offering flexibility to choose optimal divergences for different trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for text-to-image models rely on minimizing MSE between output distributions, but this approach has limitations and lacks flexibility for different application requirements.

Method: Proposes a unified f-divergence-based framework where any f-divergence can be used instead of just MSE, allowing selection of optimal divergence for specific applications.

Result: Shows that MSE-based approach is a special case of the unified framework, and different f-divergences impact convergence properties and unlearning quality, enabling better trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Conclusion: The unified f-divergence framework provides a flexible paradigm for machine unlearning in diffusion models, allowing practitioners to select the most suitable divergence for their specific application needs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

### [140] [Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a simplified approach to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) that reduces the problem to two supervised learning tasks: probabilistic classification to estimate behavior policy and iterative regression to solve a linear fixed-point equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IRL methods involve complex inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, which complicate the use of modern expressive function approximators like neural networks.

Method: The authors show that softmax IRL's population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This reduces IRL to two supervised learning problems: behavior policy estimation via classification and solving the fixed point via iterative regression.

Result: The proposed method is simple, modular across function approximation classes, and shows competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: This work provides a more accessible and practical approach to IRL that leverages standard supervised learning techniques while maintaining theoretical guarantees and competitive performance.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

### [141] [Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified characterization of parameter norm scaling for overparameterized linear regression with minimum-ℓp interpolators (p∈(1,2]), revealing a data-dependent transition point (elbow) and universal threshold r⋆=2(p-1) that separates saturating vs. growing norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different ℓr norms of minimum-ℓp interpolators scale with sample size in overparameterized linear regression, which is fundamental but previously unresolved, and to bridge explicit and implicit bias in deep learning.

Method: Uses dual-ray analysis to reveal competition between signal spike and null coordinate bulk in X⊤Y, yielding closed-form predictions for transition points. Then studies diagonal linear networks trained by gradient descent, calibrating initialization scale to effective p via separable potential.

Result: Identified data-dependent transition n⋆ (elbow) and universal threshold r⋆=2(p-1) that separates ℓr norms that plateau from those that grow. Shows DLNs inherit same scaling laws, providing predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.

Conclusion: The unified solution explains scaling of all ℓr norms within r∈[1,p] under ℓp-biased interpolation. Since many generalization proxies depend on ∥ŵp∥r, their predictive power depends sensitively on which ℓr norm is used.

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

### [142] [Differential-Integral Neural Operator for Long-Term Turbulence Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21196)
*Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Fan Xu,Fan Zhang,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xiaomeng Huang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DINO is a novel neural operator framework that decomposes turbulent dynamics into local differential and global integral operators, enabling stable long-term turbulence forecasting by addressing error accumulation and maintaining physical fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods fail in long-term turbulence forecasting due to catastrophic error accumulation and loss of physical fidelity, stemming from their inability to capture both local dissipative effects and global non-local interactions simultaneously.

Method: DINO uses a physics-based operator decomposition with parallel branches: a local differential operator implemented as a constrained convolutional network that converges to derivatives, and a global integral operator captured by a Transformer architecture learning data-driven global kernels.

Result: DINO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting on 2D Kolmogorov flow, suppressing error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps while maintaining high fidelity in vorticity fields and energy spectra.

Conclusion: DINO establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecasting by explicitly modeling the distinct mathematical structures governing turbulent dynamics through principled operator decomposition.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This review paper examines physics-informed machine learning approaches for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), focusing on how learning and observational biases can improve model reliability and enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world PHM faces challenges including noisy/incomplete sensor data, limited labels, and complex nonlinear degradation behaviors. Physics-informed machine learning addresses these limitations by embedding physical knowledge into data-driven models.

Method: The review examines two main approaches: learning biases (embedding physical constraints through physics-informed loss functions, governing equations, and monotonicity properties) and observational biases (influencing data selection through virtual sensing, physics-based simulation for data augmentation, and multi-sensor fusion).

Result: These approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing operational objectives.

Conclusion: The review addresses scaling PHM solutions from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment using fast adaptation methods like meta-learning, few-shot learning, and domain generalization techniques, closing the loop between model-based predictions, simulation, and actual system operation.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

*Nikolay Blagoev,Bart Cox,Jérémie Decouchant,Lydia Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GWTF is the first crash-tolerant decentralized training framework for LLMs that enables efficient collaborative training on volunteer heterogeneous clients while handling node churn and network instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of large language models and the importance of democratizing their training motivated the development of a decentralized framework that can handle real-world challenges like node churn and network instabilities.

Method: GWTF uses a novel decentralized flow algorithm that finds the most effective routing to maximize the number of microbatches trained with minimal delay, enabling collaborative training on heterogeneous clients.

Result: GWTF reduces training time by up to 45% in realistic scenarios involving heterogeneous client nodes distributed over 10 geographic locations with high node churn rates.

Conclusion: GWTF provides a practical and efficient solution for decentralized LLM training that outperforms prior art by significantly reducing training time while handling real-world deployment challenges.

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

*Zifan Wang,Anqi Dong,Mahmoud Selim,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FFM enables privacy-preserving training of flow matching models on decentralized data without central aggregation, with three variants: FFM-vanilla (privacy-preserving but slow), FFM-LOT (improved straightness but lacks global consistency), and FFM-GOT (best performance using global optimal transport coordination).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data is decentralized across devices and institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization, creating the need to train generative models directly from distributed data locally without central aggregation.

Method: Three federated flow matching approaches: FFM-vanilla (local training with independent couplings), FFM-LOT (local optimal transport couplings), and FFM-GOT (federated strategy using semi-dual optimal transport with shared global potential function).

Result: Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing flow straightness and sample quality, with performance comparable to centralized baseline.

Conclusion: FFM framework successfully trains flow matching models under privacy constraints, with FFM-GOT providing the best balance of privacy preservation, flow straightness, and sample quality in federated settings.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SuperOffload is a novel offloading system for Superchips that optimizes LLM training by efficiently utilizing GPU, CPU, and interconnect resources, achieving 2.5x throughput improvement and enabling training of up to 25B models on a single Superchip.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of Superchips with tightly coupled GPU-CPU architecture offers unprecedented computational power, but there's limited research on how LLM training benefits from this new architecture, requiring revisiting traditional offloading assumptions.

Method: SuperOffload uses adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs, combined with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism.

Result: Evaluation on NVIDIA GH200 shows 2.5x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art offloading systems, enabling training of 25B models on single Superchip and 13B models with 1M token sequences on 8 GH200 with 55% MFU.

Conclusion: SuperOffload demonstrates that Superchips can significantly accelerate LLM training through efficient resource utilization and specialized optimization techniques, overcoming limitations of traditional loosely-coupled architectures.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

### [148] [Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293)
*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new algorithm for computing optimal robust recourse in algorithmic decision-making systems that is resilient to model updates, using L^p norms instead of L^∞ norm to achieve lower-cost recourses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust recourse methods using L^∞ norm can lead to high-cost recourses, and existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees for optimality. The authors aim to address these limitations by considering more constrained model changes.

Method: The authors develop a new algorithm that provably computes optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models using L^p norms (p≥1, p≠∞) instead of L^∞ norm, and validate it empirically on both linear and non-linear models.

Result: Empirical results show the algorithm achieves significantly lower recourse costs (up to several orders of magnitude), better trade-off between implementation cost and validity, more sparse recourses, and resilience to post-processing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed L^p norm-based robust recourse algorithm provides more practical and cost-effective solutions compared to prior L^∞ norm approaches, with theoretical guarantees and improved empirical performance.

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Graham Alexander Watt,Yuri Leonenko,Juan Moreno-Cruz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ECHO-MIMIC is a computational framework that transforms collective action problems from ill-structured to well-structured problems by discovering executable behavioral heuristics and persuasive rationales through LLM-driven evolutionary search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collective action problems are ill-structured because individual agents cannot clearly see how their local actions affect global outcomes, stakeholder objectives conflict, and no single algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare.

Method: Two-stage framework: ECHO evolves Python code snippets for behavioral policies, while MIMIC evolves natural language messages to motivate adoption. Both use LLM-driven evolutionary search where the LLM proposes variants and selection retains those maximizing collective performance in simulation.

Result: Demonstrated on agricultural landscape management, ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals.

Conclusion: ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into simple agent-level instructions, making ill-structured problems solvable and opening new paths for scalable, adaptive policy design.

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

TL;DR: RadAgents is a multi-agent framework for chest X-ray interpretation that addresses limitations in clinical interpretability, multimodal fusion, and inconsistency detection through clinical priors, task-aware reasoning, and verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic systems for CXR interpretation lack clinically interpretable reasoning aligned with guidelines, insufficiently fuse multimodal evidence, and fail to detect cross-tool inconsistencies without proper verification mechanisms.

Method: Multi-agent framework that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning, integrating grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts.

Result: The system produces outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice by addressing the identified gaps in existing methods.

Conclusion: RadAgents successfully bridges the gaps in current CXR interpretation systems by providing clinically aligned, multimodal reasoning with built-in verification mechanisms for improved reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.
