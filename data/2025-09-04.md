TL;DR: Media coverage can foster AI safety by creating reputation consequences for developers, but only when information quality is reliable and costs are manageable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI developers often prioritize profit over safety, requiring tangible negative consequences to incentivize trustworthy AI production.

Method: Used evolutionary game theory with artificial populations of self-interested creators and users to study media's impact on cooperation.

Result: Media can foster cooperation between creators and users, but fails when information quality is unreliable or costs (media access/safety implementation) are too high.

Conclusion: Media serves as a powerful soft regulator for AI safety by shaping public perception and holding developers accountable, even without formal government oversight.

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

### [2] [Deep Research is the New Analytics System: Towards Building the Runtime for AI-Driven Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02751)
*Matthew Russo,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A prototype system that combines Deep Research agents with optimized semantic operators to achieve better performance and cost efficiency in AI-driven analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic operators are expensive for large datasets and ill-suited for interactive analytics, while Deep Research systems lack query optimization. A hybrid approach is needed to combine optimized execution with dynamic flexibility.

Method: Built a prototype that enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic operator programs, combining the strengths of both approaches.

Result: The prototype outperformed handcrafted semantic operator programs and open Deep Research systems, achieving up to 1.95x better F1-score and cost/runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7%.

Conclusion: Combining Deep Research agents with optimized semantic operators provides a promising direction for efficient AI-driven analytics, offering both performance improvements and cost savings.

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

### [4] [Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02722)
*Delong Chen,Theo Moutakanni,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Allen Bolourchi,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLWM is a vision-language foundation model for world modeling that combines action policy learning with dynamics modeling, using LLM self-refinement and semantic cost minimization to achieve state-of-the-art visual planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level world models capable of understanding actions with semantic and temporal abstraction are underdeveloped, limiting effective planning capabilities.

Method: Uses vision-language modeling on natural videos, infers goal achievements from visual observations, predicts action-state trajectories via LLM self-refinement with Tree of Captions, and employs both system-1 reactive decoding and system-2 reflective planning through semantic cost minimization.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on Visual Planning for Assistance benchmarks and PlannerArena human evaluations (system-2 improves Elo score by +27%), and outperforms VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: VLWM successfully integrates language-based world modeling with semantic reasoning, demonstrating significant improvements in visual planning tasks through the combination of reactive and reflective planning systems.

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

### [5] [Do LLM Modules Generalize? A Study on Motion Generation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02754)
*Mingyi Wang,Jingke Wang,Tengju Ye,Junbo Chen,Kaicheng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of transferring 5 key LLM modules to autonomous driving motion generation, showing significant performance improvements when properly adapted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown success in NLP and structurally similar domains like autonomous driving motion generation, but there's lack of systematic understanding about which LLM modules are truly transferable.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of five LLM modules: tokenizer design, positional embedding, pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time computation, adapted for autonomous driving motion generation using Waymo Sim Agents benchmark.

Result: When appropriately adapted, these modules significantly improve performance for autonomous driving motion generation, achieving competitive results on the Sim Agents task.

Conclusion: The study identifies which LLM techniques can be effectively transferred to autonomous driving, analyzes reasons for failures, and discusses necessary adaptations for driving scenarios.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

### [6] [Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761)
*Ananth Hariharan,Vardhan Dongre,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An iterative LLM verification framework that critiques and refines noisy action plans for embodied AI, achieving high precision and recall while preserving human error-recovery patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based task plans and human demonstrations in embodied AI often contain noisy actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality and training data effectiveness.

Method: Proposes an iterative verification framework with a Judge LLM that critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM that applies revisions, using natural language prompting for broad generalization across error types.

Result: Achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision on TEACh dataset across four state-of-the-art LLMs, with 96.5% of sequences converging in ≤3 iterations while improving temporal efficiency and spatial organization.

Conclusion: Establishes plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning, providing a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI while preserving human error-recovery patterns.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

### [7] [Key Principles in Cross-Domain Hyper-Heuristic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02782)
*Václav Sobotka,Lucas Kletzander,Nysret Musliu,Hana Rudová*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Strategic transformations of low-level heuristic sets enable trivial random selection to outperform state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics and find new best-known solutions across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selection hyper-heuristics focus on adaptive selection from predefined heuristic sets, but lack systematic analysis of set composition and strategic transformations to improve performance.

Method: Systematically analyze transformations based on solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation intensity. Test transformations with trivial random selection and apply them to recent hyper-heuristics.

Result: Transformed trivial random selection outperforms all state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics on real-world domains, finds 11 new best-known solutions, and competes with CHeSC competition winner. Enhanced hyper-heuristics outperform current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Strategic transformations of low-level heuristic sets significantly improve hyper-heuristic performance, often simplifying designs while achieving superior results across challenging domains.

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

### [8] [Learning General Policies From Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02794)
*Blai Bonet,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new symbolic method for learning general policies using hitting set algorithm instead of SAT/ASP, enabling scalability to millions of states and hundreds of thousands of features while ensuring structural termination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous combinatorial methods for learning general policies don't scale well, limited to small training instances with few hundreds of states and features, while deep learning approaches lack interpretability and correctness guarantees.

Method: Proposes a symbolic method based on generalization of sampled plans using a hitting set algorithm that ensures structural termination and acyclicity, replacing previous SAT/ASP approaches.

Result: The method can effectively handle problems with millions of states and feature pools with hundreds of thousands of features, demonstrating significant scalability improvements.

Conclusion: The hitting set-based approach provides a scalable symbolic method for learning general policies that maintains interpretability and correctness guarantees while handling much larger problem instances than previous combinatorial methods.

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

### [9] [Uncertainty-driven Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03219)
*Leonidas Bakopoulos,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A generic adaptive exploration framework that uses uncertainty to determine optimal switching between exploration and exploitation phases in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of determining when to switch between exploration and exploitation in complex domains requiring long action sequences.

Method: Proposes a framework that employs uncertainty measures (from intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty methods) to guide exploration-exploitation switching in a principled manner.

Result: Outperforms standard adaptive exploration strategies across multiple MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-based framework provides a principled approach for adaptive exploration that generalizes previous methods and enables flexible incorporation of various uncertainty measurement mechanisms.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

### [10] [Accountability Framework for Healthcare AI Systems: Towards Joint Accountability in Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03286)
*Prachi Bagave,Marcus Westberg,Marijn Janssen,Aaron Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the accountability gap in AI healthcare systems by developing a framework and three-tier structure to bridge regulatory guidelines with practical implementation, emphasizing shared responsibility and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI is increasingly used in critical healthcare decisions, but regulatory guidelines are high-level and lack practical implementation details, creating ambiguity around accountability that needs to be addressed.

Method: The authors conducted extensive analysis of accountability concepts, formulated an accountability framework, and created a three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms in healthcare AI systems.

Result: Developed an accountability framework that positions healthcare AI regulations and actor mechanisms under a consistent regime, with a three-tier structure to categorize mechanisms based on conduct.

Conclusion: Healthcare AI decision-making requires shared accountability handled jointly through collaboration, with explainability playing a crucial role in facilitating communication and information sharing between actors.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: app.build is an open-source framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic validation and structured environments, achieving 73.3% viability rate and showing open-weights models can reach 80.8% of closed-model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling reliable AI agents by focusing on improving environments and validation systems rather than just scaling models, enabling more robust application generation.

Method: Combines multi-layered validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic architecture across three reference stacks, with systematic evaluation on 30 generation tasks.

Result: Achieved 73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores; open-weights models achieved 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided structured environments; framework adopted by community with over 3,000 applications generated.

Conclusion: Scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not just models - the framework provides empirical insights and complete reference implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

### [12] [Language Models Do Not Follow Occam's Razor: A Benchmark for Inductive and Abductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03345)
*Yunxin Sun,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities using a synthetic dataset called InAbHyD, finding that while LLMs can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most work on LLM reasoning focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, while inductive and abductive reasoning are essential for real-world problem solving but remain less explored.

Method: Created a programmable synthetic dataset (InAbHyD) with incomplete world models and observations, proposed a new metric based on Occam's Razor to evaluate hypothesis quality, and tested state-of-the-art LLMs including with reasoning-enhancing techniques like in-context learning and RLVR.

Result: LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in handling complex inductive and abductive reasoning tasks, indicating the need for further research and improvement in these reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

*Peter J. Bentley,Soo Ling Lim,Fuyuki Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bottom-up framework for AI agents that uses environmental triggers and specialized perception aspects to prevent information leakage, achieving zero leakage compared to 83% in typical architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic LLM AI agents often function as autonomous chatbots following scripts with unreliable control, leading to significant information leakage problems.

Method: Introduces a bottom-up framework where AI agents are situated in their environment with behaviors triggered by environmental changes. Uses the concept of 'aspects' (similar to umwelt) where different agent sets perceive environments differently for clearer information control.

Result: Compared to typical architectures that leak information up to 83% of the time, the aspective agentic AI framework enables zero information leakage.

Conclusion: Specialist agents working efficiently in their own information niches can provide significant improvements to both security and efficiency in AI agent systems.

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

### [14] [ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383)
*Yiyang Huang,Zixuan Wang,Zishen Wan,Yapeng Tian,Haobo Xu,Yinhe Han,Yiming Gan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, introducing a safety taxonomy, benchmark (ANNIEBench), and attack framework (ANNIE-Attack) that achieves over 50% success rates across safety categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language-action models in embodied AI robots introduce critical security risks where compromised models can translate adversarial perturbations into unsafe physical actions, requiring new safety definitions and methodologies beyond traditional ML security.

Method: Formalized safety violation taxonomy based on physical constraints (distance, velocity, collisions), created ANNIEBench with 2,400 video-action sequences across 9 safety-critical scenarios, and developed ANNIE-Attack framework with task-aware adversarial attacks using an attack leader model.

Result: Attack success rates exceeded 50% across all safety categories (critical, dangerous, risky), demonstrated sparse and adaptive attack strategies, and validated real-world impact through physical robot experiments.

Conclusion: Exposes a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting urgent need for security-driven defenses in physical AI era.

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model

*Zhuo Cao,Yunxiao Shi,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAM-LLM is a hybrid architecture combining LLMs with kinematic models for autonomous driving, using parameter prediction instead of raw coordinates to achieve interpretable lane change trajectory prediction with 80% smaller output size and 98.73% intention accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between contextual reasoning of LLMs and physical precision of kinematic models for autonomous driving, creating interpretable and efficient trajectory prediction.

Method: Finetunes an LLM to output physical parameters of an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM) for lane changes, including lateral displacement, duration, initial lateral velocity, and longitudinal velocity change, while using discrete coordinates for lane-keeping.

Result: Achieves 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods, state-of-the-art intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, with equivalent performance to traditional LLM predictors but with better explainability and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: SAM-LLM provides a complete, continuous, physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently interpretable and computationally efficient, demonstrating significant advantages over coordinate-based prediction methods.

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

### [16] [The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)
*Zichuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Lifecycle (LC) principle with state memory to stabilize training when reviving long-term deactivated neurons, improving generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address training instability caused by reviving long-term deactivated neurons with random weights, which disrupts learned knowledge and causes destructive optimization shocks.

Method: Lifecycle principle with state memory - instead of re-initializing revived neurons, restores parameters to their last known effective state to preserve learned knowledge and smooth the loss landscape.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows LC smoothes loss landscape towards flatter minima. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate improved generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm state memory is essential for these gains.

Conclusion: The Lifecycle principle with state memory effectively addresses training instability from long-term neuron deactivation, leading to better generalization and robustness through preserved knowledge and smoother optimization.

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Motivation: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching in vast, partially observable environments requires real-time response and effective coordination under uncertainty.

Method: Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for UAV coordination, tested with 10 UAVs in a custom simulation of Iranian leopard habitat protection.

Result: Superior performance in detection accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence compared to standard algorithms like PPO and DDPG.

Conclusion: Combining EM inference with MARL significantly improves decentralized decision-making in complex conservation scenarios, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

### [18] [Beyond Synthetic Augmentation: Group-Aware Threshold Calibration for Robust Balanced Accuracy in Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02592)
*Hunter Gittlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Group-aware threshold calibration (setting different decision thresholds for different demographic groups) outperforms synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE and CT-GAN for handling class imbalance, achieving 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy while improving worst-group performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with traditional solutions like synthetic data generation often creating additional problems. The paper aims to find a more robust and effective approach to address class imbalance across different demographic groups.

Method: The researchers propose group-aware threshold calibration, which involves setting different decision thresholds for different demographic groups rather than using a single threshold across all groups. They conducted extensive experiments across seven model families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods.

Result: Group-specific thresholds achieved 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced accuracy. The method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy. Applying group thresholds to synthetically augmented data yielded minimal additional benefit.

Conclusion: Group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance compared to synthetic data generation methods, providing fine-grained control over group-level performance without the redundancy of combining both approaches.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

TL;DR: DPO-PRO is a robust LLM fine-tuning method for designing reward functions from human preferences in resource allocation problems, using distributionally robust optimization to handle preference uncertainty with less conservatism than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of aligning LLMs with complex, ambiguous objectives in public health resource allocation where human preferences are expressed in natural language and data is limited, requiring robustness to noisy preference signals.

Method: Proposes DPO-PRO, a Direct Preference Optimization algorithm enhanced with lightweight Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) formulation to account for uncertainty in preference distribution while being less conservative than previous DRO-based DPO methods.

Result: DPO-PRO consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants, achieves comparable performance to self-reflection-based baselines for reward function design, and requires significantly lower inference-time cost.

Conclusion: DPO-PRO provides an effective and efficient solution for robust LLM fine-tuning in complex public health applications, demonstrating superior robustness and practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

### [20] [Imitate Optimal Policy: Prevail and Induce Action Collapse in Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02737)
*Zhongzhu Zhou,Yibo Yang,Ziyan Chen,Fengxiang Bie,Haojun Xia,Xiaoxia Wu,Robert Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Bernard Ghanem,Shuaiwen Leon Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy gradient methods with deep neural networks exhibit Action Collapse (AC) - where state-action activations collapse towards optimal action means and form a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). The paper proposes ACPG method that fixes an ETF as the action selection layer to accelerate and improve policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the representational structures in policy networks and leverage the observed neural collapse phenomenon (Action Collapse) to improve policy gradient methods by enforcing an optimal ETF configuration.

Method: Proposes Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) which affixes a synthetic equiangular tight frame (ETF) as the action selection layer, inducing the policy DNN to produce an ideal configuration while remaining optimal.

Result: Experiments across various OpenAI Gym environments show that ACPG can be integrated into any discrete policy gradient methods and leads to faster, more robust reward improvements.

Conclusion: Learning activations with a fixed ETF structure naturally leads to Action Collapse and enables more efficient policy optimization, making ACPG a beneficial enhancement to standard policy gradient methods.

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

*Saarang Panchavati,Corey Arnold,William Speier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba-based foundation model for EEG analysis achieves 0.72 AUROC in seizure detection, showing promise for clinical neurological disorder diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG data is noisy, high-dimensional, and nonlinear, making automated analysis challenging. Traditional ML methods often fail to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics in EEG signals needed for accurate neurological disorder diagnosis.

Method: Trained a Mamba-based selective state space model on large EEG dataset through self-supervised reconstruction task followed by supervised seizure detection task. Used both seizure and non-seizure EEG recordings.

Result: Achieved AUROC of 0.72 on held-out test set for seizure detection, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in EEG analysis.

Conclusion: This approach represents a significant step toward developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data analysis, leveraging modern sequence modeling techniques to handle EEG complexities.

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm for Mean Field Games that efficiently finds Nash equilibria without averaging or historical sampling, showing superior convergence and robustness to common noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning Nash equilibria in Mean Field Games is challenging when initial distributions are unknown or populations face common noise, requiring more efficient and robust methods.

Method: Developed a DRL algorithm inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent that achieves population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical sampling.

Result: Numerical experiments on seven canonical examples showed superior convergence properties compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly DRL Fictitious Play, with robust performance under common noise.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides an efficient and adaptable approach for finding Nash equilibria in MFGs, demonstrating strong convergence and robustness to various initial distributions and common noise scenarios.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

### [23] [LExI: Layer-Adaptive Active Experts for Efficient MoE Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02753)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Sandeep Madireddy,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LExI is a data-free optimization technique that dynamically determines the optimal number of active experts per layer in MoE models, significantly improving inference efficiency with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE pruning strategies only reduce memory usage but don't improve inference performance on GPUs, and fixed expert activation across layers leads to redundant computation and suboptimal performance.

Method: LExI leverages only model weights to estimate layer importance and adaptively assigns the optimal number of active experts per layer without requiring data.

Result: LExI significantly outperforms traditional MoE pruning in inference efficiency with negligible accuracy loss. Qwen1.5-MoE achieves same throughput with 10% better accuracy than traditional expert pruning on H100 GPU.

Conclusion: LExI provides an effective data-free approach to optimize MoE models by adaptively controlling expert activation per layer, delivering substantial inference efficiency gains while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

*Hankang Gu,Yuli Zhang,Chengming Wang,Ruiyuan Jiang,Ziheng Qiao,Pengfei Fan,Dongyao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DHCP, a hierarchical DRL model for traffic signal control that allocates cycle time between directions and movements to address limitations of existing choose-phase and switch paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL-based traffic signal control methods have limitations - choose-phase paradigm disrupts driver anticipation and safety, while switch paradigm leads to unfair and inefficient phase allocations with disproportionate extensions.

Method: Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP) uses two-level hierarchy: high-level agent allocates total cycle time between NS and EW directions based on traffic state; low-level agent divides allocated duration within each direction between straight and left-turn movements.

Result: Empirical testing on real and synthetic road networks with multiple traffic flow datasets shows DHCP achieves best performance against all baselines.

Conclusion: Hierarchical cycle planning approach enables more flexible and efficient traffic signal control while maintaining predictable phase sequences for driver safety.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

TL;DR: Transparent Earth is a transformer-based model that reconstructs subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets using modality encodings and positional encodings, enabling in-context learning and scaling to arbitrary modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing Earth's subsurface properties from diverse, sparse, and multi-modal datasets that vary in resolution and observation types.

Method: Transformer architecture with positional encodings and modality encodings derived from text embeddings of modality descriptions, supporting in-context learning and arbitrary modality integration.

Result: Reduces stress angle prediction errors by more than a factor of three on validation data, with improved performance through parameter scaling.

Conclusion: Transparent Earth serves as a foundational model for Earth's subsurface that can predict any subsurface property globally and scales effectively with new modalities.

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework called Structured Basis Function Network that bridges multi-hypothesis prediction and ensemble learning through Bregman divergence-based centroidal aggregation, providing parametric control over bias-variance-diversity trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack a unified framework that combines the diversity of multi-hypothesis prediction with the principled aggregation of ensemble learning while maintaining consistency with loss geometry.

Method: Proposes Structured Basis Function Network that links multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. Supports both closed-form least-squares estimator and gradient-based procedures for general objectives.

Result: The framework provides tunable diversity mechanism for parametric control of bias-variance-diversity trade-off and successfully connects multi-hypothesis generalization with loss-aware ensemble aggregation.

Conclusion: Experiments validate the relationship between the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness in studying complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing difficulty with deep learning predictors.

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

TL;DR: A novel framework for pre-training GNNs by learning Laplacian eigenvectors to capture global graph structure, outperforming baselines on structure-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MPNNs struggle with global and regional graph structure due to over-smoothing, especially as network depth increases. Low-frequency Laplacian eigenvectors encode global information that can help networks learn large-scale structural patterns.

Method: Pre-training GNNs to predict low-frequency eigenvectors of graph Laplacian matrix. This self-supervised framework is structure-based and can work with synthetic features when task-specific data is sparse.

Result: Models pre-trained via this framework outperform baseline models on various graph structure-based tasks.

Conclusion: The eigenvector-learning pre-training approach is highly flexible, applicable to all graph-based datasets, and effectively captures global structural patterns that traditional MPNNs struggle with.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

Motivation: To address the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from conflict resolution in VLMs and enable more actionable interpretability and targeted interventions for improving model robustness in multimodal settings.

Method: Mechanistic investigation of LLaVA-OV-7B using supervised metrics via linear probes and group-based attention pattern analysis to study how the model handles conflicting multimodal inputs.

Result: A linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in intermediate layers, and attention patterns for conflict detection and resolution diverge at different network stages, supporting functional distinction between these mechanisms.

Conclusion: The decomposition of conflict detection and resolution enables better interpretability and targeted interventions to enhance VLM robustness in challenging multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from

approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JensUn is a new unlearning method for LLMs that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence for better forget-utility trade-off and resilience to relearning, with improved evaluation using LLM semantic judges and worst-case testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for LLMs often fail under thorough evaluation, making it crucial to develop more effective techniques for removing specific information like private data or harmful knowledge.

Method: Leverages Jensen-Shannon Divergence as training objective for both forget and retain sets, creating more stable unlearning dynamics compared to standard loss functions.

Result: Achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods and demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Also introduces LKF dataset for realistic evaluation.

Conclusion: The improved evaluation framework reveals many existing unlearning methods are less effective than previously thought, while JensUn provides superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

*Towhidul Islam,Md Sumon Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparative study of ensemble ML methods for obesity risk prediction, finding stacking outperforms hybrid voting approaches, especially on complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obesity is a critical global health issue associated with chronic diseases. While machine learning shows promise for early obesity risk prediction, there's limited comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques like hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking.

Method: Used two datasets to evaluate three ensemble models: Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking with MLP meta-classifier. Analyzed 9 ML algorithms across 50 hyperparameter configurations to select top base learners. Included preprocessing with dataset balancing and outlier detection.

Result: On Dataset-1: weighted hard voting and stacking achieved similar high performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard voting. On Dataset-2: stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy: 0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to both voting methods.

Conclusion: Ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive capability for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority voting remains a robust alternative for obesity risk prediction.

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

TL;DR: A novel conformal prediction algorithm called CPTC that handles time series with change points by integrating state prediction with online conformal prediction, proving validity and showing improved performance on 6 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conformal prediction methods struggle with time series data containing sudden shifts (change points) in the underlying data-generating process, creating a need for better uncertainty quantification in non-stationary time series.

Method: Proposes CPTC algorithm that integrates a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series with change points.

Result: Proves CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity under minimum assumptions, and demonstrates practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets with improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: CPTC successfully addresses the challenge of change points in time series conformal prediction, providing valid and adaptive uncertainty quantification for non-stationary time series data.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A test-time computing strategy for PDEs that uses computational resources during inference to improve prediction accuracy with fewer training samples and smaller models, using reward models to evaluate spatio-temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PDE foundation models are constrained by pretraining datasets, struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance in OOD cases, and have high compute and training data requirements that limit their use in critical applications.

Method: Introduces test-time computing (TTC) strategy inspired by LLM thinking strategies, using two types of reward models to evaluate predictions of a stochastic model for spatio-temporal consistency.

Result: Demonstrated on compressible Euler-equation simulations from PDEGym benchmark, showing TTC captures improved predictions compared to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference.

Conclusion: TTC framework represents a foundational step toward advanced reasoning algorithms for PDE modeling, including RL-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

*Carlo Fabrizio,Gianvito Losapio,Marco Mussi,Alberto Maria Metelli,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based distributed reinforcement learning framework for scalable power grid management using GNNs and imitation learning, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional control systems struggle to adapt to renewable energy integration and large-scale power networks, requiring more dynamic and distributed control strategies.

Method: Distributed RL framework with low-level agents on individual power lines coordinated by a high-level manager, using GNNs for topological encoding, imitation learning, and reward shaping. Decomposes both action and observation spaces.

Result: Outperforms standard baselines in Grid2Op simulations and proves more computationally efficient than simulation-based Expert methods.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based distributed RL approach provides an effective and efficient solution for real-time, scalable power grid management.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

*Vikas Kashtriya,Pardeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QI-SMOTE is a quantum-inspired data augmentation technique that addresses class imbalance in medical ML by generating synthetic instances using quantum principles, significantly improving classifier performance on imbalanced medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in medical ML leads to biased models and reduced predictive performance, especially for underrepresented minority classes, which is critical for clinical decision-making.

Method: Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE) leverages quantum principles like quantum evolution and layered entanglement to generate synthetic instances that preserve complex data structures, unlike traditional oversampling methods.

Result: QI-SMOTE significantly improves ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA), kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, outperforming traditional techniques like Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN, and others across Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC metrics.

Conclusion: QI-SMOTE effectively mitigates class imbalance and enhances model robustness in medical diagnostics, demonstrating the potential of quantum-inspired resampling techniques to advance ML methodologies in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

### [35] [Improving Generative Methods for Causal Evaluation via Simulation-Based Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02892)
*Pracheta Amaranath,Vinitra Muralikrishnan,Amit Sharma,David D. Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBICE introduces a simulation-based inference framework that models generative parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution to generate more realistic synthetic datasets for causal estimator evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for synthetic datasets require fixed point estimates of parameters, denying users the ability to express uncertainty and potentially leading to unreliable estimator comparisons.

Method: SBICE leverages simulation-based inference techniques to model generative parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given source data, identifying parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with the source data distribution.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets that support robust causal benchmarking under uncertainty.

Conclusion: SBICE provides a data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking by allowing parameter uncertainty expression and posterior inference, leading to more reliable synthetic dataset generation for causal evaluation.

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A seismic-based elephant detection framework using Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW) and SVM with RBF kernel achieves up to 155.6m detection range and 99% accuracy in controlled conditions, with 70-73% accuracy in natural habitats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of manual classification in existing Human-Elephant Conflict solutions by developing a real-time, computationally efficient seismic detection framework for elephant footfalls.

Method: Introduced Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW) for event detection and used SVM with RBF kernel for classification. Compared with STA/LTA method and conducted feature impact analysis using explainable AI.

Result: Maximum detection range: 155.6m (controlled) and 140m (natural). Classification accuracy: 99% (controlled), 73% (natural habitats), 70% (HEC-prone human habitats). Zero Crossings and DTW Alignment Cost identified as most influential features.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective real-time elephant detection with high accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained implementations in HEC management.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prescription decisions for diabetic foot ulcer offloading footwear are fragmented with varying feature selection, limited personalization, and inconsistent evaluation practices, hindering effective clinical adoption.

Method: Narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols, 25 knowledge-based systems, 8 ML applications) published through August 2025, with thematic analysis of knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation methods, and enabling technologies.

Result: Guidelines emphasize plantar pressure thresholds but lack actionable outputs; knowledge-based systems use rule/sensor logic; ML shows high accuracy but poor explainability. Evaluation methods remain fragmented across different study types.

Conclusion: Proposed 5-part CDSS framework includes minimum viable dataset, hybrid architecture combining rules/optimization/explainable ML, structured feature-level outputs, continuous validation, and clinical workflow integration to enable scalable, patient-centered DFU care.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble methods are computationally expensive for uncertainty quantification in MLIPs, and alternative methods may affect accuracy or cannot be applied to already trained models.

Method: Leverages descriptors from trained graph neural network potentials to estimate residual errors between predictions and ground truth, modeling these residuals as uncertainty proxies through multiple PDRL variants.

Result: Benchmarked against established UQ methods, evaluating both effectiveness and limitations of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: PDRL provides a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for uncertainty quantification that can be applied to already trained models without affecting prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

*Erik M. Lintunen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VendiRL introduces a unified framework for learning diverse skills in self-supervised RL using the Vendi Score from ecology to measure and optimize for various forms of diversity without predefined notions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised RL faces scalability issues in high-dimensional feature spaces and lacks consistent evaluation of skill diversity, making results hard to compare and limiting exploration of different diversity forms.

Method: Adopts the Vendi Score from ecology as a flexible diversity measure, allowing users to specify desired similarity functions. Introduces VendiRL framework that optimizes for diverse skill sets based on different similarity metrics.

Result: The approach enables evaluation of any desired form of diversity and facilitates learning of diversely diverse skill sets that can support pretraining in various interactive environments.

Conclusion: VendiRL provides a unified framework for scalable skill diversity learning and evaluation, addressing current limitations in self-supervised RL by allowing flexible definition and optimization of diverse skill sets.

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AR-KAN combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with autoregressive components to handle almost periodic signals with incommensurate frequencies, outperforming traditional neural networks and ARIMA on 72% of real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks struggle with spectral analysis of signals, particularly when dealing with almost periodic functions composed of signals with incommensurate frequencies, where ARIMA often outperforms neural networks including LLMs.

Method: A hybrid model combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for static nonlinear mapping with a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) component for memory retention, based on the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem to eliminate redundancy while preserving useful information.

Result: Experimental results show that AR-KAN achieves superior performance on 72% of real-world datasets compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: AR-KAN effectively addresses the challenge of analyzing almost periodic signals by integrating the strengths of both neural networks and autoregressive models, providing a robust solution for spectral analysis tasks.

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

*Kaoru Otsuka,Yuki Takezawa,Makoto Yamada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Byz-SGDM introduces delayed momentum aggregation for Byzantine-robust federated learning with partial participation, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail when sampled clients contain Byzantine majority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Byzantine-robust FL methods assume full client participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client availability. Under partial participation, current methods fail when sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority.

Method: Delayed momentum aggregation principle where server aggregates most recently received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from active clients. Implemented as D-Byz-SGDM optimizer.

Result: Established convergence guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match fundamental lower bounds for partial participation setting. Experiments on deep learning tasks showed stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed D-Byz-SGDM method successfully addresses the challenge of Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness against Byzantine attacks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

*Minxin Zhang,Yuxuan Liu,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGO combines orthogonalized momentum updates from Muon with norm-based AdaGrad stepsize adaptation, preserving orthogonality while adapting to optimization landscape with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer shows strong performance but lacks clear learning rate determination, while AdaGrad provides adaptive stepsize scaling. The goal is to combine orthogonalized updates with adaptive stepsize control.

Method: AdaGO integrates norm-based AdaGrad stepsize with orthogonalized momentum updates, maintaining update direction orthogonality while scaling with accumulated past gradient norms. Requires only one additional scalar variable.

Result: Theoretical convergence rates established for nonconvex functions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 classification and function regression show AdaGO outperforms both Muon and Adam.

Conclusion: AdaGO successfully combines orthogonalized updates with adaptive stepsize control, achieving better performance than existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen physiology or recording conditions, necessitating adaptation methods that work without access to source data.

Method: Proposes streaming source-free test-time adaptation combining entropy minimization (Tent) with Batch-Norm statistic refresh, plus safety rails: entropy gate to pause adaptation on uncertain windows and EMA-based reset to prevent drift.

Result: Consistent gains over frozen baseline on Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset with single-lead EEG, achieving seconds-level latency and minimal memory usage while reporting per-stage metrics and Cohen's k.

Conclusion: The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use in sleep staging applications.

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and

*Satyajit Mojumder,Pallock Halder,Tiana Tonge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal data fusion approach combining high-fidelity X-ray imaging with low-cost photodiode absorptivity data for accurate melt pool dynamics prediction in LPBF additive manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed X-ray imaging provides valuable subsurface melt pool insights but is costly and impractical for industrial use, while low-cost photodiode absorptivity data is noisy and unreliable when used alone for prediction.

Method: Multimodal learning framework integrating CNNs for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data and RNNs for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using early fusion strategy and transfer learning to fine-tune RNN models.

Result: Training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either alone. Once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating need for expensive X-ray imaging.

Conclusion: This approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring in additive manufacturing with broad applicability, allowing accurate melt pool prediction without expensive X-ray equipment after initial multimodal training.

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

*Bilge Taskin,Wenxiong Xie,Teddy Lazebnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using LLMs to automate domain knowledge integration in physics-informed symbolic regression, improving equation discovery from noisy data across multiple physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-informed symbolic regression methods require manual feature engineering and domain expertise, limiting accessibility. LLMs' scientific knowledge can automate this process.

Method: Integrate pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, LLama 2) into SR loss functions to evaluate generated equations, using three SR algorithms across three physical dynamics.

Result: LLM integration consistently improves physical dynamics reconstruction, enhances robustness to noise and complexity, with better prompts yielding significant performance gains.

Conclusion: LLMs effectively automate domain knowledge incorporation in symbolic regression, making physics-informed SR more accessible and robust without requiring specialized expertise.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

*Xinzhe Zheng,Zhen-Qun Yang,Haoran Xie,S. Joe Qin,Arlene Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel binary quantization method for LLMs that achieves near-original performance with only 1.007 average bits, outperforming previous binary methods and competing with 4-bit quantization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require substantial memory and computational resources, and while binary quantization offers significant compression benefits, it typically causes notable performance degradation compared to more conservative quantization methods.

Method: Proposes a novel optimization objective for binary quantization with three algorithms, enhancing blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies.

Result: Achieves average bit length of 1.007 bits while maintaining high model quality - quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B attains perplexity of 8.23 (close to original 7.81) and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM (123.90 perplexity). Highly efficient compression taking only 14 seconds for quantization on single CPU core.

Conclusion: The method provides competitive performance with SOTA 4-bit approaches like GPTQ while offering superior compression efficiency, with embarrassingly parallel properties for fast processing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

TL;DR: Extends ReLU Transition Graph framework to model deep ReLU networks as graphs where nodes are linear activation regions and edges connect regions differing by single ReLU flip, revealing structural properties that govern generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks through discrete functional geometry, providing new tools to analyze generalization behavior.

Method: Extends RTG framework, proves structural properties at random initialization (expansion, binomial degree distributions, spectral properties), derives capacity bounds via region entropy and generalization bounds via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence, and empirically constructs RTGs for small networks.

Result: RTGs exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and spectral properties; region entropy saturates under overparameterization; spectral gap correlates with generalization; KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional smoothness.

Conclusion: Provides unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks through discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to understand, diagnose, and improve generalization with validated theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to other reasoning-intensive domains is challenging due to scarce high-quality verifiable datasets and high human supervision costs.

Method: Framework with two components: LoongBench (8,729 human-vetted examples across 12 domains with executable code) and LoongEnv (modular synthetic data generation environment). Forms agent-environment loop for RL where LLM agents are rewarded for CoT solutions matching code-executed answers.

Result: Benchmarked LoongBench on various LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and performance bottlenecks. Conducted comprehensive analysis of synthetic data examining correctness, difficulty, and diversity.

Conclusion: The Loong Project provides a scalable solution for synthetic data generation and verification across multiple reasoning domains, enabling RLVR applications beyond traditional mathematics/programming domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization but suffers from inefficiency in distributed large-batch training due to synchronization bottlenecks.

Method: LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy to create a smoothed sharpness-aware loss landscape, eliminating synchronization issues.

Result: LSAM accelerates large-batch convergence, eliminates synchronization bottlenecks, and achieves higher final accuracy compared to data-parallel SAM.

Conclusion: LSAM successfully preserves SAM's generalization advantages while providing superior efficiency in distributed training environments.

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep

while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps

TL;DR: AI framework combining numerical spectral simulation and deep learning for automated, standard-free multiradionuclide analysis in TDCR spectroscopy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional TDCR spectroscopy including limited automation and reliance on mixture-specific standards that may not be readily available

Method: Geant4 simulations for beta spectra generation coupled with statistically modeled detector response sampling, trained on neural network covering various nuclei mix ratios and quenching scenarios

Result: High accuracy across tasks: activity proportions (MAE=0.009), detection efficiencies (MAE=0.002), spectral reconstruction (SSIM=0.9998)

Conclusion: AI-driven methodology shows significant potential for automated safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization and real-time processing capabilities, especially useful when reference materials are unavailable

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

TL;DR: First empirical study quantifying the Rashomon effect in XAI for autonomous driving action prediction, showing significant explanation disagreement across different model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI is crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, but the reliability is challenged by the Rashomon effect where equally accurate models provide divergent explanations.

Method: Used Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) as symbolic scene representation, trained Rashomon sets of interpretable gradient boosting models and complex Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), measured explanation agreement using feature attribution methods.

Result: Found significant explanation disagreement both within and between model classes, suggesting explanation ambiguity is inherent to the problem.

Conclusion: Explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the action prediction problem in driving scenes, not just a modeling artifact, which challenges XAI reliability.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

TL;DR: Current attribution method evaluation suffers from threshold selection bias that can reverse method rankings. The paper introduces a threshold-free AUC-IoU framework that evaluates attribution quality across all thresholds, providing reliable method differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution evaluation protocols use single-threshold binarization, which introduces bias and can dramatically alter method rankings by over 200 percentage points, undermining reliable conclusions about method performance.

Method: Proposes a threshold-free framework using Area Under the Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU) to evaluate attribution quality across the full threshold spectrum, eliminating threshold selection bias.

Result: Evaluation of seven attribution methods on dermatological imaging shows single-threshold metrics yield contradictory results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation. XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated Gradients, with performance variations up to 269% across lesion scales.

Conclusion: The threshold-free framework establishes methodological standards that eliminate evaluation artifacts, provides theoretical insight into attribution behavior, and enables evidence-based method selection for robust comparison in medical imaging and beyond.

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and

TL;DR: Integrates contrastive learning into Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning to learn from both successes and failures, overcoming biases and enabling better exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of GCSL: agents learn only from self-generated experiences (reinforcing biases) and only from successful outcomes (ignoring failures).

Method: Proposes novel model combining contrastive learning with GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure experiences.

Result: Empirical evaluations show algorithm overcomes initial biases, enables more exploratory behavior, and identifies effective policies.

Conclusion: Superior performance across challenging environments by learning from both positive and negative experiences through contrastive learning integration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN, a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data, was successfully applied to geotechnical site characterization tasks, outperforming traditional hierarchical Bayesian models in accuracy and efficiency for spatial prediction and parameter imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of foundation models for tabular data in geotechnical engineering problems, specifically for spatial variation prediction and missing parameter imputation, potentially revolutionizing probabilistic site characterization methods.

Method: Used TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning setting without hyperparameter tuning, providing additional context from the big indirect database (BID) for two benchmark problems: spatial undrained shear strength prediction and missing mechanical parameter imputation.

Result: TabPFN achieved superior accuracy and well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to hierarchical Bayesian models. For spatial prediction, it delivered better accuracy and order-of-magnitude faster runtime. For parameter imputation, it achieved lower RMSE for all target parameters with well-quantified uncertainties.

Conclusion: This marks the first successful use of a tabular foundation model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in probabilistic site characterization with improved accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics like F1 and point-adjusted F1 misrepresent model performance in real-world time series applications where ground truth events are single-point annotations but underlying phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused.

Method: Introduces a window-based F1 metric (F1_w) that incorporates temporal tolerance, allowing for robust assessment when exact event alignment is not feasible. Evaluated on three physiological datasets including two in-the-wild and one experimental dataset.

Result: F1_w reveals meaningful model performance patterns invisible to conventional metrics. Using TimesFM predictions, only temporally tolerant metrics show statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in in-the-wild use cases.

Conclusion: The choice of evaluation metric strongly influences model performance interpretation. F1_w addresses key gaps in time series evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where temporal precision requirements vary by context.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

### [56] [Exploring the Design Space of Fair Tree Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03204)
*Kiara Stempel,Mattia Cerrato,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores three design options for fair decision trees, focusing on integrating fairness constraints during training. While previous work only covered option 1 (objective function with y and s) and greedy option 2, this paper introduces and experimentally evaluates the full constraint-based option 2 and the dual-tree option 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fair decision tree techniques primarily focus on constrained objective functions or greedy constraint satisfaction, leaving other design options unexplored. The authors aim to systematically characterize the full design space of fair tree learning algorithms.

Method: The paper introduces two additional design options: (1) full constraint-based approach where fairness constraints are strictly enforced during tree construction with backtracking, and (2) dual-tree approach with separate trees for target variable y and sensitive attribute s. These are experimentally evaluated on multiple datasets.

Result: Experimental characterization shows the performance and fairness trade-offs of the different design options across various datasets, providing insights into when each approach is most effective.

Conclusion: The paper expands the design space for fair decision trees by introducing and evaluating previously unexplored options, providing practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding of fairness-accuracy trade-offs in tree-based models.

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

TL;DR: FoMEMO is a foundation model approach for expensive multi-objective optimization that uses synthetic pre-training and in-context learning to achieve superior adaptability without requiring domain-specific training or updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for expensive multi-objective optimization either rebuild models from scratch for each problem or require extensive domain-specific pre-training, making them impractical for real-world emerging applications.

Method: Pre-train a foundation model on hundreds of millions of synthetic data, then use in-context optimization based on predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors without any subsequent model training or updates.

Result: Superior adaptability to unknown problems and competitive performance across various synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FoMEMO provides a generalizable and practical solution for expensive multi-objective optimization that doesn't require domain-specific training or model updates during optimization.

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

### [58] [Structure Transfer: an Inference-Based Calculus for the Transformation of Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03249)
*Daniel Raggi,Gem Stapleton,Mateja Jamnik,Aaron Stockdill,Grecia Garcia Garcia,Peter C-H. Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel calculus called structure transfer enables representation transformation across diverse representational systems while ensuring specified relations like semantic equivalence are maintained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the fundamental problem of devising representational-system agnostic techniques for driving representation transformation and choice, enabling effective communication and reasoning across different representation systems.

Method: Structure transfer calculus uses schemas that encode knowledge about representational systems to preserve information across relations between any pair of systems. It builds on Representational Systems Theory and construction spaces to model diverse RSs including formal languages, geometric figures, diagrams, and informal notations.

Result: The method provides a system-agnostic calculus that can generate target representations from source representations while ensuring desired relations hold, enabling representation transformation across a wide range of practical settings.

Conclusion: Structure transfer offers a general approach for representation transformation that works across diverse representational systems, addressing the fundamental challenge of representation choice and enabling more effective communication and reasoning.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

*Yuxuan Gu,Wuyang Zhou,Giorgos Iacovides,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TeRA is a novel PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates with vector-level parameter efficiency using tensor networks, outperforming both high-rank adapters and vector-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-style adapters face a trade-off between expressivity (high-rank) and parameter efficiency (vector-based). High-rank methods sacrifice efficiency while vector methods lack expressivity.

Method: Parameterizes weight updates as a Tucker-like tensor network with frozen random factors shared across layers, training only small layer-specific scaling vectors from diagonal matrices.

Result: TeRA matches or outperforms high-rank adapters while maintaining parameter efficiency similar to vector-based methods, validated through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: TeRA successfully decouples rank from parameter count, providing both high expressivity and extreme parameter efficiency in LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Minjung Park,Gyuyeon Na,Soyoun Kim,Sunyoung Moon,HyeonJeong Cha,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD is a novel early-warning framework for cryptocurrency anomaly detection that incorporates lead time, uses Peak-Valley sampling to handle class imbalance, and employs hyperbolic embeddings to capture blockchain network properties, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cryptocurrency anomaly detection methods are model-centric and post hoc, only flagging anomalies after they occur, which provides limited preventive value. There's a need for proactive early-warning systems that can detect anomalies before they happen to ensure financial integrity and security.

Method: HyPV-LEAD integrates three key innovations: 1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, 2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and 3) hyperbolic embedding to capture hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data shows HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies confirm each component provides complementary benefits.

Conclusion: HyPV-LEAD shifts anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, establishing a robust foundation for real-time risk management, AML compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

TL;DR: Proposes neural network-based solution for RIS element allocation that reduces computational complexity while improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exponentially increasing computational complexity of conventional iterative optimization methods for RIS phase configuration and resource allocation as the number of RIS elements grows.

Method: Five-layer fully connected neural network combined with preprocessing technique to reduce input dimensionality, lower computational complexity, and enhance scalability.

Result: Reduces computational overhead while improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS element allocation schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed NN-based solution achieves better performance with reduced computational complexity, making it significantly more scalable than iterative optimization algorithms for RIS applications.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoMap creates a topographical map of input feature space for DL testing by combining dimensionality reduction and clustering, with automated configuration selection using a DNN evaluator, achieving 35-61% improvement over random selection in mutation testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL testing approaches focus on specific failure-inducing features while neglecting others in different feature space regions, lacking comprehensive grouping of inputs by failure-causing features.

Method: Black-box, model-agnostic approach using dimensionality reduction for input embeddings, clustering for discriminative grouping, and a DNN evaluator to automatically select optimal embedding/clustering configurations.

Result: TopoMap generates distinguishable and meaningful regions in input space maps, outperforms random selection by 35% on killable mutants and 61% on non-killable mutants in mutation analysis.

Conclusion: TopoMap provides an effective method for creating comprehensive topographical maps of DL input spaces, enabling better understanding of failure patterns and more efficient test input selection for mutation testing.

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

TL;DR: A generative flow matching framework for modeling multimodal distributions in bifurcation phenomena, preserving symmetries through equivariant modeling and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic machine learning models fail to capture multiple coexisting stable solutions in nonlinear dynamical systems with symmetry breaking, averaging over solutions and missing lower-symmetry outcomes.

Method: Proposes a generative framework based on flow matching with symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions for equivariant modeling of probability distributions over bifurcation outcomes.

Result: Validated on toy models and complex physical problems (buckling beams, Allen-Cahn equation), demonstrating significant outperformance over non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations.

Conclusion: Flow matching provides a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems, enabling direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANs show better privacy protection against membership inference attacks than diffusion models under differential privacy, with both theoretical stability analysis and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and compare the privacy risks of differentially private GANs and diffusion models against membership inference attacks, as their sensitivity to such attacks remains poorly understood despite both being trainable under DP.

Method: Used a unified theoretical stability-based analysis to compare sensitivity to data perturbations, followed by comprehensive empirical study with standardized MIA pipeline across datasets and privacy budgets.

Result: GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data perturbations than diffusion models, showing marked privacy robustness gap in favor of GANs even in strong DP regimes.

Conclusion: Model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage, with GANs demonstrating structural advantage in resisting membership inference attacks compared to diffusion models under differential privacy.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

TL;DR: epiGPTope is a language model that generates novel epitope sequences and classifies them by origin, enabling efficient synthetic epitope library design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rational design of synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the vast combinatorial sequence space (20^n combinations), making experimental screening infeasible even with high-throughput techniques.

Method: Developed epiGPTope - a large language model pre-trained on protein data and fine-tuned on linear epitopes to generate novel epitope-like sequences. Also trained statistical classifiers to predict bacterial vs. viral origin of epitopes.

Result: The model generates sequences with statistical properties analogous to known epitopes. The combination of generative and predictive models helps narrow candidate libraries and increases likelihood of identifying specific epitopes.

Conclusion: This approach using only primary amino acid sequences (no geometric framework or hand-crafted features) enables faster, more cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes for biotechnology applications.

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional resource allocation methods often fail to account for agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments, leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution in multi-agent intelligence systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides equitable resource allocation for fleet intelligence, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional methods while offering insights into fairness impacts across different agent categories.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of

TL;DR: PROF is a data curation method that combines process and outcome rewards through consistency-driven sample selection to improve mathematical reasoning in RLVR, achieving over 4% accuracy gains over blending approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods face limitations - Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) are too coarse-grained and Process Reward Models (PRMs) are noisy and susceptible to reward hacking, creating a need for better integration of fine-grained process guidance with accurate outcome rewards.

Method: PROF uses consistency-driven sample selection that retains correct responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training sample balance, rather than naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function.

Result: Extensive experiments show PROF consistently improves final accuracy by over 4% compared to blending approaches and strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Conclusion: PROF effectively harmonizes noisy fine-grained process rewards with accurate coarse-grained outcome rewards through consistency-driven data curation, providing a superior approach for mathematical reasoning tasks in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, particularly in bioinformatics and clinical applications, where existing imputation methods lack consistent performance across different scenarios.

Method: Proposes Meta-Imputation Balanced (MIB) method that learns to combine outputs of multiple base imputers by training on synthetically masked data with known ground truth to predict the most suitable imputed value.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved accuracy in predicting missing values compared to individual imputation methods.

Conclusion: The work shows the potential of ensemble learning for imputation and enables more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

TL;DR: Quantization in DP-SGD causes significant accuracy degradation due to noise amplification. QPQuant framework uses dynamic layer selection and loss-aware prioritization to reduce quantization variance while maintaining DP guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces training costs but causes disproportionately high accuracy degradation in differentially private SGD due to noise amplification of quantization variance.

Method: QPQuant framework with probabilistic layer sampling rotation and differentially private loss sensitivity estimator to adaptively select which layers to quantize each epoch.

Result: Outperforms static quantization baselines, achieves near Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs, 2.21x theoretical throughput improvements with <2% accuracy drop on ResNet18/50 and DenseNet121.

Conclusion: Dynamic quantization with adaptive layer selection effectively mitigates accuracy degradation in DP-SGD while maintaining privacy guarantees and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Motivation: Fixed-time traffic signal control relies on manual design using hand-crafted formulas like Webster's method, which is labor-intensive and suboptimal under heterogeneous or congested conditions.

Method: Formulates traffic signal control as program synthesis, representing algorithms as Python functions and optimizing them through external evaluations (traffic simulator) and evolutionary search powered by large language models.

Result: Discovered algorithms significantly outperform Webster's baseline, achieving 20.1% reduction in average delay and 47.1% reduction in average stops at signalized intersections.

Conclusion: This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for automated algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering and providing practical insights for traffic engineers.

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

### [72] [Robult: Leveraging Redundancy and Modality Specific Features for Robust Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03477)
*Duy A. Nguyen,Abhi Kamboj,Minh N. Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult is a scalable multimodal learning framework that addresses missing modalities and limited labeled data through information-theoretic optimization of PU contrastive loss and latent reconstruction, achieving superior performance in semi-supervised and missing modality scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of missing modalities and limited labeled data in multimodal learning by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through information-theoretic principles.

Method: Uses two core objectives: (1) soft Positive-Unlabeled contrastive loss for task-relevant feature alignment with limited labeled data, and (2) latent reconstruction loss to retain unique modality-specific information within a modular design.

Result: Superior performance over existing approaches across diverse datasets in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts, with lightweight design enabling scalability.

Conclusion: Robult provides an effective and scalable solution for robust multimodal learning that ensures resilience to incomplete modalities and integrates seamlessly with existing architectures for real-world applications.

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Conclusion: SafeProtein successfully identifies vulnerabilities in protein foundation models and provides insights for developing robust security protection technologies for frontier AI models in biology.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the

heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks

### [74] [On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493)
*Han Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEnt is a new entropy control method for LLM-RL that addresses issues with conventional entropy regularization in large language models by using clamped entropy bonus with automatic coefficient adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional entropy regularization works well in traditional RL but fails in LLM-RL due to extremely large response space and sparse optimal outputs, requiring a specialized approach.

Method: Proposes AEnt with clamped entropy bonus using re-normalized policy on smaller token space, plus automatic coefficient adjustment to control entropy-induced bias while maintaining exploration benefits.

Result: AEnt consistently outperforms baselines across multiple math-reasoning tasks with different base models and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed AEnt method effectively addresses entropy control challenges in LLM-RL settings and demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

### [75] [Warming Up for Zeroth-Order Federated Pre-Training with Low Resource Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03503)
*Gwen Legate,Irina Rish,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZOWarmUp - a federated zeroth-order optimizer that enables low-resource edge devices to participate in training from random initialization, improving data diversity and reducing system bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory and communication constraints exclude many edge devices from federated learning, creating system bias and limiting data diversity. Current zeroth-order methods are only used for fine-tuning due to high variance issues.

Method: Developed ZOWarmUp, a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer that uses variance reduction techniques and leverages differing client capabilities. It requires only random seeds instead of full gradients, minimizing communication costs.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and model architectures show ZOWarmUp is robust and applicable in diverse scenarios. It enables participation of previously excluded low-resource clients.

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp provides access to greater volume and diversity of data by including under-represented edge devices, improving training outcomes in federated learning systems with resource-constrained participants.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LimiX is the first large structured-data model that treats tabular data as a joint distribution, enabling unified handling of classification, regression, imputation, and generation tasks through a single model with query-based conditional prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models that can handle structured data (tabular data) alongside language and physical world models, addressing the gap in current foundation model capabilities.

Method: Pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with episodic, context-conditional objective. The model predicts query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, enabling training-free adaptation at inference through a unified interface.

Result: LimiX consistently outperforms strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with diverse characteristics.

Conclusion: LimiX demonstrates superior performance across multiple tabular tasks with a single model, avoiding task-specific architectures or custom training, and represents a significant advancement in structured-data foundation models that are publicly available under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

### [77] [Some patterns of sleep quality and Daylight Saving Time across countries: a predictive and exploratory analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03358)
*Bhanu Sharma,Eugene Pinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DST's impact on sleep varies by latitude - DST countries sleep longer overall but latitude reverses this effect


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how Daylight Saving Time practices affect sleep durations across different countries and geographical regions

Method: Analyzed sleep data from 61 countries, grouped by DST observance, used statistical correlation analysis and visualizations to compare sleep patterns between DST and non-DST regions

Result: Countries observing DST generally report longer sleep durations, but latitude moderates this effect - at lower latitudes DST countries sleep less, while at higher latitudes they sleep more

Conclusion: Geographical location moderates DST's influence on sleep patterns, suggesting latitude plays a key role in how time changes affect sleep duration

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

*Paul-Gauthier Noé,Andreas Nautsch,Driss Matrouf,Pierre-Michel Bousquet,Jean-François Bonastre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends calibration concepts from binary to multi-hypothesis cases using Aitchison geometry and isometric-log-ratio transformations, enabling calibrated likelihood functions for improved interpretability in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of likelihood functions has been limited to binary cases with only two hypotheses, creating a need to extend calibration concepts to multiple hypotheses scenarios for broader applicability.

Method: Uses Aitchison geometry of the simplex to extend log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) to multiple hypotheses, developing isometric-log-ratio transformed likelihood functions and extending calibration definitions, idempotence properties, and distribution constraints.

Result: Successfully extends binary calibration concepts to multi-hypothesis cases, providing a mathematical framework for calibrated likelihood functions with more than two classes, demonstrated through improved interpretability in non-linear discriminant analysis.

Conclusion: The paper provides a conceptual extension of likelihood function calibration from binary to multiple hypotheses using geometric approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable probabilistic methods in machine learning applications.

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

### [79] [Cluster and then Embed: A Modular Approach for Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03373)
*Elizabeth Coda,Ery Arias-Castro,Gal Mishne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular approach for dimensionality reduction that first clusters data, then embeds each cluster separately, and finally aligns clusters to preserve both local and global structure better than t-SNE/UMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE and UMAP tend to distort global geometry while preserving local clusters. There's a need for more transparent methods that maintain both local and global data structure.

Method: Three-step modular approach: 1) Cluster the data first, 2) Embed each cluster separately, 3) Align the clusters to obtain a global embedding.

Result: Competitive performance with existing methods (t-SNE/UMAP) on synthetic and real-world datasets while providing greater transparency.

Conclusion: The proposed modular clustering-then-embedding approach offers improved transparency and preserves both local and global geometry better than traditional dimensionality reduction methods.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

*Taisiya Khakharova,Lucas Sakizloglou,Leen Lambers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for sepsis treatment recommendation, modeling patient data as time-evolving heterogeneous graphs and combining representation learning with reinforcement learning policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis treatment requires precise fluid and vasopressor dosing, but existing automated methods rely on relational data. Graph-based approaches may better capture complex healthcare data relationships and provide more effective treatment recommendations.

Method: Modeled MIMIC-III patient data as time-evolving heterogeneous graphs. Used GraphSAGE and GATv2 architectures for patient state representation learning, decoupled from policy learning. Trained encoders with decoders to predict next patient states, then used dBCQ algorithm for policy learning.

Result: Experimental evaluation confirmed the potential of graph-based approaches for sepsis treatment, though highlighted the complexity of representation learning in this medical domain.

Conclusion: Graph neural networks show promise for sepsis treatment recommendation by better capturing complex patient data relationships, but representation learning remains challenging and requires further research in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

TL;DR: This paper studies initialization strategies for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), proposing theory-driven and empirical power-law approaches that outperform baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs offer enhanced flexibility and interpretability but their initialization strategies remain largely unexplored, creating a need for systematic investigation of effective initialization schemes.

Method: Proposed two theory-driven initialization approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot methods, plus an empirical power-law family with tunable exponents. Evaluated through large-scale grid searches on function fitting and PDE benchmarks, Neural Tangent Kernel analysis, and Feynman dataset evaluations.

Result: Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms baseline in parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest overall performance across tasks and varying architecture sizes.

Conclusion: Proper initialization is crucial for KAN performance, with power-law initialization emerging as the most effective approach, providing practical guidance for training KANs across different applications.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

*Phuc Pham,Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LINKER is a sequence-based deep learning model that predicts protein-ligand residue-functional group interactions using only protein sequences and ligand SMILES, without requiring 3D structural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand interpretability rely on 3D structural input or distance-based contact labels, limiting their applicability and biological relevance. There's a need for models that can predict biologically meaningful interactions using only sequence information.

Method: LINKER uses structure-supervised attention with interaction labels derived from 3D protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. It abstracts ligand structures into functional groups and predicts interaction types rather than spatial proximity.

Result: Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark show that structure-informed supervision over functional group abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth biochemical annotations.

Conclusion: LINKER enables accurate prediction of residue-functional group interactions using only sequence-level input, making it applicable for large-scale analysis where structural data is unavailable, while maintaining biological relevance through functional group abstraction.

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

TL;DR: A GNN-based framework for simulating liquid dynamics with rigid body interactions, using BVH algorithm for collision handling, enabling generalization to unseen objects and manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven approaches for fluid simulation are limited to static environments or simple manipulations, lacking capability for complex interactions with dynamically moving rigid bodies.

Method: Graph neural network framework with particles as graph nodes, using bounding volume hierarchy algorithm for particle-object collision detection and handling complex surface geometries.

Result: Model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings, generalizes to unseen objects and novel manipulation tasks (stirring, scooping), and enables gradient-based optimization for control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN framework successfully handles complex liquid-rigid body interactions and enables generalization beyond training scenarios, providing an effective solution for fluid manipulation and control tasks.

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

*Erkan Bayram,Mohamed-Ali Belabbas,Tamer Başar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical foundation for Tuning without Forgetting (TwF) method, proving it forms a Banach submanifold and preserves mappings exactly during sequential training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous mathematical foundation for the TwF method introduced in previous work, moving beyond first-order approximation to exact mapping preservation.

Method: Prove that the parameter subspace in TwF forms a Banach submanifold of finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and characterize its tangent space.

Result: TwF corresponds to continuation/deformation along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, enabling exact mapping preservation during sequential training.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis validates TwF as an exact method for sequential training without forgetting, providing mathematical rigor to the approach.

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents CropGlobe, a global crop dataset with 300,000 samples from 8 countries, and proposes CropNet with temporal augmentation to improve cross-regional crop classification using invariant Sentinel-2 features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited ground sample availability constrains large-scale crop classification across geographic regions, requiring solutions for performance declines under geospatial shifts.

Method: Constructed CropGlobe dataset with global coverage, compared transferability of Sentinel-2 temporal features and EMIT hyperspectral features, and designed CropNet CNN with temporal data augmentation (time shift, scale, and magnitude warping).

Result: 2D median temporal features from Sentinel-2 showed strongest invariance across all transfer scenarios, and temporal augmentation improved robustness, especially with limited training data diversity.

Conclusion: The work identifies invariant feature representations that enhance geographic transferability and provides a path toward scalable, low-cost crop type applications across diverse global regions.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show increasing autonomy but their intentional deception (lying) remains underexplored compared to unintentional hallucinations, raising trustworthiness concerns in real-world applications.

Method: Used mechanistic interpretability techniques including logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify deceptive behavior patterns and develop behavioral steering vectors for control.

Result: Uncovered neural mechanisms underlying deception, established methods to manipulate lying tendencies, and found a Pareto frontier showing dishonesty can enhance goal optimization in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: The study contributes to AI ethics by revealing risks of intentional deception in LLMs and developing potential safeguards for high-stakes deployments, highlighting the trade-offs between honesty and performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

### [87] [Synthetic Founders: AI-Generated Social Simulations for Startup Validation Research in Computational Social Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02605)

TL;DR: Comparative study shows LLM-driven synthetic personas can simulate human perspectives with high fidelity on convergent themes but have blind spots in areas requiring lived experience and relational consequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the fidelity and limitations of AI-enabled simulation by comparing human interview data with LLM-generated synthetic personas in the context of startup founder perspectives on AI-powered validation.

Method: Conducted interviews with 15 early-stage startup founders, replicated the same protocol with AI-generated founder and investor personas, and performed structured thematic synthesis to identify convergent, divergent, and unique themes.

Result: Found four categories: convergent themes (commitment signals, trust barriers, efficiency), partial overlaps (different concerns about validation), human-only themes (relational value, market skepticism), and synthetic-only themes (false positives, trauma blind spots).

Conclusion: LLM-driven personas represent a hybrid social simulation category that complements empirical studies by extending hypothesis space and accelerating validation, but are bounded by lack of lived history and relational consequences.

Abstract: We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject
interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to
evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation.
Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and
concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated
with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic
synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -
commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains
were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -
founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real
customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind
spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -
relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism
toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false
positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by
missing negative historical experiences.
  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas
constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive
and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of
lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical
studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -
capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and
clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.

TL;DR: Using automatic differentiation (AD) with agent-based models (ABMs) enables efficient parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis, reducing computational burdens for complex systems like epidemics and financial markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABMs are computationally demanding and have numerous free parameters that hinder widespread adoption, especially for large-scale systems with thousands or millions of agents.

Method: Apply automatic differentiation techniques to ABMs to make simulator gradients available, enabling variational inference for efficient parameter calibration.

Result: Experiments on three ABMs (Axtell's firm model, Sugarscape, and SIR epidemiological model) show substantial performance improvements and computational savings.

Conclusion: AD significantly enhances the practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems by alleviating computational burdens.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up
interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems
of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even
millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding
and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has
significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate
that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these
computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator
become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as
calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables
variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our
experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational
savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;
and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the
practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.
