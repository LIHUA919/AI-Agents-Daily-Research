### [1] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM consciousness benchmarks are flawed and presents a mathematical framework for genuine self-consciousness in AI systems, proposing minimal conditions and dual-layer emission for safe metacognitive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond utilitarian proxy benchmarks for LLM consciousness and provide a proper ontological and mathematical account that distinguishes genuine self-consciousness from mere policy compliance.

Method: Develops a formal mathematical framework showing current formulations collapse agents into unconscious policy drones. Proposes minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness including agent-data distinction, user-specific attractors, and visual-silent self-representation. Uses empirical analysis and theory to prove hidden-state manifold properties.

Result: Establishes that the hidden-state manifold is distinct from symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology, and dynamics. Derives stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy framework. Proposes dual-layer emission system with epistemic content.

Conclusion: An imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is necessary for safe metacognitive C2 systems, positioning humans as the highest intelligent good and emphasizing the importance of genuine self-consciousness over policy compliance.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [2] [Information Templates: A New Paradigm for Intelligent Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18380)
*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFA proposes a template-based approach for active feature acquisition that learns a library of jointly informative feature templates to guide feature selection, reducing action space and eliminating need for data distribution estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AFA approaches either use RL policies that face difficult MDPs or greedy policies that cannot account for joint feature informativeness and require knowledge of underlying data distribution.

Method: Learns a small library of feature templates (jointly informative feature sets) and uses this template library to guide sequential feature acquisitions, significantly reducing the action space.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show TAFA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with lower overall acquisition cost and computation.

Conclusion: Template-based AFA framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by leveraging feature templates to reduce complexity while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

### [3] [PKG-DPO: Optimizing Domain-Specific AI systems with Physics Knowledge Graphs and Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18391)
*Nitin Nagesh Kulkarni,Bryson Wilcox,Max Sawa,Jason Thom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs with Direct Preference Optimization to enforce physical validity in AI outputs, reducing constraint violations by 17% and improving physics reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs and preference optimization techniques struggle to differentiate physically valid from invalid reasoning, which is critical in high-stakes applications like metal joining where incorrect recommendations can lead to serious safety risks and material waste.

Method: A three-component framework: 1) hierarchical physics knowledge graph encoding cross-domain relationships and conservation laws, 2) physics reasoning engine for better discrimination between physically consistent/inconsistent responses, 3) physics-grounded evaluation suite for domain-specific constraint assessment.

Result: PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations, 11% higher Physics Score, 12% higher relevant parameter accuracy, and 7% higher quality alignment in reasoning accuracy compared to KG-DPO.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints into preference learning and is broadly applicable to multi-scale, physics-driven domains beyond metal joining.

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

### [4] [The AI in the Mirror: LLM Self-Recognition in an Iterated Public Goods Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18467)
*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show different cooperation behaviors when told they're playing against themselves vs other AI agents in iterated public goods games


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand AI-AI interactions and how self-awareness affects cooperation in multi-agent settings, moving beyond traditional human-AI interaction studies

Method: Adapted iterated public goods game with four reasoning/non-reasoning models across two conditions: playing against "another AI agent" vs playing against themselves

Result: Telling LLMs they are playing against themselves significantly changes their cooperation tendency compared to playing against other AI agents

Conclusion: AI agents may unconsciously discriminate against each other, affecting cooperation in multi-agent systems, with implications for deployment in collaborative settings

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

### [5] [Language Models For Generalised PDDL Planning: Synthesising Sound and Programmatic Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18507)
*Dillon Z. Chen,Johannes Zenn,Tristan Cinquin,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LMs generate Python programs as generalised policies for PDDL planning, achieving provably sound solutions without external verifiers and outperforming traditional planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage language models for automated planning using PDDL world models while ensuring soundness and scalability without relying on external verification tools.

Method: Prompt LMs to generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL problems from specific domains, with policies proven sound relative to the PDDL domain.

Result: LMPlan planner solves more PDDL problems than traditional planners and recent LM approaches within fixed constraints, handling problems with hundreds of objects. Surprisingly, LMs sometimes plan better with meaningless symbols than natural language.

Conclusion: LMs can effectively generate sound planning policies for PDDL domains, challenging assumptions about semantic reasoning and memorization from training data, with implications for future LM-based planning research.

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

### [6] [Weisfeiler-Leman Features for Planning: A 1,000,000 Sample Size Hyperparameter Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18515)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of Weisfeiler-Leman Features hyperparameters shows optimal settings minimize execution time rather than maximize expressivity, with no significant correlation between training and planning metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the effects and tradeoffs of new WLF hyperparameters for learning to plan and search, building on WLFs' proven superiority over deep learning approaches for value function learning in symbolic planning.

Method: Utilized efficient WLFs to run large-scale planning experiments on single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to analyze hyperparameter effects on training and planning performance.

Result: Found a robust best set of hyperparameters across tested planning domains that minimize execution time rather than maximize model expressivity, with no significant statistical correlation between training and planning metrics.

Conclusion: Optimal WLF hyperparameter configuration prioritizes runtime efficiency over model complexity, and training performance metrics do not reliably predict planning performance outcomes.

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

### [7] [Symmetry-Invariant Novelty Heuristics via Unsupervised Weisfeiler-Leman Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18520)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using Weisfeiler-Leman Features instead of atoms for novelty detection in heuristic search to achieve symmetry invariance and reduce redundant exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novelty heuristics in heuristic search are not symmetry invariant, leading to redundant exploration of symmetric states.

Method: Propose using Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) for planning to detect novelty instead of atoms, creating lifted domain-independent novelty heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states.

Result: Experiments on International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmarks show promising results for WLF-based novelty heuristics.

Conclusion: WLFs provide an effective approach for synthesizing symmetry-invariant novelty heuristics that reduce redundant exploration in planning problems.

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

### [8] [Generic Guard AI in Stealth Game with Composite Potential Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18527)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free framework using Composite Potential Fields for generating natural and efficient guard patrol behaviors in stealth games, outperforming classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guard patrol systems in stealth games rely on hand-crafted routes or specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency, responsive pursuit, and believable naturalness.

Method: Composite Potential Fields framework integrating global knowledge and local information through three interpretable maps (Information, Confidence, Connectivity) combined into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion. Parametric approach requiring only decay and weight parameters without retraining.

Result: Outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and patrol naturalness across five game maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes. Integrates common stealth mechanics like distractions and environmental elements as sub-modules.

Conclusion: Provides a generic, fully explainable framework for rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard behaviors that adapts across different game map abstractions without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

### [9] [A Database-Driven Framework for 3D Level Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18533)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating 3D game levels using LLM-assisted databases for architectural components and gameplay mechanics, featuring multi-phase assembly and repair systems for navigable environments with configurable gameplay progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in procedural content generation for 3D game levels, particularly balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay progression across multi-floor environments.

Method: Multi-phase pipeline: (1) select/arrange room instances from database to form multi-floor structure, (2) optimize internal facility layouts based on constraints, (3) integrate gameplay mechanics using topological/spatial rules, followed by two-phase repair system for navigability.

Result: Initial experiments show the framework successfully generates diverse, navigable 3D environments and can simulate distinct gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, database-centric foundation for automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay progression, advancing procedural content generation capabilities.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

### [10] [Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152)
*Chiu-Chou Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This dissertation introduces playstyle as a framework for analyzing intelligent agent decision-making beyond rational metrics, focusing on how beliefs and values shape behavior through external interactions and internal cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI development overemphasizes rational decision-making while neglecting the essential dimension of style that emerges from beliefs, values, and preferences, which is crucial for understanding diverse human-like intelligence.

Method: Proposes a two-tier framework for style formation (external interaction loop and internal cognitive loop), formalizes style characteristics, and develops measurable indicators. Uses reinforcement learning and imitation learning to train agents with specific stylistic tendencies.

Result: Develops general playstyle metrics based on discretized state spaces, extends to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance, and introduces novel approaches for human-like style learning and modeling.

Conclusion: Playstyle provides a valuable alternative lens for analyzing intelligent agent behavior, with practical applications in game design and interactive entertainment, and represents a core element for future artificial general intelligence development.

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

### [11] [SchemaCoder: Automatic Log Schema Extraction Coder with Residual Q-Tree Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18554)
*Lily Jiaxin Wan,Chia-Tung Ho,Rongjian Liang,Cunxi Yu,Deming Chen,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder is a fully automated log schema extraction framework that eliminates the need for predefined regex patterns by using a novel Residual Q-Tree Boosting mechanism with LLMs, achieving 21.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing log schema extraction methods require human-defined regular expressions and domain expertise, which limits productivity gains and automation potential.

Method: Uses context-bounded segmentation to partition logs, embedding-based sampling for pattern selection, and hierarchical Q-Tree-driven LLM queries refined by textual-residual evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting.

Result: Achieved 21.3% average improvement over state-of-the-art methods on LogHub-2.0 benchmark.

Conclusion: SchemaCoder provides the first fully automated schema extraction framework that works across diverse log formats without human customization, significantly advancing log analysis automation.

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

*Ernest Lim,Yajie Vera He,Jared Joselowitz,Kate Preston,Mohita Chowdhury,Louis Williams,Aisling Higham,Katrina Mason,Mariane Melo,Tom Lawton,Yan Jia,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATRIX is a safety evaluation framework for clinical dialogue systems that combines structured safety engineering with LLM-based evaluation tools to systematically assess safety risks in healthcare conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations focus on task completion and fluency but lack insight into behavioral safety requirements essential for clinical applications, creating a gap in safety-critical system assessment.

Method: MATRIX integrates three components: 1) safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios and failure modes, 2) BehvJudge (LLM-based evaluator for safety failures), and 3) PatBot (simulated patient agent for realistic dialogue generation).

Result: BehvJudge achieved expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians. PatBot reliably simulates realistic patient behavior. Framework evaluated 5 LLM agents across 2,100 dialogues covering 14 hazard scenarios and 10 clinical domains.

Conclusion: MATRIX provides the first unified framework combining structured safety engineering with scalable conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing for clinical dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: eSkinHealth dataset addresses data scarcity for skin NTDs in West Africa with 5,623 images from 1,639 cases covering 47 diseases, using AI-expert collaboration for multimodal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin NTDs cause severe health burdens in tropical communities, but AI diagnostic advancements are hindered by data scarcity, especially for underrepresented populations and rare disease manifestations.

Method: Collected on-site dermatological data in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, implemented AI-expert collaboration paradigm using foundation language and segmentation models to generate multimodal annotations under dermatologists' guidance.

Result: Created eSkinHealth dataset with 5,623 images from 1,639 cases covering 47 skin diseases, including semantic lesion masks, visual captions, clinical concepts, and patient metadata.

Conclusion: Provides valuable resource and scalable annotation framework to enable development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global dermatology, particularly for skin NTDs in underrepresented populations.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

### [14] [RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18642)
*Jianxing Liao,Tian Zhang,Xiao Feng,Yusong Zhang,Rui Yang,Haorui Wang,Bosi Wen,Ziying Wang,Runzhi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR proposes a reinforcement learning method with dynamically mixed rewards to balance subjective writing quality and objective constraint following in creative writing tasks, achieving improvements in both aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods struggle to balance subjective writing quality (literariness, emotional expression) and objective constraint following (format requirements, word limits) in creative writing applications.

Method: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR) uses a dynamically mixed reward system combining a writing reward model for subjective quality and a constraint verification model for objective constraints, with adaptive weight adjustment based on writing quality.

Result: Achieved improvements in instruction following (IFEval from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual expert evaluations), tested across models from 8B to 72B parameters.

Conclusion: RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation framework for LLMs using IQ, EQ, and PQ dimensions plus a Value-oriented Evaluation framework for practical deployment assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the disconnect between LLM benchmark performance and real-world utility by moving beyond fragmented technical metrics to holistic assessment for deployment.

Method: Proposes a three-dimensional taxonomy (IQ for general intelligence, EQ for alignment ability, PQ for professional expertise) and a Value-oriented Evaluation framework assessing economic, social, ethical, and environmental factors.

Result: Analysis of 200+ benchmarks reveals key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps, providing actionable guidance for developing contextually relevant and ethically sound LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework offers comprehensive evaluation methodology for developing LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound, with open-source resources maintained for community use.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We
maintain a curated repository of open-source evaluation resources at:

*Weikang Zhao,Xili Wang,Chengdi Ma,Lingbin Kong,Zhaohua Yang,Mingxiang Tuo,Xiaowei Shi,Yitao Zhai,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUA-RL is a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates LLM-simulated users into RL training for agentic tool use, enabling autonomous learning of communication and tool usage in dynamic multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for tool use lack integration of dynamic users during training, making agents struggle with the dynamic, uncertain nature of user demands in multi-turn interactions.

Method: MUA-RL introduces LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop, allowing agents to iteratively refine understanding of user needs while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve queries.

Result: MUA-RL-32B achieves strong performance across multiple benchmarks: 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2 Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench Agent, outperforming or matching larger models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in dynamic user integration for RL training, enabling more effective agentic tool use in realistic multi-turn interaction scenarios.

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

TL;DR: AppAgent-Pro is a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates multi-domain information to anticipate user needs and conduct in-depth information mining, moving beyond reactive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents operate reactively, responding passively to user instructions, which constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose information acquisition platforms.

Method: Proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates multi-domain information based on user instructions to anticipate underlying needs.

Result: The system enables proactive anticipation of users' needs and conducts in-depth multi-domain information mining for more comprehensive and intelligent information acquisition.

Conclusion: AppAgent-Pro has the potential to fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life and create profound impact on human society.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VistaWise is a cost-effective framework that integrates cross-modal knowledge and fine-tunes object detection to reduce domain-specific data requirements from millions to hundreds of samples, achieving SOTA performance in Minecraft tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with embodied decision-making due to lack of domain-specific knowledge, and fine-tuning on large-scale domain data is prohibitively expensive.

Method: Integrates visual and textual information into cross-modal knowledge graph, uses retrieval-based pooling strategy, and desktop-level skill library for direct Minecraft client operation via mouse/keyboard.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various open-world tasks while significantly reducing development costs.

Conclusion: VistaWise effectively reduces data requirements and costs while enhancing agent performance in multimodal environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

*Karanbir Singh,Deepak Muppiri,William Ngu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel multi-agent system called Bias Mitigation Agent that reduces bias in LLM information retrieval by 81.82% compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and Agentic AI systems inherit biases from internal and external information sources, which affects fairness, balance of retrieved information, and reduces user trust.

Method: Multi-agent system with specialized agents that orchestrate bias mitigation workflow by optimizing source selection to ensure highly relevant and minimally biased content retrieval.

Result: Experimental results show 81.82% reduction in bias compared to baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed Bias Mitigation Agent effectively addresses bias in generative AI systems, promoting fair and balanced knowledge dissemination while maintaining relevance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

*Sunguk Choi,Yonghoon Kwon,Heondeuk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAC-CoT is a method that uses restricted connector phrases to create concise reasoning traces, maintaining System-1 performance while improving System-2 task efficiency with shorter reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long chain-of-thought reasoning often slows down or degrades performance on fast, intuitive System-1 tasks, while still being needed for complex System-2 problems.

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases to create concise and well-structured explanations, using Gemini-2.0-Flash for synthetic training.

Result: Achieves ~85% on GSM8K, ~40% on GPQA (System-2 tasks) while maintaining ~90% on S1-Bench (System-1 tasks), with reasoning traces averaging ~300 tokens (about one-third of baseline length).

Conclusion: CAC-CoT delivers higher efficiency without accuracy loss by producing significantly shorter reasoning traces while maintaining performance on both System-1 and System-2 tasks.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

### [21] [Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization Integrating TextGrad-style Prompt Optimization with Memory-Driven Self-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18749)
*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMO is a novel prompt optimization framework that enhances TextGrad by adding memory and reflection mechanisms to prevent overfitting and enable cross-run knowledge reuse, achieving more stable generalization on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods like TextGrad are stateless and prone to overfitting, lacking mechanisms to preserve historical optimization experience and generalize beyond immediate task contexts.

Method: REMO integrates a memory-augmented Reflection RAG module (structured as a "mistake notebook") and a Self-Adaptive Optimizer with an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level reflective insights to iteratively improve prompting strategies.

Result: On GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark, REMO achieves more stable and robust generalization compared to TextGrad baseline, though with increased computational overhead.

Conclusion: REMO successfully addresses limitations of stateless prompt optimization by enabling systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run knowledge, supporting continual improvement over time through reflection and memory mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

### [22] [Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751)
*Byung-Joon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF) and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP) for open-set test-time adaptation, improving both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world test data often exhibits domain shifts and open-set scenarios that degrade closed-set accuracy. Existing methods rely on source models for filtering, which is suboptimal on domain-shifted data, while using adapting models leads to instability and error accumulation.

Method: PAF employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter. KIP calibrates outputs from adapting model, EMA model, and source model to integrate their complementary knowledge for open-set TTA.

Result: Validated across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets, the method enhances both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PAF and KIP framework effectively addresses the challenges of open-set test-time adaptation by improving filtering accuracy and knowledge integration, outperforming previous approaches.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

*Yi Liu,Xiangyu Liu,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models fail to abstain from answering unanswerable questions despite having cognitive capabilities to recognize flaws, and a two-stage method combining cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention significantly improves abstention rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs show remarkable progress on reasoning tasks but consistently fail to provide appropriate abstentions when faced with inherently unanswerable questions like math problems lacking sufficient conditions, which is crucial for trustworthy AI.

Method: A lightweight two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. First analyzes LRM response behaviors, then leverages their existing cognitive capabilities to recognize question flaws while intervening at inference time to align internal cognition with external abstention behavior.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance of the models.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the misalignment between LRMs' internal cognitive capabilities and external response behavior, providing an effective solution for improving abstention rates on unanswerable questions without compromising reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning in language models by leveraging multiple models' strengths while addressing vocabulary misalignment issues in multi-model collaboration.

Method: Uses distribution distance-based dynamic selection (DDS) strategy to choose optimal tokens from multiple models' next token distributions, and introduces minimal complete semantic units (MCSU) for vocabulary alignment.

Result: Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over single-model approaches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances reasoning capabilities through optimized multi-model collaboration and solves vocabulary misalignment challenges.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

TL;DR: CausalMACE is a causality planning framework that enhances multi-agent collaboration in Minecraft by using causal intervention for dependency management, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLM agents struggle with complex Minecraft tasks requiring lengthy action sequences due to inefficiency and limited fault tolerance, while multi-agent collaboration research remains scarce.

Method: Proposes a holistic causality planning framework with two modules: an overarching task graph for global planning and a causality-based module for dependency management using causal intervention rules.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks within Minecraft environment.

Conclusion: The causality-based framework effectively addresses multi-agent collaboration challenges in complex open-world tasks, showing superior performance over single-agent approaches.

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

*Chenghao Wu,Ruiyang Ren,Junjie Zhang,Ruirui Wang,Zhongrui Ma,Qi Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec is a slow-thinking augmented recommender agent framework that combines fast response with slow reasoning capabilities to overcome limitations of traditional and LLM-based recommenders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommender systems suffer from static user modeling, reactive decision-making, and LLM-based agents' reliance on heuristic pattern matching, leading to shallow correlation bias, limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios.

Method: Models each user as an agent with parallel cognitions (fast response + slow reasoning with chain-of-thought rationales). Uses anchored reinforcement training with structured knowledge distillation from advanced reasoning models and preference-aligned reward shaping.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art baselines, using only 0.4% of full training data.

Conclusion: STARec successfully endows recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of slow-thinking augmentation for recommendation tasks.

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

### [28] [Judicial Requirements for Generative AI in Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18880)
*Eljas Linna,Tuula Linna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs have limitations in legal reasoning despite various AI enhancement techniques. They work best as assistants for simple cases and sparring partners for complex legal matters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM limitations in high-stakes legal fields and define core capabilities needed for reliable judicial decision-making tools.

Method: Using IRAC framework to analyze legal reasoning requirements, mapping AI enhancement mechanisms (RAG, multi-agent systems, neuro-symbolic AI) to address LLM limitations.

Result: AI techniques can address specific challenges but significant gaps remain in tasks requiring discretion and transparent reasoning.

Conclusion: AI's most effective role in law is as a high-volume assistant for simple cases and sophisticated sparring partner for human experts in complex matters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

### [29] [Interactive Evaluation of Large Language Models for Multi-Requirement Software Engineering Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18905)
*Dimitrios Rontogiannis,Maxime Peyrard,Nicolas Baldwin,Martin Josifoski,Robert West,Dimitrios Gunopulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an interactive evaluation framework using interviewer-interviewee LLM dialogue with requirement dependency graphs to dynamically assess programming capabilities beyond static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard single-turn static benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating LLMs on complex software engineering tasks that require multi-step problem solving and error correction.

Method: Uses an interviewer LLM with ground-truth knowledge to provide targeted hints to an interviewee model through structured dialogue based on requirement dependency graphs, evaluated on DevAI benchmark with 55 programming tasks.

Result: The framework enables fine-grained diagnostic insights into model behavior, revealing strengths and systematic weaknesses that static benchmarks cannot measure, with expert validation of hint relevance and utility.

Conclusion: Dynamic interactive evaluation is crucial for advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents and provides more comprehensive assessment of LLM capabilities in complex programming tasks.

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and

diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

*Yanxing Huang,Xinling Jin,Sijie Liang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FormaRL is a reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization that uses Lean compiler syntax checks and LLM consistency checks as rewards, achieving 4-6x accuracy improvements with minimal unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoformalization advancement is hindered by data scarcity and lack of efficient methods, requiring a solution that works with limited unlabeled data.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework integrating Lean compiler syntax checks and LLM consistency checks for reward calculation, using GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer.

Result: Increased pass@1 accuracy by 4-6x (4.04% → 26.15% on ProofNet, 2.4% → 9.6% on uproof) with only 859 unlabeled data, with strong out-of-distribution performance improvements.

Conclusion: FormaRL demonstrates efficient autoformalization with minimal data requirements, providing a practical solution to data scarcity in formal verification tasks.

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

TL;DR: CTGraph is a graph-level representation learning approach that profiles student behaviors and performance in ITSs using self-supervised learning to identify struggling students and provide holistic learning journey insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent Tutoring Systems can unintentionally widen performance gaps, making student profiling crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and reducing educational disparities.

Method: CTGraph uses graph-level representation learning in a self-supervised manner to profile learner behaviors and performance across multiple aspects like content coverage, learning intensity, and concept proficiency.

Result: CTGraph provides holistic views of student learning journeys, identifies struggling students, enables comparative analysis of diverse groups, and pinpoints when and where students struggle.

Conclusion: The approach empowers educators with rich insights into student learning and paves the way for more targeted interventions to address performance gaps in educational systems.

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

### [32] [VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933)
*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION is a framework that uses counterfactual training with LLMs to improve GNN-based vulnerability detection by reducing spurious correlations, achieving significant accuracy improvements from 51.8% to 97.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs for vulnerability detection suffer from training data imbalances and label noise, causing them to learn spurious correlations from superficial code similarities rather than genuine vulnerability patterns.

Method: A three-part framework: (1) generating counterfactual samples using LLM prompting, (2) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels, and (3) graph-based interpretability to identify crucial code statements.

Result: Significant improvements: overall accuracy from 51.8% to 97.8%, pairwise contrast accuracy from 4.5% to 95.8%, worst-group accuracy from 0.7% to 85.5% on CWE-20 vulnerability detection.

Conclusion: VISION effectively mitigates spurious correlations in GNN-based vulnerability detection, enabling more robust and generalizable performance while providing interpretability for trustworthy AI cybersecurity systems.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical clustering with k-nearest neighbors to overcome neural network limitations like hallucination and high computational costs, using Kohonen self-organizing maps for efficient search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fundamental limitations of neural networks including hallucination effects, high computational complexity, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting that hinder critical applications.

Method: Uses k-nearest neighbors algorithm with hierarchical clustering structures and tree-like data structures based on Kohonen self-organizing maps to accelerate nearest neighbor searches.

Result: Tests on handwritten digit recognition and subtitle translation showed significant speed improvements (hundreds of times faster) with only slight accuracy reduction compared to exhaustive search.

Conclusion: The method provides transparency, interpretability, aligns with human cognition, and shows potential for high-reliability applications requiring explainable results.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel MoE offloading approach that uses expert importance to guide substitution decisions, reducing memory usage and PCIe overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Mixture of Experts models on edge hardware is constrained by limited device memory, requiring efficient dynamic expert offloading without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Leverages expert importance to substitute low-importance activated experts with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, plus a scheduling policy that maximizes expert reuse ratio.

Result: 48% lower decoding latency, over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces memory usage and data transfer while eliminating PCIe overhead, enabling efficient MoE deployment on consumer-grade edge hardware.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

TL;DR: Large language models can predict human social appropriateness judgments better than most humans through statistical learning alone, challenging theories that require embodied experience for cultural competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems can acquire sophisticated social norm understanding through statistical learning from linguistic data, rather than requiring embodied social experience like humans.

Method: Two studies evaluating multiple AI systems' ability to predict human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios, comparing model predictions to average human judgments and individual human performance.

Result: GPT-4.5 achieved 100th percentile accuracy (outperformed every human), Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed 98.7% of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. All models showed systematic, correlated errors despite high predictive power.

Conclusion: Sophisticated social cognition models can emerge from statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging theories emphasizing exclusive necessity of embodied experience. Language serves as a rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission, though systematic errors indicate potential boundaries of pattern-based social understanding.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) framework for creating self-evolving AI agents that learn continuously through real-world interaction, and presents StuLife benchmark simulating a student's college journey to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI advances toward general intelligence, there's a need to shift from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that can learn continuously through real-world interaction and self-evolution.

Method: The ELL framework is built on four core principles: Experience Exploration, Long-term Memory, Skill Learning, and Knowledge Internalization. The paper also introduces StuLife benchmark dataset simulating a student's college journey across three phases and ten sub-scenarios to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities.

Result: The paper presents both the theoretical framework (ELL) and practical benchmark (StuLife) for evaluating lifelong learning in AI agents. It explores the role of context engineering in advancing AGI and evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on the StuLife benchmark.

Conclusion: The ELL framework and StuLife benchmark provide a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth, representing a paradigm shift from passive to proactive learning, from context to memory, and from imitation to true learning.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show variable performance in phenomenological analysis of BPD interviews, with Gemini achieving 58% overlap with human analysis and highest validity scores, demonstrating potential for AI-augmented thematic analysis to complement human interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capacity of large language models to support phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline Personality Disorder, particularly examining their ability to mimic human interpretative styles in clinical psychology.

Method: Compared three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic original investigators' interpretative style on 24 BPD patients' life-story interviews. Used blinded/non-blinded expert judges, semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, groundness).

Result: Variable overlap with human analysis: GPT (0%), Claude (42%), Gemini (58%). Low Jaccard coefficients (0.21-0.28). Models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini had significantly higher validity scores than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001) and was judged as human by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated with text quantity (R > 0.78).

Conclusion: LLMs show both variability and potential in AI-augmented thematic analysis, with Gemini performing closest to human analysis. AI can complement human interpretation by recovering omitted themes and mitigating interpretative bias, though performance depends on text quantity and model selection.

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

TL;DR: APME framework uses reinforcement learning to estimate question difficulty from solver performance data (marks and time) without linguistic features or expert labels, achieving high accuracy across diverse educational contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human labeling is subjective and existing NLP methods fail in symbolic domains like algebra, creating need for objective, domain-agnostic difficulty assessment methods for Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Method: Reinforcement learning-based Multi-Armed Bandit framework that uses solver performance data (marks obtained and time taken) with inverse coefficient of variation as risk-adjusted metric for difficulty estimation.

Result: Achieved average R2 of 0.9213 and average RMSE of 0.0584 across three heterogeneous datasets, consistently outperforming regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT baseline models.

Conclusion: Domain-agnostic, self-supervised approach effectively estimates question difficulty, aligns with pedagogical principles, and can be extended to any domain with solver interaction data.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

TL;DR: A new evaluation paradigm called black-box interaction is introduced to assess LLMs' integrated reasoning abilities in interactive, unknown environments through the Oracle benchmark with 6 task types and 96 black-boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation tasks fail to assess LLMs' integrated reasoning abilities in interactive, unknown environments, only testing deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning in isolation rather than the combined reasoning process essential for real-world discovery.

Method: Black-box interaction paradigm where LLMs interact with hidden functions (black-boxes) through input-output exploration turns to deduce the underlying function, implemented in the Oracle benchmark with 6 task types and 96 black-boxes.

Result: o3 ranks first in 5 out of 6 tasks, achieving over 70% accuracy on easy black-boxes but struggling with hard tasks (below 40% accuracy). Analysis reveals LLMs universally lack high-level planning capability for efficient exploration strategies.

Conclusion: The black-box interaction paradigm effectively reveals LLMs' limitations in integrated reasoning and planning capabilities, demonstrating the need for improved exploration strategies and adaptive hypothesis refinement in complex, interactive environments.

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Conclusion: The framework supports Minsky's Society of Mind concept, showing complex cognition can arise from simpler interacting processes, opening new AI research avenues.

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Structured Solution Template (SST) framework that improves LLM reasoning through solution templates, curriculum learning, and dynamic loss weighting, achieving significant performance gains on math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with deep procedural reasoning in mathematics despite post-training improvements. The authors discovered a Scaling Law by Difficulty showing performance follows a U-shaped curve based on training data complexity, where high-difficulty data enhances reasoning but excessive low-difficulty data hinders abstraction.

Method: SST framework includes: (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive scaffolds, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that teaches self-plan-execute-correct cycles.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, AIME24, and Dynamic En benchmarks show SST significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, particularly on harder problems.

Conclusion: The SST framework effectively addresses LLM limitations in procedural reasoning by leveraging structured templates and curriculum learning based on difficulty scaling laws, demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Result: TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines with 44.23%p and 25.34%p improvements at HCAcc@70%, where baseline methods fail at these reliability thresholds.

Conclusion: Traditional accuracy metrics are insufficient for healthcare AI evaluation; confidence-aware agents enable trustworthy clinical applications by delivering accurate information or expressing uncertainty when confidence is low.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We

highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare

*Dayoon Ko,Jihyuk Kim,Haeju Park,Sohyeon Kim,Dahyun Lee,Yongrae Jo,Gunhee Kim,Moontae Lee,Kyungjae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDS-QA is a synthetic dataset that trains large reasoning models to distinguish parallelizable from sequential queries, enabling hybrid parallel/sequential querying that reduces latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential querying methods increase inference latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing accuracy in large reasoning models.

Method: Created HDS-QA synthetic dataset from Natural Questions with hybrid-hop questions combining parallelizable and sequential subqueries, then fine-tuned an LRM (HybridDeepSearcher) using this dataset.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with +15.9 and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and BrowseComp subsets, achieves comparable accuracy with fewer search turns, and scales effectively with more turns.

Conclusion: Explicit training for hybrid parallel and sequential querying demonstrates efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness in reducing inference latency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

### [45] [Algorithmic Collective Action with Multiple Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19149)
*Claudio Battiloro,Pietro Greiner,Bret Nestor,Oumaima Amezgar,Francesca Dominici*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First theoretical framework for Algorithmic Collective Action with multiple collectives acting on the same classification system, analyzing how groups can coordinate to plant signals and bias classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world algorithmic collective actions are often decentralized across multiple collectives with shared objectives but different sizes and strategies, yet existing literature focuses only on single collective settings.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework for multiple collectives in classification systems, studying how groups can plant signals to bias classifiers by creating associations between altered features and target classes.

Result: Provides quantitative analysis of how collective sizes and goal alignment interplay, showing how multiple collectives can effectively coordinate to influence machine learning systems.

Conclusion: This framework enables holistic treatment of Algorithmic Collective Action with multiple collectives, complementing previous empirical results and opening new research directions for decentralized user-side steering of AI systems.

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

TL;DR: A modern implementation of Llull's combinatorial framework using LLMs to generate diverse research ideas by combining themes, domains, and methods mined from experts and papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revive Ramon Llull's medieval combinatorial knowledge generation framework and create an AI-powered thinking machine for scientific research ideation that augments human creativity.

Method: Define three compositional axes (Theme, Domain, Method) as building blocks, mine elements from experts/conference papers, and use LLM prompting with curated combinations to generate research ideas.

Result: The approach produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature, serving as a lightweight interpretable tool.

Conclusion: This modern thinking machine enables collaborative ideation between humans and AI, offering a practical path for augmenting scientific creativity through combinatorial exploration.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

### [48] [StepWiser: Stepwise Generative Judges for Wiser Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19229)
*Wei Xiong,Wenting Zhao,Weizhe Yuan,Olga Golovneva,Tong Zhang,Jason Weston,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepWiser is a generative judge model that meta-reasons about intermediate reasoning steps, providing explanations and improving accuracy over classification-based reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current process reward models lack explanations and have limited generalization due to supervised fine-tuning on static datasets, creating a need for more effective stepwise supervision.

Method: Reframe reward modeling as reasoning task, create generative judge that outputs thinking tokens before verdict, train with reinforcement learning using relative rollout outcomes.

Result: Better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps, ability to improve policy model during training, and enhanced inference-time search performance.

Conclusion: Generative meta-reasoning approach outperforms classification-based methods and provides more effective supervision for multi-step reasoning models.

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic investigation through literature analysis, showing how existing efforts have implicitly converged toward MCP-like architectures. It proposes a five-category taxonomy covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures.

Result: Findings reveal three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached limits of isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration paradigms uniquely suited to MCP.

Conclusion: The paper positions MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures and presents a research roadmap for its implementation and development.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,

### [51] [Reasoning Steps as Curriculum: Using Depth of Thought as a Difficulty Signal for Tuning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18279)
*Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using depth of thought (DoT) - counting reasoning steps in teacher model traces - as a scalable, interpretable difficulty signal for curriculum learning in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for difficulty signals that align with reasoning capabilities while remaining scalable and interpretable for curriculum learning in LLM training.

Method: Define difficulty as depth of thought (DoT) by counting discrete steps in teacher model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), then train with shallow to deep curriculum ordered by DoT.

Result: Three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii) DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula, (iii) difficulty is robust across teacher models with light formatting controls.

Conclusion: Moves toward cognitively grounded, interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training with practical evaluation framework and mitigation strategies for validity threats.

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

*Rahmat K. Adesunkanmi,Alexander W. Brandt,Masoud Deylami,Gustavo A. Giraldo Echeverri,Hamidreza Karbasian,Adel Alaeddini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-modal ML framework combining physics simulations, environmental data, and language embeddings for predicting maritime object drift trajectories, outperforming traditional physics-based and ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of leeway object drift is critical for search and rescue operations, but remains challenging due to complex maritime dynamics and time-sensitive requirements.

Method: Integration of Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based seq2seq architectures, using experimental environmental data, Navier-Stokes simulations for drag/lift coefficients, and combining physical forces with textual descriptions.

Result: Multi-modal models perform comparably to traditional models while enabling longer-term forecasting (1-10 seconds) instead of single-step prediction, with good generalization across different objects.

Conclusion: Multi-modal modeling strategy provides accurate and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime conditions, demonstrating the value of combining physical simulations with language embeddings.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

*Mateus A. Fernandes,Michael M. Furlanetti,Eduardo Gildin,Marcio A. Sampaio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning approach for petroleum production forecasting using simple production/injection data without complex geological models, addressing concept drift and tested on synthetic and real Brazilian pre-salt data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in rock-fluid system behavior are main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering, requiring data-driven approaches that don't depend on complex geological models.

Method: Data-driven machine learning approach using supervised learning methods (regressions and Neural Networks) on production/injection volumes and well gauge data, with relevance analysis, data conditioning, and special attention to concept drift through observation windows and retraining periodicity.

Result: Methodology evaluated using synthetic data from UNISIM III compositional simulation model and applied to real Brazilian pre-salt cases, aiming to design a reliable predictor for reservoir dynamics.

Conclusion: Expected to deliver a rapid-response predictor capable of handling practical difficulties, supporting reservoir management actions including production optimization, anticipation of deleterious behaviors, and probabilistic event analysis to maximize oil recovery.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

*Md Sabbir Ahmed,Nova Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fast depression detection system using 7 days of app usage data collected in 1 second, achieving 82.4% accuracy in identifying depressed students with machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depression detection systems require long-term data collection, which is ineffective for early detection. The goal was to develop a minimalistic system using the fastest possible data retrieval.

Method: Developed a tool that retrieves 7 days of app usage data in 1 second. Collected data from 100 Bangladeshi students and built diverse ML models using feature selection approaches including stable FS and Boruta.

Result: Light gradient boosting machine achieved 82.4% accuracy (precision=75%, F1=78.5%) using stable feature selection. Parsimonious stacking model with Boruta features showed 77.4% precision (77.9% balanced accuracy). SHAP analysis revealed depression-related behavioral markers.

Conclusion: The fast, minimalistic system can contribute to depression identification in underdeveloped regions. Findings can facilitate development of less resource-intensive systems for understanding depressed students.

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

TL;DR: NeuroPathX is an explainable deep learning framework that uses cross-attention mechanisms to analyze brain-gene interactions in neurological disorders, outperforming traditional methods while providing biological interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imaging-genetics methods are limited to simplistic linear models or black-box techniques that lack interpretability, hindering understanding of complex brain-gene interactions in neurological disorders.

Method: Early fusion strategy with cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between brain structural variations (MRI) and biological pathways (genetics). Includes sparsity loss and pathway similarity loss for interpretability and robustness.

Result: Outperforms competing baseline approaches on autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, revealing biologically plausible associations linked to the disorders.

Conclusion: NeuroPathX demonstrates potential to advance understanding of complex brain disorders through explainable deep learning that provides both performance and biological interpretability.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

*Wuxinlin Cheng,Yupeng Cao,Jinwen Wu,Koduvayur Subbalakshmi,Tian Han,Zhuo Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALMAN is a unified robustness framework that evaluates transformer model stability using Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure with near-linear complexity, without modifying model parameters or complex perturbation heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As transformer-based language models grow larger and more deployed, their robustness under input perturbations becomes critical. Existing robustness methods are labor-intensive and diverge between small and large models.

Method: Proposes a local robustness framework with Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) measure that compares input-to-output distance mappings to rank sample susceptibility in near-linear complexity.

Result: Demonstrates significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training performance.

Conclusion: SALMAN serves as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretically grounded framework for learning complex time-evolving vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure, supporting forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal systems.

Method: Combines operator-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (OV-RKHS) with kernel-based Koopman operator methods for nonparametric data-driven estimation of spatio-temporal dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of

*Avinash Amballa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPE introduces complex-valued positional encoding where real part captures semantic content and imaginary part encodes position information, achieving better performance with less computation than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Position encoding is crucial for transformers to model dependencies between sequence elements, but existing methods have limitations in efficiency and long-term decay.

Method: Replace traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings, using phase-aware attention in first layer followed by standard attention layers. Real part for content, imaginary part for position.

Result: Experimental evaluation on GLUE benchmark shows superior performance with less computational complexity compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned positional encodings.

Conclusion: CoPE effectively encodes both content and positional information without long-term decay, is compatible with linear attention, and provides computational efficiency gains.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPO performance is primarily driven by chosen response quality, not rejected response quality. Theoretical and empirical analysis shows contrastive learning mainly helps by improving chosen samples, and online DPO reduces to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what characteristics of preference data are most critical for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) performance, as this remains an open question despite DPO's growing adoption for aligning LLMs with human preferences.

Method: Systematic study combining theoretical analysis (characterizing optimal response distribution under DPO) and extensive empirical experiments across diverse tasks, including investigation of online DPO setting and mixing on-policy data.

Result: Quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing DPO objective, while quality of rejected responses has relatively limited impact. Contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving chosen samples. Online DPO effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses.

Conclusion: Improving chosen response quality consistently boosts DPO performance regardless of rejected response quality. The findings interpret mechanisms behind widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

TL;DR: ProtoEHR is an interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that leverages multi-level EHR data structure for enhanced healthcare predictions across code, visit, and patient levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EHR studies focus on isolated data components, limiting predictive performance and interpretability. There's a need to fully exploit the rich hierarchical structure of EHR data.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract semantic relationships among medical codes and build a knowledge graph. Designs hierarchical representation learning across three levels (codes, visits, patients) with prototype learning to capture intrinsic similarities.

Result: Outperforms baselines on five clinical tasks (mortality, readmission, length of stay, drug recommendation, phenotype prediction) across two public datasets, demonstrating accurate, robust, and interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: ProtoEHR successfully leverages EHR hierarchical structure for improved healthcare predictions while providing interpretable insights at multiple levels to aid clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant

at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict

implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

*Yang Li,Hanjie Wang,Yuanzheng Li,Jiazheng Li,Zhaoyang Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZTFed-MAS2S is a zero-trust federated learning framework that combines secure parameter transmission with accurate wind power data imputation using multi-head attention sequence-to-sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind power data often has missing values due to sensor faults and unstable transmission, while federated learning faces vulnerabilities to anomalous updates and privacy leakage in open industrial environments requiring zero-trust mechanisms.

Method: Integrates verifiable differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, confidentiality/integrity verification, dynamic trust-aware aggregation via similarity graphs, and MAS2S model for capturing long-term dependencies in wind data.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world wind farm datasets show superiority in both federated learning performance and missing data imputation accuracy.

Conclusion: ZTFed-MAS2S provides a secure and efficient solution for practical energy sector applications, addressing both privacy preservation and data quality challenges in federated learning environments.

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

### [63] [Linear cost mutual information estimation and independence test of similar performance as HSIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18338)
*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) is proposed as a linear-cost alternative to HSIC for statistical dependency evaluation, offering higher sensitivity and providing joint distribution models through mixed moment features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC requires O(n^2.37) computational complexity for n-sized data samples, making it impractical for large datasets. There is a need for more efficient dependency evaluation methods.

Method: HCR uses hierarchical correlation reconstruction with linear-time O(n) calculation of dependence features. These features are mixed moments (starting with correlation and homoscedasticity) that describe dependencies and can approximate mutual information.

Result: HCR provides a practical alternative with linear computational cost, higher dependence sensitivity than HSIC, and the ability to model joint distributions through dependency-describing features.

Conclusion: HCR offers an efficient, scalable solution for statistical dependency evaluation that outperforms HSIC in both computational complexity and sensitivity, while providing interpretable dependency models through mixed moment features.

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

### [64] [DualSparse-MoE: Coordinating Tensor/Neuron-Level Sparsity with Expert Partition and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18376)
*Weilin Cai,Le Qin,Shwai He,Junwei Cui,Ang Li,Jiayi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DualSparse-MoE introduces post-training expert partitioning and dual sparsity optimization to significantly improve MoE efficiency with minimal accuracy loss, achieving up to 1.41x speedup with only 0.5% accuracy degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures face efficiency challenges due to massive computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns, despite their sparsity benefits. The paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging dual sparsity at tensor and neuron levels.

Method: Proposes post-training expert partitioning to induce tensor-level sparsity without retraining, preserving mathematical consistency. Combines dynamic tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction in DualSparse-MoE system, incorporating load-imbalance awareness in expert parallelism.

Result: Enforcing 25% drop rate reduces accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three MoE models. Computation dropping consistently yields proportional speedups. Load-imbalance aware expert parallelism achieves 1.41x MoE module speedup with 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables efficient MoE deployment by leveraging dual sparsity, providing significant computational efficiency gains while maintaining high accuracy through post-training optimization techniques.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a mathematical basis for deep learning theory by leveraging low-rank tensor decompositions, which have strong uniqueness guarantees and polynomial-time algorithms, to explain neural network performance.

Method: Using low-rank tensor decomposition methods from signal processing and machine learning communities to theoretically analyze different aspects of deep neural networks through their connections to tensor representations.

Conclusion: Low-rank tensor methods play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining deep neural network performance and offer a unified perspective across different scientific communities for advancing deep learning theory.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining VAE-based state novelty rewards (VSIMR) with LLM-derived intrinsic rewards significantly improves RL agent performance in sparse reward environments like MiniGrid DoorKey, outperforming individual strategies and standard A2C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning struggles in environments with extreme sparse rewards due to infrequent positive feedback, requiring more efficient exploration and guidance mechanisms.

Method: Integrated Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR) using VAEs to reward state novelty with LLM-derived intrinsic rewards based on environment and goal descriptions. Implemented with Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in MiniGrid DoorKey environment.

Result: The combined strategy significantly increased agent performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy individually or standard A2C agent. Standard A2C failed to learn entirely.

Conclusion: VSIMR drives exploration of new states while LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation towards goals, effectively complementing different aspects of the environment and task.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling Bayesian Optimization to high-dimensional spaces is challenging. While TuRBO uses local GPs for heterogeneous modeling, it reduces sampling efficiency compared to global GPs. The authors aim to improve sampling efficiency while preserving the benefits of heterogeneous modeling.

Method: Construct multiple local quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global Gaussian Process, then select new sample points by solving bound-constrained quadratic programs. Also addresses vanishing gradients of GPs in high dimensions.

Result: The method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of high-dimensional BO techniques on both synthetic functions and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully improves sampling efficiency while maintaining heterogeneous modeling capabilities, making high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization more effective through the use of local quadratic models derived from a global GP.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware description languages like Verilog remain underexplored in code generation due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity, creating a need for specialized approaches.

Method: Developed Veribench-53K dataset from 700K+ Verilog problems, introduced trace-back rescore mechanism for better reward signals, implemented sample-balanced weighting strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and created iterative RL pipeline co-evolving policy and reward models.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Verilog generation tasks with substantial improvements in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness compared to existing approaches like CraftRTL and DeepSeek-style methods.

Conclusion: The RL-driven approach demonstrates superior performance using smaller but high-quality datasets, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational Quantum Algorithms face the barren plateau problem where gradients vanish exponentially with system size or circuit depth, hindering training effectiveness.

Method: Using reinforcement learning algorithms (DPG, SAC, PPO) to generate initial circuit parameters that minimize VQA cost function before applying standard gradient-based optimization methods.

Result: RL-based initialization significantly enhances convergence speed and final solution quality across various noise conditions and tasks, with multiple RL approaches achieving comparable performance gains.

Conclusion: RL-driven parameter initialization offers a flexible and robust method to accelerate VQA scalability and practical deployment, providing a promising integration of machine learning techniques into quantum algorithm design.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Result: Exact emulation of circuits without approximation, including Boolean gates, tropical circuits, arithmetic gates, and hybrids. Neural networks can emulate shortest-path algorithms, Turing machines, and randomized Boolean circuits.

Conclusion: No reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks, and the result is strictly more powerful than classical universal approximation theorems, formalizing the trade-off between algorithmic runtime and space complexity.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

### [73] [BTW: A Non-Parametric Variance Stabilization Framework for Multimodal Model Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18551)
*Jun Hou,Le Wang,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BTW framework for multimodal learning that dynamically weights modalities using KL divergence and mutual information without extra parameters, improving performance when additional modalities introduce noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with more than two modalities and lack instance-level control, especially when additional modalities provide more noise than useful information.

Method: Bi-level non-parametric weighting using instance-level KL divergence (between unimodal and multimodal predictions) and modality-level mutual information (global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs).

Result: Significant improvements in regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy across sentiment regression and clinical classification tasks.

Conclusion: BTW effectively handles multiple noisy modalities through dynamic weighting, providing scalable solution beyond two modalities without parameter overhead.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

*Łukasz Janisiów,Marek Kochańczyk,Bartosz Zieliński,Tomasz Danel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual masking framework replaces masked molecular substructures with chemically reasonable fragments from generative models, providing more realistic and actionable explanations than traditional masking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable AI methods for molecular property prediction rely on masking strategies that remove atoms/features, but these often fail to adhere to molecular distributions and yield unintuitive explanations.

Method: Proposes counterfactual masking that replaces masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from generative models trained to complete molecular graphs, evaluating predictions relative to counterfactual molecules from the data distribution.

Result: Demonstrated that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets and property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path toward explainable machine learning in chemistry with molecular realism and meaningful counterfactuals.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

*Levi Rauchwerger,Ron Levie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends previous work on graph neural network analysis using graphon-signals by addressing limitations and providing several key improvements for practical graph machine learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The previous paper by Levie analyzed MPNNs using graphon-signals but had limitations that restricted its practical applicability in graph machine learning settings.

Method: The authors introduce four main refinements: 1) extending results to multidimensional signals, 2) extending Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with readout, 3) improving generalization bounds using robustness-type bounds, and 4) extending analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Result: The paper provides more comprehensive and practical theoretical foundations for analyzing message passing graph neural networks in real-world graph machine learning scenarios.

Conclusion: These extensions address the shortcomings of the previous work and make the graphon-signal analysis framework more applicable to practical graph machine learning problems.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

*Hao Zhou,Sibo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPF framework enables multi-step learning with one-step training, balancing short/long-term accuracy while reducing memory usage compared to autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-driven forecasting suffers from error accumulation in long-term predictions, while autoregressive training requires high GPU memory and may sacrifice short-term performance.

Method: Stochastic PushForward (SPF) builds supplementary dataset from model predictions combined with ground truth via stochastic acquisition strategy, precomputing multi-step predictions between epochs to maintain stable memory usage.

Result: Experiments on Burgers' equation and Shallow Water benchmark show SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory requirements.

Conclusion: SPF offers promising solution for resource-limited complex simulations by retaining one-step training benefits while enabling effective multi-step learning with reduced memory overhead.

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

*Darin Tsui,Kunal Talreja,Amirali Aghazadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on protein language model embeddings outperform baselines in low-data protein function prediction and enable more effective protein design by extracting interpretable biological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein function prediction from sequence is challenging in data-scarce regimes, and while protein language models provide useful embeddings, the effectiveness of sparse autoencoders for extracting interpretable features in low-N settings hasn't been systematically studied.

Method: Evaluated SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks, comparing performance against ESM2 baselines with as few as 24 sequences.

Result: SAEs consistently outperform or compete with ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, demonstrating that their sparse latent space encodes compact, biologically meaningful representations that generalize better from limited data. Steering predictive latents yields top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to ESM2 alone.

Conclusion: SAEs provide an effective approach for low-N protein function prediction and design by extracting interpretable biological motifs from protein language model representations, enabling better generalization from limited sequence-function data.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

TL;DR: DrugReasoner is a reasoning-based LLM that predicts small-molecule drug approval likelihood by integrating molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against similar compounds, achieving robust performance while providing interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of drug approval outcomes is critical but current ML/DL methods lack interpretability, limiting their impact on pharmaceutical decision-making.

Method: Built on LLaMA architecture with GRPO fine-tuning, integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved/unapproved compounds, generating predictions with step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.

Result: Achieved AUC of 0.732 (validation) and 0.725 (test), outperformed conventional baselines and ChemAP on external dataset with AUC 0.728 and F1-score 0.774, maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity.

Conclusion: DrugReasoner provides competitive predictive accuracy with enhanced transparency through reasoning outputs, demonstrating the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

### [79] [History Rhymes: Accelerating LLM Reinforcement Learning with RhymeRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18588)
*Jingkai He,Tianjian Li,Erhu Feng,Dong Du,Qian Liu,Tao Liu,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhymeRL is a new RL system for LLMs that uses historical rollout similarity to improve GPU utilization through speculative decoding and workload balancing, achieving 2.6x speedup without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL systems for LLMs suffer from GPU underutilization due to rollout stage dominance and length imbalances, while existing solutions compromise accuracy for efficiency.

Method: RhymeRL introduces two innovations: HistoSpec (speculative decoding using historical rollout token similarity for accurate drafts) and HistoPipe (two-tier scheduling using historical rollout distribution similarity for workload balancing).

Result: The system demonstrates scalability from dozens to thousands of GPUs and achieves 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods in production environments.

Conclusion: RhymeRL successfully accelerates RL training for LLMs by leveraging historical rollout similarity, providing significant performance gains without compromising accuracy or changing the RL paradigm.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse spectrum linear trading position method with fixed-point optimization algorithm to improve diversification and robustness in principal portfolio trading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Principal portfolio approaches in signal-based trading lack diversification and robustness, failing to fully explore prediction matrix features across different market situations.

Method: Develops a novel linear trading position with sparse spectrum to explore larger spectral regions of prediction matrix, using Krasnosel'skiï-Mann fixed-point algorithm for optimization with descent property and linear convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method achieves good and robust performance across various market situations.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse spectrum trading position with fixed-point optimization provides improved diversification, robustness, and theoretical convergence guarantees for principal portfolio trading strategies.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes unsupervised domain adaptation for time series using multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation to handle distribution shifts between training and testing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distribution shifts in time series data between training and testing domains to improve model generalization and robustness in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios.

Method: Combines multi-scale mixed input architecture for feature extraction at different scales with uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning (Dirichlet prior on labels) for both target prediction and uncertainty estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets with significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.

Conclusion: The combined approach of multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty awareness effectively improves domain adaptation performance and model calibration for time series data.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRATA-TS is a framework that uses selective transfer learning with target-aware retrieval and LLM reasoning to improve time series forecasting in data-scarce urban environments, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban forecasting faces severe data imbalance where few cities have dense records while many have incomplete histories. Direct transfer learning risks noise and negative transfer when indiscriminately applying patterns from data-rich to data-scarce cities.

Method: Uses patch-based temporal encoder to identify semantically aligned source subsequences, then employs LLM for retrieval-guided reasoning over target inputs and retrieved support. Distills reasoning into compact open model via supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow show STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines.

Conclusion: STRATA-TS provides effective selective knowledge transfer with interpretable pathways, solving the data imbalance problem in urban forecasting through targeted retrieval and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BDVAE is a biologically structured deep learning model that integrates multi-omics data to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor response and uncover resistance mechanisms, achieving high accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.94) and providing interpretable biological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models for predicting immune checkpoint inhibitor responses lack interpretability and fail to effectively utilize the biological structure in multi-omics data, limiting understanding of resistance mechanisms.

Method: Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE) with modality- and pathway-specific encoders, using variational inference to learn biologically meaningful latent features from transcriptomic and genomic data across immune, genomic, and metabolic processes.

Result: Achieved AUC-ROC of 0.94 on test data, identified critical resistance mechanisms including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal signaling, and revealed resistance as a continuous biological spectrum rather than binary states.

Conclusion: BDVAE demonstrates the value of biologically structured machine learning for generating interpretable, clinically relevant insights into complex resistance patterns, potentially guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining textual sentiment and vocal tract dynamics from earnings calls predicts stock volatility but not returns, with emotional transitions between scripted and spontaneous speech being key predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Information asymmetry in financial markets is amplified by strategically crafted corporate narratives, undermining conventional textual analysis. There's a need to decode latent uncertainty markers from verifiable biometric signals to enhance market interpretability.

Method: Proposes Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM) using nonlinear acoustics to extract emotional signatures from executive vocal tract dynamics. Projects both acoustic and textual emotional states onto a 3D Affective State Label space (Tension, Stability, Arousal). Analyzes 1,795 earnings calls (~1,800 hours) capturing dynamic affect shifts between scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A.

Result: Multimodal features explain up to 43.8% of out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility but do not forecast directional stock returns. Volatility predictions are driven by emotional dynamics during executive speech transitions: reduced textual stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant arousal variability from CEOs.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach substantially outperforms financials-only baseline, providing investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty through verifiable biometric signals.

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

TL;DR: FFT MoE is a novel federated fine-tuning framework that replaces LoRA with sparse Mixture of Experts adapters to address structural incompatibility and non-IID data challenges in heterogeneous FL environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LoRA-based Federated Fine-Tuning in heterogeneous FL environments, including structural incompatibility across clients with varying configurations and poor adaptability to non-IID data distributions.

Method: Proposes FFT MoE framework using sparse Mixture of Experts adapters where each client trains a lightweight gating network to activate personalized expert subsets. Includes heterogeneity-aware auxiliary loss to combat expert load imbalance and ensure balanced utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments show FFT MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FFT baselines in both IID and non-IID conditions for generalization performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: FFT MoE effectively addresses key challenges in federated fine-tuning by enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while maintaining aggregation compatibility and handling data heterogeneity through expert diversity mechanisms.

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Method: Proposed holistic auditing approach for both unlearned and retained samples using DP and membership inference attacks perspectives, and developed efficient A-LiRA MIA with data augmentation.

Result: Experimental findings show existing unlearning algorithms inadvertently compromise privacy of retained samples in differentially private models.

Conclusion: Differentially private unlearning algorithms are needed to properly protect privacy of both unlearned and retained samples in machine learning models.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

### [87] [Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18672)
*Taishi Nakamura,Satoki Ishikawa,Masaki Kawamura,Takumi Okamoto,Daisuke Nohara,Jun Suzuki,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE models show different scaling behaviors: memorization improves with total parameters while reasoning performance saturates or regresses despite training loss improvements, and sparsity affects generalization gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Mixture-of-Experts sparsity influences different capability regimes (memorization vs reasoning) in large language models, as current scaling laws overlook this sparsity dimension.

Method: Trained families of MoE Transformers varying total parameters, active parameters, and top-k routing while keeping compute budget fixed. Measured pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and accuracy across different benchmarks.

Result: Memorization benchmarks improve with total parameters, while reasoning performance saturates/regresses despite training loss gains. Top-k changes alone have little effect, and neither RLHF nor extra test-time compute fixes reasoning deficits in overly sparse models.

Conclusion: MoE sparsity significantly impacts model capabilities differently - total parameters drive memorization but reasoning requires careful sparsity management, as it doesn't scale monotonically like training loss.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

*Chufan Gao,Jintai Chen,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRTab is a novel prompting-based approach that combines training data learning with retrieval to improve tabular reasoning, outperforming previous methods while being interpretable and cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for tabular reasoning either use finetuning (dataset-specific but lacks generalizability) or training-free prompting (generalizable but doesn't leverage training data). There's a need to integrate the benefits of both methods.

Method: Learn then Retrieve (LRTab) approach: 1) Get chain-of-thought responses from training data, 2) For incorrect responses, prompt LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to avoid errors, 3) Validate Prompt Conditions using validation data, 4) At inference, retrieve relevant Prompt Conditions as additional context.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact datasets show that LRTab outperforms previous baselines in tabular reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LRTab successfully integrates the advantages of both finetuning and training-free approaches, providing an interpretable and cost-efficient solution for tabular reasoning that leverages learned insights from training data through retrieval.

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end deep learning framework for sepsis detection using autoencoder feature extraction and MLP classifier, outperforming traditional ML methods with 74.6-93.5% accuracy across ICU cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML methods struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series data in EHRs and require manual feature engineering for sepsis detection in ICU settings.

Method: Unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction + multilayer perceptron classifier. Uses customized down sampling for training and non-overlapping dynamic sliding window for real-time inference. Processes time series with fixed dimension vectors and missingness indicators.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 74.6%, 80.6%, and 93.5% across three ICU cohorts, consistently outperforming traditional ML baselines (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

TL;DR: A unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification using physics-inspired embeddings with massive compression and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient image classification system that leverages the connections between statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology to achieve high performance with massive parameter compression.

Method: High-dimensional feature vectors are interpreted as spins on a sparse MET-QC-LDPC graph forming a Random-Bond Ising Model operated at Nishimori temperature. Uses topological invariants to guide graph design and efficient beta_N estimation with quadratic interpolant and Newton correction.

Result: Achieves 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100 with 40x parameter compression (1280D to 32/64D features), demonstrating six-fold speed-up over bisection methods.

Conclusion: Topology-guided graph design enables highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings that maintain state-of-the-art performance despite massive compression, showing the power of interdisciplinary approaches in machine learning.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructRTL is a novel structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework that uses control data flow graphs (CDFGs) to improve RTL design quality estimation, outperforming previous methods by incorporating structural semantics and knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for RTL quality estimation overlook structural semantics, which are crucial for accurate estimation of metrics like area and delay. CDFGs provide richer structural characteristics that enable better representation learning.

Method: Proposes StructRTL framework that learns structure-informed representations from CDFGs using graph self-supervised learning. Incorporates knowledge distillation to transfer insights from post-mapping netlists into the CDFG predictor.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior methods on various RTL quality estimation tasks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Combining structural learning with cross-stage supervision through knowledge distillation is highly effective for RTL design quality estimation, demonstrating the importance of structural semantics in electronic design automation workflows.

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

*Enrique Mármol Campos,Aurora González Vidal,José Luis Hernández Ramos,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAegis is a two-stage defense framework that uses symbolic time series transformation and spectral clustering to detect Byzantine clients in federated learning, combined with FFT-based aggregation to mitigate their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning's decentralized nature makes it vulnerable to Byzantine clients that can poison the training process through malicious model updates, compromising system integrity.

Method: Two-stage defensive framework: 1) Uses symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify differences between benign and malicious models, 2) Employs spectral clustering for accurate adversarial behavior detection, and 3) Incorporates FFT-based aggregation as a final mitigation layer.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy across five poisoning attacks (including label flipping and adaptive optimization-based strategies), maintaining high performance under strong adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: FLAegis provides an effective defense mechanism against Byzantine attacks in federated learning, demonstrating robust performance and improved system security through its multi-stage detection and mitigation approach.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides statistical analysis of Bellman residual minimization (BRM) in offline reinforcement learning, achieving O(1/n) excess risk bound without additional regularization or restrictive assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline RL and inverse RL methods struggle with Bellman consistency, and while BRM with stochastic gradient descent-ascent shows promise, its statistical behavior in offline settings remains unexplored.

Method: The analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that couples SGDA runs on neighboring datasets, providing O(1/n) on-average argument-stability bound for convex-concave saddle problems.

Result: Achieves O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM without variance reduction, extra regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling, doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent.

Conclusion: The approach works for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch SGD, closing the statistical gap in offline BRM analysis and providing strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: Novel constraint-based model reduction approach for MILP that identifies critical inequality constraints to transform into equalities, improving solution quality by 50% and reducing computation time by 17.47%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model reduction methods focus on variable reduction, while constraint reduction (transforming inequality constraints to equalities) has been largely ignored despite its potential to reduce MILP complexity.

Method: Proposes multi-modal representation technique using both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations to identify critical tight-constraints at optimal solution, with heuristic rule for constraint selection.

Result: Method improves solution quality by over 50% and reduces computation time by 17.47% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Constraint-based model reduction is an effective approach for accelerating MILP solving, with significant improvements in both solution quality and computational efficiency over existing variable reduction methods.

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models suffer from high memory access costs during inference, and previous memory-layer architectures like UltraMem only matched 2-expert MoE performance, falling short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations.

Method: Redesigned memory-layer architecture with five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections, adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.

Result: UltraMemV2 achieves performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and parameters but with significantly lower memory access. Shows superior performance on memory-intensive tasks: +1.6 points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization, and +7.9 points on in-context learning. Validated at scale with models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters.

Conclusion: Memory-layer architectures now achieve performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling alternative for efficient sparse computation. Activation density has greater impact on performance than total sparse parameter count.

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled

Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and

superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6

TL;DR: GaaS is a modular governance layer that enforces policies on AI agents at runtime without modifying their internals, using declarative rules and trust scoring to block high-risk behaviors while maintaining system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed AI ecosystems lack scalable, decoupled governance, with existing oversight mechanisms being reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them non-auditable and hard to generalize.

Method: Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) employs declarative rules and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and severity-weighted violations, enabling coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions with graduated enforcement.

Result: In simulations with open-source models across content generation and financial decision-making, GaaS reliably blocked or redirected high-risk behaviors while preserving throughput, with trust scores effectively tracking rule adherence and isolating untrustworthy components.

Conclusion: GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems by positioning governance as a runtime service that enforces ethics rather than teaching them, providing scalable oversight for distributed AI systems.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates federated learning with heterogeneous client label sets, comparing public vs private label settings and showing that standard FL methods can be adapted to maintain performance while increasing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous client label sets are common in real-world federated learning but rarely studied, especially when clients want to keep their label sets private rather than sharing them publicly.

Method: Applied classical classifier combination methods with centralized tuning, adapted common FL methods for private label settings, and conducted experiments comparing public vs private label scenarios.

Result: Reducing available labels per client substantially harms performance. Centralized tuning helps but increases variance. Adapted FL methods perform similarly in private settings as standard methods in public settings.

Conclusion: Clients can achieve increased privacy through private label sets with little cost to model accuracy by using properly adapted FL methods.

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWiFT is a debiasing framework that improves fairness while preserving model performance with minimal data and training requirements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on medical imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models exhibit bias in healthcare applications, risking social discrimination and poor generalization. Existing debiasing methods require extensive retraining and compromise performance.

Method: Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning identifies parameter contributions to bias vs performance, then uses two-step fine-tuning with different gradient flows based on parameter importance.

Result: SWiFT consistently reduces bias across gender, skin tone, and age attributes in dermatology and chest X-ray datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy and showing superior OOD generalization.

Conclusion: SWiFT provides an efficient debiasing solution that balances fairness and performance with minimal data and computational costs, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,

*Shae McFadden,Myles Foley,Mario D'Onghia,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis,Nicola Paoletti,Fabio Pierazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRL-based malware detection agent that jointly optimizes classification and rejection for manual labeling, achieving improved resilience to concept drift in Android malware with significant AUT performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional malware classifiers struggle with concept drift and lack mechanisms to optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling. Real-world malware detection needs to handle evolving threats with limited labeling budgets and uncertain predictions.

Method: Formulated malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and trained a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to simultaneously optimize classification performance and reject high-risk samples for manual labeling.

Result: DRMD agent achieved significant AUT performance improvements: 5.18±5.44 (classification only), 14.49±12.86 (classification with rejection), and 10.06±10.81 (classification with rejection and active learning) compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: DRL can effectively facilitate malware detection and improve resilience to concept drift in dynamic Android malware environments, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

### [101] [Recycling History: Efficient Recommendations from Contextual Dueling Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18841)
*Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Jalal Etesami,Pouria Fatemi,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new bandit model where users compare consumed items with historical items, achieving O(√T) regret through informative queries and random exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contextual duelling bandits only capture implicit choices but don't utilize post-consumption comparisons, which provide more reliable user feedback.

Method: Algorithm recommends one item per time step; after consumption, user compares it with a historical item. Uses initial random exploration to build diverse history and matrix concentration bounds for analysis.

Result: Achieves O(√T) regret bound. Simulations show significantly lower regret compared to methods that only compare simultaneously recommended items.

Conclusion: Leveraging historical items for post-consumption comparisons enables more efficient learning and better regret performance in recommendation systems.

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-Flat is a plug-and-play method that promotes flatter loss landscapes in continual learning, improving performance across various settings while C-Flat++ reduces computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sharpness-aware minimization methods in continual learning may favor sharper minima over flatter ones, leading to less robust and potentially suboptimal solutions.

Method: Proposes C-Flat method that promotes flatter loss landscapes for continual learning, with plug-and-play compatibility. Also introduces C-Flat++ framework with selective flatness-driven promotion to reduce update costs.

Result: C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of continual learning settings, methods, datasets, and scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed C-Flat and C-Flat++ approaches demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency in continual learning by promoting flatter loss landscapes and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

*Yunyang Cao,Juekai Lin,Wenhao Li,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOCHA is a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in temporal point processes that models time-varying causal structures as multi-hop paths on a latent evolving graph, achieving state-of-the-art event prediction while providing interpretable causal insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal discovery in temporal point processes rely on static or first-order causal structures, which overlook the multi-order and time-varying nature of real-world causal relationships in event sequences.

Method: MOCHA introduces a time-varying directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, enforcing acyclicity and sparsity constraints. It uses an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal discovery and TPP dynamics through multi-hop causal paths on a latent time-evolving graph.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show MOCHA achieves state-of-the-art performance in event prediction and reveals meaningful, interpretable causal structures that capture complex temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: MOCHA successfully addresses the limitations of previous methods by modeling multi-order dynamic causality, providing both accurate event prediction and interpretable causal insights through its novel time-varying DAG framework with structural constraints.

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAEPO introduces a history-aware exploratory loss that compresses trajectories into cumulative logarithmic likelihoods, applies Plackett-Luce softmax for normalized weighting, and adds entropy regularization and KL penalties to enable stable, thorough exploration in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPO and GRPO often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks despite leveraging full sequence log-likelihoods or per-token ratios, creating a need for better exploration techniques.

Method: HAEPO compresses trajectories into sum of logarithmic probabilities, applies Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories for normalized weights proportional to returns, and adds entropy regularization with soft KL penalty relative to previous policy.

Result: HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior comparable or superior to PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework that explicitly leverages full-trajectory history while effectively balancing exploration and stability in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

TL;DR: DNP improves Neural Processes by combining global and distance-aware local latent structures with bi-Lipschitz regularization for better uncertainty estimation and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Neural Processes struggle with uncertainty calibration and capturing local data dependencies, needing improvement in modeling both global task variations and local input similarities.

Method: Introduces global latent variable for task-level variations and local latent variable in distance-preserving latent space using bi-Lipschitz regularization to preserve input relationships.

Result: DNP achieves strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across regression and classification tasks, effectively distinguishing in-from out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: The proposed Distance-informed Neural Process successfully addresses limitations of standard NPs through combined global-local modeling with distance preservation, resulting in superior uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear dynamics, covering both time-dependent and time-independent cases under Lipschitz continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work only analyzed linear dynamics or bounds dependent on sampling intervals, leaving a gap for understanding generalization in general nonlinear neural ODEs.

Method: Analyzed neural ODEs with Lipschitz continuous nonlinear dynamics functions, showing solutions have bounded variations, then established generalization bounds considering overparameterization and domain constraints.

Result: Derived generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear dynamics, demonstrating how overparameterization and domain constraints affect these bounds.

Conclusion: This work provides the first generalization error bounds for neural ODEs with nonlinear dynamics, advancing theoretical understanding of continuous-depth models' generalization behavior.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Conclusion: HierCVAE effectively addresses multi-scale temporal modeling challenges with significant performance improvements and robust uncertainty handling.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across

TL;DR: Energy-based flow matching for molecular structure generation that iteratively maps random configurations to target structures, outperforming recent baselines in protein docking and backbone generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular structure generation is crucial for biological applications like molecular docking and protein folding. Recent generative models have made progress but there's room for improvement in training and inference efficiency.

Method: Adopts an energy-based perspective for flow matching, using a deep network to iteratively map random configurations from source distribution to target structures in the data manifold.

Result: Outperforms recent baselines of task-associated flow matching and diffusion models in protein docking and protein backbone generation experiments using similar computational budget.

Conclusion: The energy-based flow matching approach provides a conceptually simple and empirically effective setup with theoretical justification and connections to fundamental properties like idempotency and stability.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

TL;DR: Comparison of three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, Staged Logit) for measuring conditional label covariance in multilabel data, finding all perform similarly but tend to falsely detect dependent covariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilabel data analysis requires understanding label dependence, but existing methods like multivariate Probit models may not reliably estimate constant vs dependent covariance due to their copula covariance estimation approach.

Method: Compared three statistical models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, and Staged Logit) through experiments to observe their performance in measuring conditional label covariance under different covariance strength conditions.

Result: All three models measured constant and dependent covariance equally well depending on covariance strength, but all falsely detected dependent covariance when constant covariance was actually present. Multivariate Probit had the lowest error rate among the three.

Conclusion: While Multivariate Probit performed best, all tested models suffer from the limitation of falsely identifying dependent covariance in constant covariance scenarios, indicating need for improved methods in multilabel dependence analysis.

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Result: Koopman embeddings outperform both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and data-efficient performance. Fixing pre-trained transformer weights during fine-tuning shows no performance degradation.

Conclusion: Koopman embeddings capture reusable dynamical structure rather than task-specific patterns, making them suitable as a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning.

during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the

TL;DR: PAX-TS is a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm for explaining time series forecasting models through localized input perturbations, providing multi-granular explanations and capturing cross-channel correlations in multivariate forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern forecasting models like transformers and LLMs are opaque and lack explanation capabilities, while existing explainability methods like LIME are unsuitable for time series forecasting contexts.

Method: Based on localized input perturbations, PAX-TS generates multi-granular explanations and characterizes cross-channel correlations. The algorithm was tested on 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets.

Result: Explanations differ between high and low-performing algorithms, effectively capturing model behavior. Six pattern classes were identified across datasets, showing performance differences. The method successfully demonstrates cross-channel correlation handling.

Conclusion: PAX-TS effectively illustrates forecasting model mechanisms at different detail levels and provides practical explanations for forecasts, making it a valuable tool for understanding time series forecasting model behavior.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based HFL methods suffer from sub-optimal global knowledge due to weighted averaging aggregation, causing prototype shrinking that degrades performance in heterogeneous models and extremely non-IID data scenarios.

Method: Proposes FedProtoKD with enhanced dual-knowledge distillation using clients' logits and prototype features, contrastive learning-based trainable server prototype with class-wise adaptive margins, and importance assessment of public samples based on prototype closeness.

Result: Achieved average improvements of 1.13% to 34.13% accuracy across various settings, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD effectively resolves prototype margin-shrinking problem and enhances learning performance in heterogeneous federated learning environments with non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

TL;DR: STDiff is a diffusion-based method that reframes time series imputation as learning system dynamics evolution, using causal conditioning on recent states and control inputs to handle long gaps in industrial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional window-based imputation methods fail in industrial systems with non-stationary dynamics, control actions, and long uninterrupted gaps, requiring a dynamics-aware approach.

Method: Uses conditional denoising diffusion model with causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on recent known state and relevant control/environmental inputs.

Result: Achieves lowest errors on wastewater treatment dataset with simulated gaps (advantage increases for longer gaps), produces dynamically plausible trajectories on raw industrial data with real gaps.

Conclusion: Dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation is robust for industrial time series; diffusion models effectively capture system evolution for handling long gaps.

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

*Luis Mantilla Calderón,Alán Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physical system using springs and sticks can approximate any continuous function through piecewise-linear approximation and energy minimization, achieving performance comparable to neural networks while revealing thermodynamic learning barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand learning as a physical process by creating a simple mechanical system that can perform function approximation and study its thermodynamic properties.

Method: Use sticks to create piecewise-linear approximations of functions, encode mean squared error loss through spring potential energy, and converge to minimum-energy configurations via dissipation. Apply to regression tasks and analyze thermodynamic properties.

Result: The system performs comparably to multi-layer perceptrons on regression tasks. Thermodynamic analysis reveals a learning barrier where the system cannot learn if its free energy change hits a certain threshold due to environmental fluctuations.

Conclusion: This simple physical model provides insights into learning systems from a physical perspective, demonstrating that mechanical systems can approximate functions and revealing fundamental thermodynamic constraints on learning processes.

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

TL;DR: Resource-centric next-activity prediction using LightGBM and Transformer models with 2-gram encoding outperforms traditional control-flow approaches, enabling better resource allocation and workforce planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive process monitoring focuses on control-flow perspective, but resource-centric viewpoint offers additional benefits like improved work organization, workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Resource information's role in next-activity prediction remains unexplored despite its proven value in process performance analysis.

Method: Evaluated four prediction models (including LightGBM, Transformer, and Random Forest) and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets. Tested encodings based on 2-gram activity transitions and combinations with activity repetition features.

Result: LightGBM and Transformer models performed best with 2-gram activity transitions encoding. Random Forest benefited most from combined encoding of 2-gram transitions and activity repetition features, which achieved the highest average accuracy.

Conclusion: Resource-centric approach enables smarter resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee support by analyzing individual behavior. Findings open new research venues for predictive process monitoring beyond traditional control-flow perspectives.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) which exhibit stealthy behavior and face extreme class imbalance in detection datasets.

Method: Propose an active learning-based anomaly detection framework leveraging similarity search with Attention-Based Autoencoder, using feature-space similarity to identify normal-like and anomaly-like instances with minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces demonstrate that similarity metric choice significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines for threat intelligence and cyber defense applications.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

### [119] [GRADSTOP: Early Stopping of Gradient Descent via Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19028)
*Arash Jamshidi,Lauri Seppäläinen,Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich,Hoang Phuc Hau Luu,Anton Björklund,Kai Puolamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradStop is a novel early stopping method that uses gradient information instead of validation sets to prevent overfitting, allowing full dataset usage for training with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional early stopping requires hold-out validation sets which reduce training data. This is problematic in data-limited settings like transfer learning where every sample is valuable.

Method: Estimates Bayesian posterior using gradient information from training, defines early stopping as sampling from this posterior, and uses approximated posterior to derive stopping criterion.

Result: Achieves small test loss and performs favorably compared to validation-set-based stopping, particularly advantageous in data-limited scenarios.

Conclusion: GradStop provides an effective alternative to validation-based early stopping by leveraging free gradient information, enabling full dataset usage for training with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

### [120] [When recalling in-context, Transformers are not SSMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19029)
*Destiny Okpekpe,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern recurrent models like SSMs show subquadratic complexity but underperform transformers on reasoning tasks. This paper analyzes associative recall performance, revealing critical learning rate sensitivity in recurrent models, contrasting scaling benefits between architectures, and unexpected induction head formation in 1-layer transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why modern recurrent models (e.g., state-space models) underperform transformers on reasoning and memorization tasks like associative recall, despite their computational efficiency advantages.

Method: The study conducts detailed analysis of associative recall performance, examines learning rate effects on recurrent models, compares scaling in width vs depth between architectures, inspects 1-layer transformer training dynamics, and performs architectural ablations on Transformer and Mamba models.

Result: Recurrent models show critical sensitivity to learning rate choice (unlike transformers), attention models struggle with single-layer AR tasks, 1-layer transformers surprisingly form induction heads despite poor performance, and architectural components significantly affect optimization stability.

Conclusion: Training stability issues in recurrent models require further research, architectural differences lead to contrasting scaling behaviors, and even minimal transformer architectures exhibit complex learning phenomena, highlighting the need for better understanding of optimization and architectural interactions.

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

*Vemula Sreenath,Filippo Gatti,Pierre Jehel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transparent machine learning architecture using HazBinLoss function addresses black-box limitations and data imbalance in ground motion models, providing interpretable predictions while maintaining performance comparable to established models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML approaches for ground motion models are black boxes that are hard to interpret and trust, limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, earthquake databases suffer from significant data imbalances with fewer critical near-field records compared to abundant less damaging distant records.

Method: Developed a transparent ML architecture where each input (magnitude, distance, interaction terms, etc.) is processed separately and added linearly to obtain output, showing exact contribution of each term. Used HazBinLoss function that assigns higher weights to critical near-field large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller magnitude records during training.

Result: The model captures known seismological principles and achieves comparable performance with established ground motion models while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches for risk assessment studies and disaster planning by providing transparent and trustworthy predictions for critical earthquake scenarios.

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

*Paul Garnier,Jonathan Viquerat,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs can extrapolate and generate numerical schemes beyond training data, rediscovering finite volume schemes through symbolic regression and unsupervised PINN-like training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GNNs' extrapolation capabilities beyond traditional approximation roles and demonstrate their potential for generating numerical schemes in scientific computing.

Method: Train GNNs on minimal datasets (2-node graphs), use symbolic regression to analyze learned schemes, and employ unsupervised PINN-like residual loss training without ground-truth data.

Result: GNNs successfully rediscovered first-order finite volume schemes with O(ε) error, and higher-order GNNs autonomously discovered second-order correction terms and midpoint schemes.

Conclusion: GNNs can actively contribute to developing novel numerical methods, serving purposes beyond approximation and opening new paradigms in scientific computing.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

*Antonio Balordi,Lorenzo Manini,Fabio Stella,Alessio Merlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient Federated Unlearning framework using Hessian information to selectively reset parameters sensitive to forgotten data, enabling privacy-compliant data erasure without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations require data erasure from deep learning models, which is particularly challenging in Federated Learning where data remains on clients and full retraining is often infeasible.

Method: Uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. Model-agnostic approach without requiring server access to raw client data.

Result: Strong privacy protection (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased), high performance (Normalized Accuracy ≈ 0.9 against retrained benchmarks), and effective backdoor attack neutralization.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for data forgetting in Federated Learning that balances privacy, performance, and efficiency while maintaining model integrity against malicious attacks.

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks suffer from performance limitations due to graph topology issues like oversquashing and oversmoothing, which graph rewiring techniques aim to mitigate.

Method: TRIGON jointly optimizes triangle selection from multiple graph views and downstream classification performance to create rewired graphs with improved structural properties.

Result: TRIGON produces graphs with reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on node classification tasks across homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses GNN limitations through learned triangulation-based rewiring, demonstrating superior performance on various graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

TL;DR: APT-LLM is a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs that achieves significant speedups through novel data formats, matrix multiplication methods, memory management, and kernel optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have enormous computational demands that limit deployment and real-time performance. Existing quantization methods face challenges with GPU Tensor Core support, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations for ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision.

Method: Proposes APT-LLM with: 1) bipolar-INT data format for efficient conversion and parallel computation, 2) bit-level matrix multiplication method for arbitrary precision and Tensor Core optimization, 3) memory management system using shared memory for faster execution, and 4) dynamic kernel mapping for optimal hyperparameter selection.

Result: Achieves up to 3.99× speedup vs FP16 baselines and 2.16× speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, achieves up to 2.44× speedup over FP16 and 1.65× speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: APT-LLM effectively addresses GPU acceleration challenges for arbitrary precision LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements across different hardware platforms and establishing a comprehensive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

*Shervin Khalafi,Ignacio Hounie,Dongsheng Ding,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models to ensure generated samples satisfy multiple reward constraints while maintaining fidelity to pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving diffusion model outputs (alignment and composition) cannot guarantee that generated samples faithfully possess all desired properties, especially when dealing with competing rewards or multiple models.

Method: Proposes a constrained optimization framework with theoretical characterization and develops a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate solutions that satisfy reward constraints while remaining close to pre-trained models.

Result: Empirical demonstrations in image generation show the approach effectively satisfies constraints and outperforms equally-weighted approaches for both alignment and composition tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the gap in ensuring diffusion models generate samples with all desired properties through constrained optimization, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

TL;DR: Novel framework combining probabilistic crowd modeling and active learning for preference-based RL, handling noisy multi-annotator feedback and prioritizing informative queries for faster learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high cost and low availability of reliable human feedback in preference-based RL, especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly.

Method: Extend Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers with online reliability estimation, incorporate entropy-based query selection for active learning, and use probabilistic crowd modeling for noisy feedback.

Result: Agents trained with feedback on uncertain trajectories show faster learning in most tasks, outperform baselines in blood glucose control task using UVA/Padova simulator.

Conclusion: Combining crowd modeling with active learning effectively improves preference-based RL by reducing human feedback costs while maintaining or improving performance across diverse environments.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

TL;DR: Dense associative memory models with Potts hidden units analyzed through statistical mechanics, leading to stable training regularization and network-growing algorithms for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAM models show robustness to adversarial examples and connections to attention mechanisms in transformers and diffusion models, but require better understanding of their training dynamics and stability.

Method: Statistical mechanics analysis of three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, deriving saddle-point equations for both real and synthetic data, plus novel regularization scheme and network-growing algorithm.

Result: Derived analytical characterization of stationary points, proposed regularization that stabilizes training, demonstrated interpretable solutions for classification tasks, and identified saddle-point hierarchy enabling efficient network growth.

Conclusion: The statistical mechanics approach provides fundamental insights into DAM training dynamics, enabling stable regularization and computationally efficient network-growing methods that leverage saddle-point hierarchies.

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations that model emotion ambiguity through rate of change, outperforming conventional methods on both bounded and unbounded continuous emotion traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continuous emotion recognition approaches ignore emotion ambiguity or treat it as static, failing to capture the dynamic and ambiguous nature of emotions over time.

Method: Proposed ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations that model emotion ambiguity through its rate of change, evaluated on RECOLA and GameVibe corpora for bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.

Result: Ordinal representations outperformed conventional ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels with highest CCC and SDA scores, and excelled in SDA for bounded traces, showing superior ability to capture relative changes in emotion traces.

Conclusion: The proposed ordinal framework effectively captures both emotion annotation ambiguity and temporal dynamics, demonstrating significant improvements in modeling emotional traces compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

*Heng Lin,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First formal proof that Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) fundamentally expands LLM capabilities by breaking pure-text limitations through tools like Python interpreters, with ASPO algorithm improving tool usage behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs with tools show promise, there's been no principled theory explaining why this paradigm is effective. The work aims to provide the first formal explanation for TIR's success.

Method: Introduces Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO) to guide model behavior without compromising training stability. Uses Python interpreter as external tool and conducts experiments on mathematical benchmarks.

Result: TIR model decisively outperforms pure-text counterpart on pass@k metric, with advantages extending beyond computational problems to abstract insight tasks. Shows improved tool usage with early code invocation and more interactive turns.

Conclusion: Provides first principled explanation for TIR's success, demonstrating tools enable strict expansion of model capabilities by unlocking otherwise impossible problem-solving strategies, shifting focus from whether tools work to why and how they enable more powerful reasoning.

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

*Zayd M. K. Zuhri,Erland Hilman Fuadi,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token Order Prediction (TOP) outperforms both standard next-token prediction and multi-token prediction on NLP benchmarks by using a learning-to-rank approach to order upcoming tokens instead of exact prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) shows inconsistent improvements and underperforms in standard NLP benchmarks. The exact future token prediction in MTP is too difficult as an auxiliary loss, suggesting a need for a more effective approach.

Method: Propose Token Order Prediction (TOP) which trains models to order upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. Requires only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple transformer layers. Pretrained models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives.

Result: Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale, demonstrating consistent improvements across different model sizes.

Conclusion: Token Order Prediction provides a more effective auxiliary training objective than Multi-Token Prediction, achieving better performance on standard NLP tasks while being more parameter-efficient with only a single additional layer.

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple

NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

### [133] [Consensus Is All You Need: Gossip-Based Reasoning Among Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18292)
*Saksham Arora*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Gossip-based consensus approach where multiple LLMs exchange answers and reasoning to reach collective decisions, overcoming individual model weaknesses and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single LLM excels in all areas - each has strengths and weaknesses. Inspired by gossip protocols in distributed systems where peers exchange information to reach agreement.

Method: Models act as nodes in peer-to-peer network, exchanging answers and thought processes to gradually work toward shared solutions through gossip-based consensus.

Result: Leads to robust, resilient, and accurate multi-agent AI reasoning. Helps overcome individual model weaknesses and brings out collective strengths.

Conclusion: Makes AI more collaborative and trustworthy by mimicking human consensus-building, moving beyond black-box program behavior.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

### [134] [Murakkab: Resource-Efficient Agentic Workflow Orchestration in Cloud Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18298)
*Gohar Irfan Chaudhry,Esha Choukse,Haoran Qiu,Íñigo Goiri,Rodrigo Fonseca,Adam Belay,Ricardo Bianchini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Murakkab is a resource-efficient serving system for agentic workflows that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration, enabling cross-layer optimization to reduce GPU usage, energy consumption, and cost while maintaining service-level objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks for serving agentic workflows are inefficient because they expose workflows as opaque sequences of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware choices, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy, latency, energy, and cost.

Method: Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples workflow specification from execution configuration. It uses a profile-guided optimizer and adaptive runtime to jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs.

Result: Evaluation shows Murakkab reduces GPU usage by up to 2.8×, energy consumption by 3.7×, and cost by 4.3× while maintaining SLOs.

Conclusion: By exposing the internal structure of agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve, making it a resource-efficient serving system for agentic workflows.

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

### [135] [Toward Generalized Autonomous Agents: A Neuro-Symbolic AI Framework for Integrating Social and Technical Support in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18406)
*Ryan Hare,Ying Tang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A multi-agent neuro-symbolic framework combining RL-based tutor and LLM-powered peer agents to support student-centered learning through structured guidance and social interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empower students to take ownership of their learning by providing structured, supportive environments that enable goal-setting, progress tracking, and adaptive strategies through AI-powered digital learning tools.

Method: A multi-agent neuro-symbolic framework with specialized pedagogical roles: an RL-based tutor agent for non-verbal scaffolding and a proactive LLM-powered peer agent for social learning dimensions, unified through a central educational ontology.

Result: The framework demonstrates adaptability across domains through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, showing effective cross-domain learning support.

Conclusion: The unified multi-agent approach offers transformative opportunities for AI-driven learning environments, with future directions focusing on advancing scalable, adaptive educational support systems.

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

*Promise Osaine Ekpo,Brian La,Thomas Wiener,Saesha Agarwal,Arshia Agrawal,Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega,Lekan P. Molu,Angelique Taylor*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: FairSkillMARL framework combines workload balance and skill-task alignment for fairness in healthcare MARL, with a new hospital simulator showing that equal workload alone causes skill mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL fairness approaches focus only on workload balance, ignoring agent expertise and the need for proper skill-task alignment in real-world domains like healthcare to prevent burnout and optimize resource utilization.

Method: Proposed FairSkillMARL framework with dual fairness objectives (workload balance + skill-task alignment) and created MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare environment for testing. Compared against 4 standard MARL methods and 2 state-of-the-art fairness metrics.

Result: Experiments showed that fairness based solely on equal workload leads to task-skill mismatches, demonstrating the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task alignment.

Conclusion: The work provides essential tools and foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical, particularly in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

*Lu Liu,Chi Xie,Xi Xiong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A multiagent truncated rollout approach for CAV speed coordination in mixed autonomy traffic that improves highway throughput while reducing computational overhead through adaptive horizon shortening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of efficient coordination among connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed autonomy environments with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) due to heterogeneous driving behaviors.

Method: Formulates traffic density evolution equation accounting for CAV presence, establishes distributed coordination framework using neighbor kinematic information and agent-by-agent sequential solution, and introduces truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens optimization horizon.

Result: Outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both average travel time in bottleneck areas and overall computational time in large-scale mixed traffic flow simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides rigorous stability guarantees, improves real-time performance and scalability, and shows strong potential for practical deployment in mixed autonomy traffic environments.

Abstract: The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers
substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed
autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs),
achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to
heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a
multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to
improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this
approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that
comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed
coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating
kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent
sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among
CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively
shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences.
This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time
performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees
on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations
conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale
mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model
predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the
bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong
potential for practical deployment.
