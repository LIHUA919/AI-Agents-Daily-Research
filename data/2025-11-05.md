### [1] [Mirror-Neuron Patterns in AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01885)
*Robyn Wyrick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Research investigates if artificial neural networks can develop mirror-neuron-like patterns to enable intrinsic AI alignment through empathy-like mechanisms, using a cooperative game framework where such patterns emerged and supported ethical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment strategies relying on external constraints may be insufficient for super-intelligent AI; this study explores intrinsic alignment through biologically-inspired mirror neuron patterns that could foster empathy and cooperation.

Method: Used a novel Frog and Toad game framework to promote cooperative behaviors, identified conditions for mirror-neuron pattern emergence, evaluated their influence on action circuits, and introduced the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation.

Result: Appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling fostered shared neural representations analogous to biological mirror neurons, which supported cooperative behavior in AI systems.

Conclusion: Mirror-neuron-like patterns in ANNs can contribute to intrinsic AI alignment by embedding empathy-like mechanisms, complementing existing techniques for safer super-intelligent AI.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

### [2] [When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794)
*Chenyu Zhang,Minsol Kim,Shohreh Ghorbani,Jingyao Wu,Rosalind Picard,Patricia Maes,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a diagnostic layer to expose modality conflicts in MLLMs by treating modalities as agents with self-assessments, identifying contributors vs saboteurs to multimodal predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs lack transparency in reasoning traces - unclear which modality drives predictions, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates.

Method: Lightweight model-agnostic evaluation layer treating each modality as an agent producing candidate labels and self-assessments, with simple fusion mechanism to aggregate outputs.

Result: Applied to multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks, revealed systematic reliability profiles showing whether failures come from dataset artifacts or model limitations.

Conclusion: Framework provides diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, enabling principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing potential interventions.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

### [3] [Human-AI Co-Embodied Intelligence for Scientific Experimentation and Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02071)
*Xinyi Lin,Yuyang Zhang,Yuanhang Gan,Juntao Chen,Hao Shen,Yichun He,Lijun Li,Ze Yuan,Shuang Wang,Chaohao Wang,Rui Zhang,Na Li,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces human-AI co-embodied intelligence system (APEX) that combines human execution with AI reasoning through wearable interfaces for real-world experiments and manufacturing, achieving autonomous, traceable processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between machine intelligence and physical execution in scientific experiments and manufacturing, which currently relies heavily on human supervision, limiting reproducibility and scalability.

Method: Human-AI co-embodied intelligence paradigm integrating human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware. APEX system uses mixed-reality to observe human actions, align with procedures, provide 3D guidance, and analyze steps in real-time.

Result: APEX system implemented in cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication achieved context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal LLMs, real-time error correction, and successful expertise transfer to beginners.

Conclusion: Establishes a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning from computation to physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

### [4] [Automated Reward Design for Gran Turismo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02094)
*Michel Ma,Takuma Seno,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter R. Wurman,Peter Stone,Craig Sherstan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated system using foundation models to design reward functions for RL agents in autonomous racing, achieving performance competitive with expert systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping desired behaviors to reward functions in complex environments like autonomous racing is challenging, requiring an automated approach.

Method: Combines LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human feedback to search reward function space based on text instructions.

Result: Produces racing agents competitive with GT Sophy (champion-level RL agent) and generates novel behaviors.

Conclusion: Paves the way for practical automated reward design in real-world applications by leveraging foundation models.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

### [5] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) evaluates whether LLMs learn fundamental human values or just surface-level preferences, finding that models generalize deep values less than chance with an average DVGR of 0.30.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between AI systems that learn fundamental human values (robust alignment) versus those that only capture superficial patterns in preference data (risking misalignment).

Method: Uses controlled confounding between deep values and shallow features in training, then breaks correlations in testing to measure Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR).

Result: Average DVGR across 9 models is 0.30, all models generalize deep values less than chance, and larger models have slightly lower DVGR than smaller models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs fail to robustly generalize fundamental human values, highlighting a critical alignment challenge that requires new approaches beyond surface-level preference learning.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

### [6] [InsurAgent: A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Simulating Individual Behavior in Purchasing Flood Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02119)
*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show qualitative understanding but poor quantitative probability estimation for flood insurance decisions. InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent with RAG and reasoning modules, accurately estimates probabilities and simulates temporal decision evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low flood insurance participation rates despite effectiveness, need to understand behavioral mechanisms behind insurance decisions, and potential of LLMs for simulating human decision-making.

Method: Constructed benchmark dataset, evaluated LLM capabilities, then proposed InsurAgent - a 5-module agent (perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, memory) using RAG for empirical data grounding and LLM reasoning for contextual extrapolation.

Result: LLMs alone show qualitative understanding but poor quantitative probability estimation. InsurAgent achieves accurate marginal and bivariate probability estimation and can simulate temporal decision evolution through memory module.

Conclusion: InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis by combining LLM reasoning with empirical data grounding and temporal simulation capabilities.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

### [7] [Re-FORC: Adaptive Reward Prediction for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02130)
*Renos Zabounidis,Aditya Golatkar,Michael Kleinman,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Re-FORC is an adaptive reward prediction method for reasoning models that enables early stopping, optimized model selection, and adaptive scaling to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models incur high computational costs without systematic ways to predict reward outcomes or optimize resource allocation during reasoning chains.

Method: Trains lightweight adapters on reasoning models to predict expected future rewards as a function of thinking tokens, enabling dynamic length control via cost-per-token thresholds.

Result: Achieved 26% compute reduction with maintained accuracy, 4% higher accuracy at equal compute, 55% less compute at equal accuracy, and 7-11% accuracy improvements in different compute regimes.

Conclusion: Re-FORC provides an effective framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically balances computation cost and performance across different resource constraints.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

### [8] [Personalized Decision Modeling: Utility Optimization or Textualized-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02194)
*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATHENA framework combines symbolic utility discovery and semantic adaptation using LLMs to model individual decision-making, outperforming existing models by 6.5% F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual decision-making often differs from population optimal predictions, requiring integration of numerical attributes and linguistic influences.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Group-level symbolic utility discovery using LLMs 2) Individual-level semantic adaptation creating personalized templates.

Result: Outperforms utility-based, ML, and other LLM models by at least 6.5% F1 score on travel mode and vaccine choice tasks.

Conclusion: ATHENA provides an effective new scheme for human-centric decision modeling through organic integration of symbolic utility and semantic adaptation.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

*Jingbo Wang,Sendong Zhao,Haochun Wang,Yuzheng Fan,Lizhe Zhang,Yan Liu,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STRMAC is a state-aware routing framework for multi-agent systems that adaptively selects the most suitable agent at each step, achieving SOTA performance with 23.8% improvement over baselines and 90.1% reduction in data collection overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems with LLMs suffer from rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements, limiting their full potential.

Method: STRMAC separately encodes interaction history and agent knowledge to power a router that adaptively selects the most suitable single agent at each step, plus a self-evolving data generation approach for efficient training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on collaborative reasoning benchmarks with up to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reduces data collection overhead by up to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Conclusion: STRMAC enables efficient and effective collaboration in multi-agent systems through adaptive agent selection and efficient training data generation.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PPP is a multi-objective RL approach that jointly optimizes productivity, proactivity, and personalization for AI agents, achieving +21.6% improvement over GPT-5 baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses mainly on task success, but effective real-world agents need to optimize three dimensions: productivity (task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and personalization (adapting to user preferences).

Method: Introduced UserVille environment with LLM-based user simulators for diverse preferences, and PPP multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all three dimensions.

Result: Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show PPP agents achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines like GPT-5 (+21.6 on average), demonstrating strategic questioning, adaptation to unseen preferences, and improved task success.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI agents.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

*Changjiang Jiang,Fengchang Yu,Haihua Chen,Wei Lu,Jin Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called \method that improves LLM performance on complex tabular reasoning through query decomposition, table sanitization, and program-of-thoughts reasoning, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on complex tabular reasoning due to complex queries, noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) query decomposer for breaking down questions, (2) table sanitizer for cleaning noisy tables, (3) PoT-based reasoner that generates executable code for final answers.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and 19.87% accuracy improvements on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLM performance for complex tabular numerical reasoning and integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs.

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for
complex tabular numerical reasoning. Data and code are available upon request.

### [12] [Deep Ideation: Designing LLM Agents to Generate Novel Research Ideas on Scientific Concept Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02238)
*Keyu Zhao,Weiquan Lin,Qirui Zheng,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep Ideation framework combines scientific networks with LLM-driven research idea generation, using an iterative workflow with critic feedback, achieving 10.67% quality improvement and producing conference-quality research ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research ideation approaches primarily rely on simplistic methods like keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity, which overlook complex contextual relationships between scientific concepts. Existing LLM-driven methods also fail to effectively utilize scientific concept networks, limiting their grounding in established research.

Method: The proposed Deep Ideation framework integrates a scientific network capturing keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships with LLM-driven ideation. It employs an explore-expand-evolve workflow using an Idea Stack to track progress, and features a critic engine trained on real-world reviewer feedback to guide the process.

Result: Experiments show a 10.67% improvement in idea quality compared to other methods, with generated ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each workflow component.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Deep Ideation framework overcomes previous limitations by integrating scientific concept networks with LLM-driven ideation, resulting in significantly improved research idea quality that exceeds top conference standards and demonstrates practical scientific value.

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

### [13] [When Modalities Conflict: How Unimodal Reasoning Uncertainty Governs Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02243)
*Zhuoran Zhang,Tengyue Wang,Xilin Gong,Yang Shi,Haotian Wang,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework decomposes modality conflict resolution into relative uncertainty and inherent preference, validated through controlled experiments showing probability decreases with increasing modality uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only used coarse statistics, overlooking model confidence in unimodal reasoning when different modalities provide contradictory information.

Method: Constructed a controllable dataset varying visual/textual difficulty, used entropy as uncertainty metric, and analyzed layer-wise predictions near balance points.

Result: Found universal law: modality following probability decreases monotonically with relative uncertainty increase; balance point reveals inherent preference; layer analysis shows oscillation mechanism.

Conclusion: Establishes relative uncertainty and inherent preference as governing principles for modality conflict resolution, providing quantitative framework and mechanistic insights.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

### [14] [Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent LLM for Reasoning: From Lazy Agents to Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02303)
*Zhiwei Zhang,Xiaomin Li,Yudi Lin,Hui Liu,Ramraj Chandradevan,Linlin Wu,Minhua Lin,Fali Wang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses lazy agent behavior in multi-agent LLM systems where one agent dominates collaboration, proposes causal influence measurement and verifiable rewards to enable effective multi-agent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems suffer from lazy agent behavior where one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration and reducing effectiveness to single-agent performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of lazy behavior causes, stable causal influence measurement method, and verifiable reward mechanism allowing reasoning agents to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart reasoning when needed.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework successfully alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate lazy agent behavior in multi-agent LLM systems, enabling true collaborative reasoning and improved performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework for estimating entire Precision-Recall curves for generative models using binary classification, with statistical analysis and minimax bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for generative models rely on scalar metrics, but Precision-Recall curves offer richer analysis. However, estimating entire PR curves poses challenges that need addressing.

Method: Proposed a binary classification-based framework for estimating entire PR curves, conducted thorough statistical analysis including minimax upper bounds on estimation risk.

Result: The framework extends existing PR metrics that are limited to extreme curve values and demonstrates different curve behaviors experimentally in various settings.

Conclusion: The binary classification approach provides a comprehensive method for PR curve estimation in generative models, offering statistical guarantees and practical extensions to existing metrics.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReAcTree is a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes complex goals into manageable subgoals using a dynamically constructed agent tree with LLM agents and control flow nodes, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on monolithic trajectories that entangle all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve entire tasks in a single unified process.

Method: Proposes ReAcTree - a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes complex goals into subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate execution strategies. Integrates two memory systems: episodic memory for goal-specific examples and working memory for shared environment observations.

Result: Experiments on WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets show ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong baselines like ReAct across diverse LLMs. On WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Conclusion: ReAcTree effectively addresses limitations of monolithic trajectory approaches by decomposing complex tasks hierarchically, demonstrating substantial improvements in goal success rates for embodied autonomous agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoCo transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning, using solo demonstrations to significantly improve multi-agent training efficiency without relying on costly multi-agent data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning is highly inefficient, and while existing methods help, they still rely on costly multi-agent data. Solo experiences are much easier to obtain in many practical scenarios.

Method: SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism combining an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor.

Result: Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms.

Conclusion: Solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable across diverse domains.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CudaForge is a training-free multi-agent workflow for generating and optimizing efficient CUDA kernels using LLMs, achieving 97.6% correctness and 1.68x speedup over baselines with low cost and strong GPU/model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CUDA kernel design for AI applications like LLM training is costly and time-consuming, while existing automatic methods produce inefficient kernels with high overhead and poor generalization.

Method: Uses two LLM agents (Coder and Judge) in an iterative workflow inspired by human experts: generate initial kernels, test correctness, analyze hardware feedback (Nsight Compute metrics), and optimize iteratively.

Result: Achieves 97.6% kernel correctness, 1.68x average speedup over PyTorch, outperforms state-of-the-art models. Generalizes across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, etc.) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, etc.), with low cost (~26.5 minutes and $0.3 per kernel).

Conclusion: Multi-agent, training-free workflows enable cost-effective, generalizable, high-performance CUDA kernel optimization, making automated kernel generation practical for AI applications.

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language

TL;DR: Proposes using eigenvalues entropy as an evaluation measure for machine learning classification, particularly effective for imbalanced datasets, with relationships to standard metrics like sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and Gini index.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation measures are less accurate for datasets with imbalanced classes, creating a need for a more reliable metric.

Method: Utilizes eigenvalues entropy as an evaluation measure for binary and multi-class problems, deriving relations to common measures and providing an estimate for the confusion matrix.

Result: The proposed eigenvalues entropy measure demonstrates better performance compared to standard evaluation measures across various data examples.

Conclusion: Eigenvalues entropy is a superior evaluation measure for classification tasks, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes, offering improved accuracy over traditional metrics.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Motivation: Existing learning-based solution operators struggle to generalize to unseen source or boundary functions, and traditional numerical solvers require computationally expensive meshing.

Method: Extracts per-point features from volumetric point clouds and predicts a decomposition of the solution operator, which is applied via numerical integration to evaluate solutions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators in thermal analysis, achieving 13.9% average error reduction across five shape categories and being up to 350x faster than numerical solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Green's Function framework enables robust and efficient generalization for linear PDEs by being agnostic to specific functions used during training, offering significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear

eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based

TL;DR: DeepContour combines deep learning with kernel density estimation to automatically determine optimal integration contours for contour integral methods, accelerating generalized eigenvalue problem solving by up to 5.63×.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge in contour integral methods for solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs), where improper selection of integration contours without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can cause significant computational overhead and numerical inaccuracy.

Method: The proposed method, DeepContour, integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor using Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The FNO rapidly predicts the spectral distribution of a GEP, then KDE systematically determines optimal integration contours, which guide the contour integral (CI) solver to efficiently find desired eigenvalues.

Result: DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets, achieving up to a 5.63× speedup, demonstrating effectiveness on diverse challenging scientific problems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DeepContour represents an efficient and robust paradigm for solving difficult generalized eigenvalue problems with high-dimensional matrices, combining deep learning's predictive power with classical numerical solvers.

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Motivation: Real-world trajectory data faces privacy concerns, high acquisition costs, and quality issues. Existing methods focus on individual movement patterns but ignore the significant influence of dynamic population distribution on mobility behavior.

Method: Proposed a diffusion model framework with spatial graph construction for spatial correlation and a dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and population impact during denoising.

Result: Extensive experiments show generated trajectories closely resemble real-world trajectories in critical statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates dynamic population distribution constraints into trajectory generation, producing high-fidelity results that address privacy and data quality challenges while capturing realistic human mobility patterns.

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

TL;DR: FineXL provides fine-grained natural language explanations for personalized image generation models, identifying multiple aspects of personalization with quantitative scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most personalized image generation models lack explainability about how they are personalized. Existing natural language explanations are coarse-grained and cannot precisely identify multiple aspects of personalization or varying levels in each aspect.

Method: FineXL is a new technique that provides fine-grained explainability in natural language for personalized image generation models. It generates descriptions for each distinct aspect of personalization along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect.

Result: FineXL improves the accuracy of explainability by 56% when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.

Conclusion: FineXL successfully addresses the limitation of coarse-grained explainability by providing fine-grained natural language explanations with quantitative scores for personalized image generation models, significantly improving explainability accuracy.

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Motivation: Current supervised fine-tuning approaches for tool-augmented LLMs struggle to generalize to unfamiliar or complex tool-use scenarios, while RL shows promise for better reasoning and generalization abilities.

Method: Proposed dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL that progressively shifts from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns, and introduced Tool-Zero series models trained by scaling up RL from base models without post-training.

Result: Models achieved over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models, with consistent gains across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Pure RL training can effectively elicit LLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance tool-agnostic generalization, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our

*Hasan Tutar,Caner Erden,Ümit Şentürk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model was developed to objectively determine sample size in qualitative research, replacing the subjective data saturation principle with a systematic approach using 10 key parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional qualitative research sample size determination relies on subjective data saturation, leading to inconsistencies and threatening methodological rigor.

Method: Developed an ensemble ML model using 10 parameters (research scope, information power, researcher competence, etc.) from 5 qualitative approaches. Trained KNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree algorithms on preprocessed data.

Result: ML algorithms achieved high explanatory power (Test R2 ~0.85), effectively modeling complex relationships. Feature importance confirmed key roles of research design type and information power. Proposed web-based computational application framework.

Conclusion: The model represents significant progress in standardizing sample size justification, enhancing transparency, and strengthening qualitative research through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

### [31] [Shorter but not Worse: Frugal Reasoning via Easy Samples as Length Regularizers in Math RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01937)
*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Hadi Abdine,Evan Dufraisse,Ahmad Chamma,Amr Mohamed,Dani Bouch,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Retaining easy problems during RLVR training acts as implicit length regularization, achieving baseline accuracy with solutions nearly twice as short without explicit length penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained for step-by-step reasoning become excessively verbose, increasing inference costs. Standard RLVR pipelines filter out easy problems, causing models to conflate longer reasoning with better reasoning.

Method: Retaining and modestly up-weighting moderately easy problems during RLVR training to act as implicit length regularizer, constraining output distribution and preventing verbosity.

Result: Achieved baseline pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions nearly twice as short on average, demonstrating emergent brevity without explicit length penalization.

Conclusion: Exposing models to solvable short-chain tasks during training effectively prevents runaway verbosity and achieves more efficient reasoning without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

### [32] [The Geometry of Grokking: Norm Minimization on the Zero-Loss Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01938)
*Tiberiu Musat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking is delayed generalization after memorization. The paper explains it as constrained optimization minimizing weight norms on the zero-loss manifold, proven theoretically and validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research linked grokking to weight decay but lacked clarity on the underlying dynamics.

Method: The paper uses constrained optimization theory, proves dynamics in small learning rate/weight decay limits, introduces a parameter decoupling approximation, and derives first-layer dynamics in two-layer networks.

Result: Experiments show simulated gradients reproduce delayed generalization and representation learning of grokking.

Conclusion: Post-memorization learning aligns with constrained optimization, providing a theoretical foundation for grokking dynamics.

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

*Guillaume Tejedor,Veronika Peralta,Nicolas Labroche,Patrick Marcel,Hélène Blasco,Hugo Alarcan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a clustering method using disease progression scores to group ALS patients, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in survival analysis while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS has limited treatments with variable patient responses, but research is hindered by small heterogeneous cohorts, sparse data, and lack of clear patient clusters. Existing clustering methods are limited.

Method: Clustering approach using disease progression declarative score, integrating medical expertise through descriptive variables. Investigated multiple distance measures including off-the-shelf distances and weak-supervised learning, paired with clustering methods.

Result: Evaluation on 353 ALS patients showed method outperforms state-of-the-art in survival analysis with comparable silhouette scores. Learned distances enhanced relevance and interpretability for medical experts.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering approach effectively groups ALS patients using disease progression scores, providing better survival analysis performance and improved interpretability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

### [34] [COFAP: A Universal Framework for COFs Adsorption Prediction through Designed Multi-Modal Extraction and Cross-Modal Synergy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01946)
*Zihan Li,Mingyang Wan,Mingyu Gao,Zhongshan Chen,Xiangke Wang,Feifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFAP is a deep learning framework that uses multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal attention for predicting gas adsorption in COFs, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring Henry coefficients or adsorption heat data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning methods for COF screening rely on time-consuming, gas-specific features that limit scalability and efficiency in high-throughput screening of COFs for gas adsorption applications.

Method: The COFAP framework extracts structural and chemical features from COFs using deep learning and fuses these complementary features through a cross-modal attention mechanism.

Result: COFAP outperforms previous approaches on the hypoCOFs dataset and identifies that high-performing COFs for separation are concentrated within narrow ranges of pore size and surface area.

Conclusion: COFAP offers superior efficiency and accuracy for high-throughput screening of crystalline porous materials, with a weight-adjustable prioritization scheme for flexible ranking of candidate COFs based on application-specific needs.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study creates a weighted ensemble combining tree-based models and CNN for CVD risk prediction, achieving improved performance (AUC 0.8371) and high recall (80%) with explainability features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease is a major global health issue requiring reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk assessment.

Method: Developed a strategically weighted ensemble model combining LightGBM, XGBoost, and CNN trained on 229,781 patient records with class imbalance handling and feature engineering (22 to 25 features).

Result: The ensemble achieved statistically significant improvement over individual models with Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and 80% recall, suitable for screening applications.

Conclusion: The model provides robust predictive performance combined with clinical transparency through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it suitable for real-world public health deployment.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

*Prasanth K K,Shubham Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EchoLSTM introduces Output-Conditioned Gating for self-reflection, enabling models to modulate memory gates based on past inferences, achieving superior performance on long-range dependencies while being more parameter-efficient than Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RNNs and LSTMs struggle with long-range dependencies in sequences with noisy or misleading information, requiring a more robust memory system.

Method: Proposed Output-Conditioned Gating principle that creates a stabilizing feedback loop by modulating internal memory gates based on past inferences, combined with an attention mechanism in EchoLSTM.

Result: EchoLSTM achieved 69.0% accuracy on Distractor Signal Task (33% improvement over LSTM baseline) and 69.8% on ListOps benchmark (competitive with Transformer's 71.8%) while being 5x more parameter-efficient. Trigger Sensitivity Test showed more robust memory.

Conclusion: Output-Conditioned Gating enables effective self-reflection in RNNs, creating robust memory systems that handle long-range dependencies better than standard LSTMs while maintaining parameter efficiency comparable to Transformers.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

### [37] [EvoMem: Improving Multi-Agent Planning with Dual-Evolving Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01912)
*Wenzhe Fan,Ning Yan,Masood Mortazavi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: EvoMem is a multi-agent framework with dual-evolving memory that improves planning performance across tasks like trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The role of human-like memory in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks remains largely unexplored, despite memory being critical for natural language planning involving iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction.

Method: EvoMem uses a dual-evolving memory mechanism with three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (evolves across queries) and Query-feedback Memory (evolves within queries). Both memories reset after each query session.

Result: Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The success of EvoMem underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning capabilities.

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

*Manonmani Sekar,Nasim Nezamoddini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A GAT-SAC framework combining Graph Attention Networks with Soft Actor-Critic reinforcement learning for adaptive traffic signal control at multilane intersections, achieving significant improvements in delay reduction, safety, and fairness between human-driven and autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at multilane intersections, requiring adaptive signal control that can handle mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Method: Uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to model dynamic graph-structured traffic flow capturing spatial-temporal dependencies, combined with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning for entropy-optimized adaptive signal control that coordinates timing and vehicle movement simultaneously.

Result: Achieved 24.1% reduction in average delay, up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to traditional methods, and improved fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.

Conclusion: The GAT-SAC framework demonstrates significant promise for real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems, effectively coordinating HDVs and CAVs while optimizing travel time, performance, safety, and fairness.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is
ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control
framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model
the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and
temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a
robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal
control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the
system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with
objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring
safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated
using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%
reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs
improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.
These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for
real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

*Beyazit Yalcinkaya,Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte,Ameesh Shah,Hanna Krasowski,Sanjit A. Seshia*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ACC-MARL framework enables learning task-conditioned decentralized policies for multi-agent systems with temporal objectives, addressing sample inefficiency and single-task limitations through automata-based task decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multi-agent reinforcement learning with temporal objectives are sample-inefficient and limited to single-task scenarios, lacking the ability to handle complex cooperative tasks that require multi-step coordination.

Method: Proposed Automata-Conditioned Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL) framework that uses automata to decompose complex temporal tasks into simpler sub-tasks, enabling centralized training of decentralized policies with task conditioning.

Result: The approach enables emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents (e.g., pressing buttons, holding doors, short-circuiting tasks) and allows optimal task assignment at test time using learned value functions.

Conclusion: ACC-MARL successfully addresses the challenges of multi-task multi-agent learning with temporal objectives, providing a practical framework for decentralized execution while maintaining the benefits of centralized training.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.
