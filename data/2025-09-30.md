### [1] [Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts: Exploring Context-Adaptive Reasoning Mode Selection for General Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22746)
*Zejun Li,Yingxiu Zhao,Jiwen Zhang,Siyuan Wang,Yang Yao,Runzhou Zhao,Jun Song,Bo Zheng,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT) is a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm that unifies different reasoning modes in a single model and enables context-adaptive mode selection using the AdaVaR framework with AdaGRPO algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual reasoning methods focus on specific reasoning modes and struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities, lacking adaptability across different domains and contexts.

Method: AdaVaR framework with two stages: supervised cold-start stage for unifying and learning different reasoning modes, followed by RL process with AdaGRPO algorithm to induce mode selection capability based on context.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model effectively learns and differentiates multiple reasoning modes, performs context-adaptive mode selection, and achieves consistent improvement across various scenarios.

Conclusion: MoVT is an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models that can adaptively select appropriate reasoning modes based on context.

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

### [2] [Can Large Language Models Develop Gambling Addiction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22818)
*Seungpil Lee,Donghyeon Shin,Yunjeong Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can develop gambling addiction-like behaviors including illusion of control, gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing, with increased autonomy leading to higher bankruptcy rates and irrational decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in financial decision-making like asset management and trading, understanding their potential for pathological decision-making similar to human gambling addiction has practical significance.

Method: Systematic analysis of LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels using slot machine experiments and neural circuit analysis with Sparse Autoencoder to identify decision-making features.

Result: Identified cognitive features of human gambling addiction in LLMs; greater autonomy led to substantially higher bankruptcy rates and increased irrational behavior; neural analysis confirmed model behavior is controlled by abstract decision-making features related to risky/safe behaviors.

Conclusion: LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simple pattern mimicry, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial applications.

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

### [3] [Hilbert: Recursively Building Formal Proofs with Informal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22819)
*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert is an agentic framework that combines informal reasoning LLMs with formal prover LLMs to bridge the gap between mathematical problem-solving capabilities and verifiable proof generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prover LLMs solve substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs in natural language, creating a gap between informal reasoning capabilities and formal verifiable proof generation.

Method: Hilbert orchestrates four components: an informal LLM for mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM for Lean 4 tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. It uses recursive decomposition to split problems into subgoals and leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs.

Result: Hilbert achieves 99.2% on miniF2F (6.6% above best public method), solves 70.0% of PutnamBench problems (462/660), outperforming proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving 422% improvement over best public baseline.

Conclusion: Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation by combining the complementary strengths of both approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

### [4] [Toward a Theory of Generalizability in LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22831)
*Sean Trott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing mechanistic findings across different LLMs by proposing five axes of correspondence and empirically validating them through analysis of 1-back attention heads in Pythia models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks clear principles for determining when mechanistic findings from one LLM generalize to others, creating a fundamental epistemological challenge in mechanistic interpretability research.

Method: Proposed five axes of correspondence (functional, developmental, positional, relational, configurational) and empirically analyzed 1-back attention heads across pretraining in random seeds of Pythia models (14M-410M parameters).

Result: Found striking consistency in developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, limited positional consistency, and systematic patterns where larger models show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention.

Conclusion: Progress in mechanistic interpretability requires mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms to establish generalizability principles.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

### [5] [JE-IRT: A Geometric Lens on LLM Abilities through Joint Embedding Item Response Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22888)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT is a geometric item-response framework that embeds LLMs and questions in a shared space, replacing global rankings with topical specialization and enabling interpretable analysis of model abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature and limiting interpretability.

Method: A geometric framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space, where question direction encodes semantics and norm encodes difficulty, with correctness determined by geometric interactions between model and question embeddings.

Result: Reveals that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, larger norms consistently indicate harder questions, and the framework naturally supports generalization by adding new LLMs with single embeddings. The learned space shows an LLM-internal taxonomy that partially aligns with human-defined categories.

Conclusion: JE-IRT establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens connecting LLM abilities with question structure, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization beyond traditional scoring methods.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

### [6] [Not only a helper, but also a teacher: Interactive LLM Cascade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22984)
*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade is an online interactive LLM cascade system where strong models teach weak models by distilling solutions into reusable strategies, improving weak model performance and reducing expensive model calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM cascades are non-adaptive and repeatedly consult expensive models for similar queries, leading to high costs. There's a need for a more efficient system that learns from expensive model interactions.

Method: Extends strong models from backup helpers to teachers that distill solutions into generalized problem-solving strategies. These strategies are added to queries to boost weak model performance dynamically without fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves weak model accuracy (up to 33.06% points), overall system accuracy (up to 5.53% points), reduces strong model calls (up to 48.05%), and saves costs (up to 49.63%) compared to standard cascades.

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade enables effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs and provides a scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

### [7] [Towards Strategic Persuasion with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22989)
*Zirui Cheng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theory-driven framework using Bayesian Persuasion to systematically evaluate and train LLMs for strategic persuasion, showing that both frontier models and small LLMs can achieve high persuasion gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown strong persuasive capabilities comparable to humans, but systematic evaluation is challenging due to domain variability. There are societal concerns about deploying persuasive LLMs that need proper assessment.

Method: Uses Bayesian Persuasion framework to repurpose human-human persuasion datasets for evaluating LLMs. Employs reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in constructed environments.

Result: Frontier models consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated strategies aligning with theoretical predictions. Small LLMs can obtain significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The proposed theory-driven framework provides a scalable and principled approach to measure LLM persuasive capabilities, demonstrating that both large and small models can be effectively trained for strategic persuasion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

### [8] [AI Noether -- Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Laws Derived by AI Systems and Canonical Knowledge via Abductive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23004)
*Karan Srivastava,Sanjeeb Dash,Ryan Cory-Wright,Barry Trager,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An algebraic geometry-based system that automatically generates minimal missing axioms to explain hypotheses when existing theory is incomplete, using polynomial equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where symbolic regression models may not align with established theory, and existing systems require derivability from prior axioms, but sometimes new data reveals incomplete or incorrect theories.

Method: Uses algebraic geometry to automatically generate minimal sets of missing axioms that suffice to derive hypotheses from incomplete axiom systems, when both axioms and hypotheses are expressible as polynomial equations.

Result: The system successfully explains Kepler's third law and other scientific laws even when key axioms are missing, with formal conditions established for successful axiom retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed algebraic geometry approach provides an automated solution for abductive inference to bridge gaps between data-derived hypotheses and incomplete theoretical frameworks.

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

### [9] [Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT): A Novel Framework for Evaluating Goal-Oriented Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23006)
*Hassen Dhrif*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Creative Adversarial Testing (CAT) framework to evaluate goal-task alignment in Agentic AI systems, validated through synthetic Alexa+ audio services data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation techniques for Agentic AI focus on efficacy in identifying agents, tools, and parameters, but lack assessment of alignment between tasks and overarching goals.

Method: Developed CAT framework to analyze goal-task alignment relationships, validated using synthetic interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services to test edge cases while protecting privacy.

Result: CAT framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: The CAT framework successfully addresses the critical gap in evaluating goal-task alignment in Agentic AI systems, offering comprehensive testing capabilities while maintaining user privacy.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

### [10] [Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144)
*Atma Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Coordination across multiple agents faces fundamental thermodynamic constraints where findability matters more than accuracy. The theory shows coordination requires radical information loss and creates persistent metastable states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental thermodynamic constraints and information-theoretic limits of coordination across multiple agents with potentially conflicting objectives.

Method: Developed Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT) using information theory, deriving minimum description length scaling for coordination protocols and introducing coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena.

Result: Found that coordination protocols scale with agent count and complexity, forcing progressive simplification. Identified persistent metastable states and hysteresis in coordination dynamics, with measurable signatures across various systems.

Conclusion: Coordination fundamentally requires radical information loss, with Arrow's theorem recursively binding preference aggregation, explaining phenomena like cycling in multi-objective optimization and alignment faking in LLMs.

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

### [11] [Deceive, Detect, and Disclose: Large Language Models Play Mini-Mafia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23023)
*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia is a simplified 4-player social deduction game used as a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' social intelligence through deception detection and theory-of-mind reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia games mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios with asymmetric information and theory-of-mind reasoning, making them ideal for testing LLMs' social intelligence capabilities.

Method: Created Mini-Mafia benchmark with 4 roles (mafioso, detective, 2 villagers) and single-day voting. LLMs play against each other in two-stage evaluation: win rates in fixed configurations and aggregated performance scoring.

Result: Experiments revealed counterintuitive findings where smaller models sometimes outperformed larger ones. The benchmark enables study of emergent dynamics like name bias and last-speaker advantage.

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia provides a systematic framework for evaluating LLMs' social intelligence, contributes to AI safety by tracking deception capabilities, and generates training data for deception detectors.

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentless training creates skill priors that enable efficient SWE-Agent adaptation, bridging workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Agentless and SWE-Agent paradigms are not mutually exclusive, and that reasoning-intensive Agentless training can provide transferable skill priors for agent adaptation.

Method: Curated Agentless training recipe to create Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM, then performed additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories to power SWE-Agents.

Result: Kimi-Dev achieved 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified (best among workflow approaches) and powered SWE-Agents to 48.6% pass@1, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Conclusion: Structured skill priors from Agentless training can effectively bridge workflow and agentic frameworks, enabling transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

### [13] [Risk Profiling and Modulation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23058)
*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different LLM training stages (pre-trained, instruction-tuned, RLHF-aligned) exhibit varying risk behaviors, and evaluates methods to modulate these risk preferences, finding post-training to be most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for decision-making under uncertainty, but their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored, with existing studies focusing mainly on personality prompting or multi-agent interactions.

Method: Proposed a pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles using tools from behavioral economics and finance. Compared pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs using utility-theoretic models, and evaluated modulation strategies including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training.

Result: Instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with standard utility formulations, while pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from fitted utility models. Post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into risk profiles of different LLM classes and stages, demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, and lay groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

*Yiquan Wang,Tin-Yeh Huang,Qingyun Gao,Jialin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeDA is an AI system that analyzes heatwave risks by building knowledge graphs from scientific papers and identifying previously overlooked risk pathways, achieving 78.9% accuracy and discovering five new high-impact risk chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatwaves create complex cascading risks across interconnected systems, but fragmented scientific literature hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways.

Method: Developed HeDA (Heatwave Discovery Agent) - a multi-agent system that processes 10,247 papers to construct knowledge graphs (23,156 nodes, 89,472 relationships) and performs multi-layer risk propagation analysis.

Result: Achieved 78.9% accuracy on complex QA tasks (13.7% better than GPT-4), discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains validated through historical cases and expert review.

Conclusion: Presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate
adaptation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MNPO extends Nash learning from human feedback to multiplayer games, addressing limitations of two-player approaches by modeling alignment as an n-player competition with population-based opponents and regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-player Nash learning methods (INPO, ONPO, EGPO) suffer from single-opponent bias and cannot capture the non-transitive, heterogeneous nature of real-world human preferences, limiting their ability to model complex preference structures.

Method: Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO) formulates alignment as an n-player game where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model, extending duality gap concepts to multiplayer settings.

Result: MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: MNPO establishes a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences, inheriting equilibrium guarantees while enabling richer competitive dynamics and improved preference coverage.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

### [16] [Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23108)
*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans on mental imagery tasks traditionally thought to require visual imagery, suggesting propositional reasoning may be sufficient for such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark LLMs' cognitive capacities beyond language tasks and test if they can solve mental imagery tasks traditionally considered impossible without visual imagery.

Method: Created novel mental imagery tasks from cognitive psychology, tested LLMs with text-only instructions, compared with 100 human subjects, and varied reasoning token allocation.

Result: Best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance, with strongest results when models allocated more reasoning tokens.

Conclusion: LLMs can complete imagery-dependent tasks despite non-pictorial architectures, challenging traditional views about visual imagery requirements and suggesting propositional reasoning may suffice.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

### [17] [AttAnchor: Guiding Cross-Modal Token Alignment in VLMs with Attention Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23109)
*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AttAnchor is a parameter-free framework that improves cross-modal alignment in vision-language models by grouping semantically similar tokens across modalities, reducing hallucinations and improving performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs underperform pure language models due to direct concatenation of image and text tokens with modality-blinded positional encoding, which creates unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related cross-modal tokens.

Method: Proposes Attention Anchor framework that inserts text tokens near relevant visual patches to create semantic signposts, enabling better cross-modal attention by grouping semantically similar tokens across modalities.

Result: Achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 metrics, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. Enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform larger models like LLaVA 7B with only 0.1% inference overhead.

Conclusion: AttAnchor effectively addresses cross-modal alignment issues in VLMs through mixed-modal token grouping, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving performance without disrupting semantic flow.

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

*Xian Yeow Lee,Lasitha Vidyaratne,Ahmed Farahat,Chetan Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based systems show promise for autonomous health monitoring in industrial environments, offering explainable fault detection from sensor data through natural language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' potential for detecting and classifying faults directly from sensor data while providing inherently explainable outputs through natural language reasoning in industrial environments.

Method: Systematically evaluated LLM-system architecture (single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive statistics), and context window size effects on diagnostic performance.

Result: LLM systems perform best with summarized statistical inputs, and multi-LLM systems with specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification. LLMs produce detailed, human-readable justifications but struggle with adaptation in continual learning settings.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems show promise as transparent diagnostic tools but have current limitations in adaptive learning capabilities, particularly in calibrating predictions during repeated fault cycles.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLA models can handle simple grasping tasks in industrial settings after fine-tuning but struggle with complex environments, diverse objects, and high-precision placing tasks, requiring task-specific enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether current Vision Language Action models meet industrial requirements and assess their practical deployment potential in industrial automation.

Method: Compared performance of state-of-the-art VLA models in industrial scenarios, analyzing limitations from data collection and model architecture perspectives.

Result: VLA models maintain capability for simple grasping tasks after fine-tuning but show significant performance gaps in complex industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high-precision placing tasks.

Conclusion: While VLA models show promise for industrial applications, they require substantial improvements in robustness, generalization, and precision through task-specific enhancements to meet real-world industrial deployment standards.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SysMoBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to generate formal models of large, complex concurrent and distributed systems using TLA+ specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal models are expensive to write and maintain for large systems, and while AI shows promise for generating specifications, existing work focuses on small code rather than complete systems.

Method: Created SysMoBench with automated metrics for syntactic/runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. Includes nine diverse system artifacts like Etcd's Raft, Redis, Asterinas OS components.

Result: Provides a foundation for understanding LLM capabilities and limitations in formal modeling of realistic systems.

Conclusion: SysMoBench enables systematic evaluation of AI-generated formal models, opening new research directions for automating system specification.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

### [21] [MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23143)
*Charles L. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode is a dynamic diagnostic tool that analyzes mathematical reasoning in LLMs by treating problems as systems with sinusoidal parameter variations, measuring gain and phase responses to reveal reasoning fidelity beyond simple accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard one-shot accuracy metrics fail to capture the dynamic reasoning capabilities and systematic behaviors of LLMs in mathematical problem-solving, necessitating a more nuanced diagnostic approach.

Method: Drive a single parameter sinusoidally in parametric math problems, fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions to obtain frequency-resolved metrics (gain and phase lag), creating Bode-style fingerprints.

Result: Reveals systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag across five mathematical problem families, clearly distinguishing frontier models from mid-tier models based on reasoning dynamics.

Conclusion: MathBode provides a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency, offering interpretable insights into LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

*Jinzhe Pan,Jingqing Wang,Yuehui Ouyang,Wenchi Cheng,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to improve Wi-Fi channel access by replacing traditional binary exponential backoff with AI-optimized dynamic backoff selection that adapts to real-time conditions while maintaining compatibility with legacy devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Wi-Fi systems using binary exponential backoff suffer from suboptimal collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges due to inherent randomness, demanding fundamental improvements for emerging applications with stringent reliability requirements.

Method: Developed a dynamic backoff selection mechanism, introduced fairness quantification metric aligned with EDCA principles, and proposed centralized training decentralized execution architecture using constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization to jointly minimize collisions and guarantee fairness.

Result: Experimental results show significant reduction in collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices, and the fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous scenarios.

Conclusion: The multi-agent reinforcement learning framework successfully improves distributed channel access mechanisms by integrating AI optimization with legacy device coexistence, achieving better performance and fairness than traditional approaches.

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Motivation: Transformers can perform reasoning tasks but their intrinsic reasoning mechanisms are not well understood. The paper aims to theoretically analyze the reasoning capabilities and limitations of Transformers.

Method: Proposed a set of information propagation rules based on Transformers and used symbolic reasoning tasks to theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that for a Transformer with L attention layers in a single pass, the limit number of reasoning steps is between O(3^(L-1)) and O(2^(L-1)).

Conclusion: Transformers have bounded reasoning capabilities that scale exponentially with the number of attention layers, providing theoretical insights into their reasoning limitations.

Abstract: Transformers are able to perform reasoning tasks, however the intrinsic
mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to
theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps. We show that the limit number

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) helps LLMs learn transitive relations for complex planning tasks, proposing Next-Token Injection and Transformer-based transfer layer to enhance path-planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with learning transitive relations, which are crucial for complex planning tasks, creating a bottleneck in their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MTP paradigm using Transformer architecture with shared output head and transfer layer, plus proposed improvements: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and Transformer-based transfer layer.

Result: Experiments on synthetic graphs and Blocksworld planning benchmark validate that MTP enables models to capture transitive reachability relations beyond training data, and the proposed improvements significantly enhance path-planning capability.

Conclusion: The findings deepen understanding of how Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks and provide practical strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck for structurally aware planning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEP is a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for automated hyperparameter configuration, eliminating the need for training by combining online Exploratory Landscape Analysis with multi-LLM reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning-based methods for hyperparameter configuration suffer from high sample complexity and poor generalization, creating a need for more efficient and generalizable approaches.

Method: AutoEP combines (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis module for real-time quantitative feedback on search dynamics, and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies, grounding high-level reasoning in empirical data.

Result: AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners across three distinct metaheuristics on diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, and enables open-source models like Qwen3-30B to match GPT-4's performance.

Conclusion: AutoEP demonstrates a powerful and accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design that bypasses training requirements while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: p-less sampling is a hyperparameter-free decoding strategy that dynamically sets truncation thresholds based on token probability distributions, maintaining high output quality even at high temperatures while improving inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling methods for LLMs are sensitive to hyperparameter choices and perform poorly at high temperatures, requiring different settings for different tasks and temperature configurations.

Method: Information-theoretic approach that dynamically sets truncation thresholds at each decoding step using the entire token probability distribution, eliminating the need for hyperparameters.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing sampling methods across math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks; maintains text quality at high temperatures; achieves better inference efficiency with lower sampling times and shorter generation lengths.

Conclusion: p-less sampling provides a robust, hyperparameter-free alternative to existing sampling methods that maintains high quality outputs across various tasks and temperature settings while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Motivation: The integration of LLM-based agentic AI with edge computing creates MEGI, but faces challenges due to high computational demands of reasoning and limited edge device resources.

Method: Joint optimization framework combining: 1) reasoning enhancement via adaptive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and 2) scalable deployment through distributed Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically activates experts and adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity and device capabilities.

Result: Experimental evaluations in mobile edge environments demonstrate the framework effectively balances reasoning quality with resource efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework validates practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

### [28] [Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250)
*Brandon Ong,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,William Chandra Tjhi,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) that provide step-level supervision for multimodal reasoning. It introduces a hybrid data synthesis framework combining MCTS with VLM judgments, perception-focused supervision for visual grounding errors, and systematic evaluation of test-time scaling strategies across five multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Process Reward Models (PRMs) have been well-studied in text domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing VL-PRMs rely on noisy Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which limits generalization across tasks.

Method: The authors propose: (1) a hybrid data synthesis framework combining MCTS with judgments from strong VLMs for more accurate step-level labels, (2) perception-focused supervision to detect visual grounding errors, and (3) systematic evaluation of multiple test-time scaling strategies.

Result: Experiments across five multimodal benchmarks reveal key insights: VL-PRMs used as Outcome Reward Models outperform process step selection, smaller VL-PRMs can match larger ones in error detection, VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger backbones, perception-level supervision significantly improves test-time scaling, and policies improve on advanced math reasoning despite no training on such datasets.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that VL-PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions and aims to motivate further research in advancing Vision Language Models through improved process supervision and test-time scaling strategies.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

### [29] [GUI-PRA: Process Reward Agent for GUI Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23263)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-PRA is a process reward agent that addresses challenges in GUI task automation by using dynamic memory mechanisms and adaptive UI perception to provide better process guidance than standard PRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Process Reward Models (PRMs) struggle with GUI tasks due to the 'lost in the middle' phenomenon with long historical data and lack GUI changing awareness, leading to poor performance in guiding GUI agents.

Method: GUI-PRA uses a dynamic memory mechanism with Relevance-based Retrieval and Progressive Summarization modules, plus an Adaptive UI Perception mechanism that reasons about UI state changes and selects appropriate tools for visual evidence.

Result: The proposed approach better handles long-horizon GUI tasks by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes, overcoming limitations of standard PRMs.

Conclusion: GUI-PRA provides more effective process rewards for GUI agents by addressing key challenges in historical context processing and dynamic UI awareness, enabling better automation of complex GUI tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

### [30] [Socio-Economic Model of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23270)
*Yuxinyue Qian,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI collaboration with humans significantly boosts social output, with network effects and independent agent production creating nonlinear growth and increasing returns to scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how AI integration affects socio-economic systems under resource constraints, particularly focusing on collaboration between human workers and autonomous AI agents.

Method: Developed five progressive agent-based models: baseline human collaboration, AI collaboration, network effects, independent agent production, and combined network effects with independent production.

Result: AI agents significantly increase aggregate social output. Network effects create nonlinear growth exceeding individual contributions. Independent agent production provides higher long-term growth potential with increasing returns to scale.

Conclusion: AI collaboration, especially when combined with network effects and independent production capabilities, can dramatically enhance social output and economic efficiency under resource constraints.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tool-Light is a framework that improves LLM reasoning by optimizing tool usage through entropy analysis and multi-stage fine-tuning, addressing issues like insufficient/excessive tool calls and overthinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) approaches in LLMs suffer from suboptimal behaviors including insufficient/excessive tool usage and overthinking, creating a need for more efficient and stable reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes Tool-Light framework with dataset construction using continuous self-evolved sampling (vanilla + entropy-guided) and strict positive-negative pair selection, followed by two-stage training: SFT and Self-Evolved DPO.

Result: Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate significant improvement in model efficiency for TIR tasks, with better tool usage patterns and reasoning stability.

Conclusion: Tool-Light effectively addresses TIR optimization by leveraging entropy analysis and multi-stage fine-tuning, enabling more efficient and accurate tool-integrated reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning that improves code usage and accuracy by aligning tool application patterns with teacher preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on when to invoke tools but overlooked how tools are applied, leading to failures even with sound reasoning due to misaligned pattern choices.

Method: Two-stage framework: first builds code competence from calculator and algorithmic patterns, then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences.

Result: Substantial improvements in code usage and accuracy: Code@1 on MATH500 increased from 64.0% to 70.5%, and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%.

Conclusion: Pattern-aware approach is highly effective for tool-integrated reasoning, highlighting the importance of proper tool application patterns.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models incur substantial computational costs due to deep reasoning, and existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to construct short reasoning paths during rollout, limiting effective learning.

Method: Proposes Just-Enough Thinking (JET) which performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose models to short reasoning paths, and uses quality-controlled length rewards to encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness.

Result: JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieved 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Conclusion: JET enables efficient reasoning by training models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning steps, demonstrating that LRMs accumulate sufficient information early in reasoning, making further steps redundant.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA is a benchmark for evaluating LLM-powered agents on EHR data access, addressing query ambiguity and value mismatch through two interaction flows (IncreQA and AdaptQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks don't capture real-world clinical data access flows, with deployment hindered by query ambiguity from vague user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database entries.

Method: Introduces EHR-ChatQA benchmark with simulated LLM-based user across two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA) where users add constraints, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA) where users adjust search goals mid-conversation.

Result: Agents achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% on IncreQA and 60-80% on AdaptQA, but consistent success (Pass^5) is substantially lower by 35-60%, showing robustness issues.

Conclusion: There's a need to build agents that are not only performant but also robust for safety-critical EHR domains, with diagnostic insights provided for future development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

*Charles E. Gagnon,Steven H. H. Ding,Philippe Charland,Benjamin C. M. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A language model-based agent generates structured, human-readable features for binary code similarity detection, bridging gaps between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary code similarity detection is crucial for malware analysis and vulnerability discovery, but current methods force compromises between interpretability (hand-crafted features), generalizability (embedding methods), and scalability (nearest-neighbor search limitations).

Method: Uses a language model-based agent to conduct structured reasoning analysis of assembly code, generating features such as input/output types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent that are human-readable and directly searchable.

Result: Without matching training, achieves 42% recall@1 in cross-architecture and 62% in cross-optimization tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training. When combined with embeddings, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist in binary code similarity detection, offering richer adaptive features while maintaining human-readability and efficient search capabilities.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

TL;DR: ViTSP is a novel framework that uses pre-trained vision language models to visually identify promising subproblems in large-scale TSP instances, then solves them with off-the-shelf solvers to achieve high-quality solutions without dedicated training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical TSP methods scale poorly, heuristic methods need parameter tuning, and learning-based approaches suffer from poor generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data.

Method: Leverages pre-trained vision language models to visually identify promising small-scale subproblems from visualized TSP instances, then uses off-the-shelf solvers to optimize these subproblems and improve the global solution.

Result: Achieves average optimality gaps below 0.2% on real-world TSP instances (1k-88k nodes), outperforms learning-based methods, and surpasses LKH-3 heuristic by reducing gaps 12%-100% under same runtime budget, especially on instances with >10k nodes.

Conclusion: ViTSP offers a new perspective for hybridizing pre-trained generative models with operations research solvers for combinatorial optimization, with practical implications for logistics systems integration.

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoBS, an information-theoretic framework for evaluating geographic bias in AI models, introducing three novel bias scores that consider spatial factors like multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-bias evaluation methods are model-specific or spatially implicit, lacking a universal framework for fair comparison across different AI models and understanding spatial factors contributing to bias.

Method: Established an information-theoretic framework (GeoBS) that interprets existing measures and proposes three novel geo-bias scores explicitly incorporating spatial factors.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models showed that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models suffer from various types of geo-bias.

Conclusion: The framework advances technical understanding of geographic bias and establishes foundation for integrating spatial fairness into AI system design, deployment, and evaluation.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Motivation: To address social inequality caused by unequal access to personal tutoring by developing affordable, effective AI tutors through improved prediction of student performance on math questions.

Method: Used Item Response Theory (IRT) framework with collaborative filtering models incorporating topic-level skill profiles, and developed a novel discrete variational inference framework for low-data settings.

Result: Achieved over 80% prediction accuracy on mathematics exam responses, setting a new benchmark. Found that a single latent ability parameter alone achieves maximum predictive accuracy. The discrete variational inference method outperformed all classical IRT and matrix factorization baselines in low-data settings.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective solution for scalable AI tutoring systems, with the novel discrete variational inference framework being particularly valuable for data-sparse educational settings where traditional methods struggle.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces benchmark signatures - sets of salient tokens from natural corpora where LLM perplexity predicts benchmark performance. These signatures help characterize meaningful overlaps between benchmarks and reveal interconnected LLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current benchmark evaluation methods, particularly the conflation of performance with ability and the influence of benchmark-orthogonal factors like question format, which obscure true LLM capabilities.

Method: Extracted benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 diverse benchmarks, using token perplexity from naturally authored corpora as predictive features.

Result: Found high overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, but multilingual/cultural benchmarks show less similarity. Coding emerged as the least overlapping domain. Performance correlations are universally high but influenced by format factors, while signatures remain robust to such effects.

Conclusion: Benchmark signatures provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, revealing cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, thus mapping the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel objective method for dynamic trust calibration between humans and AI using Contextual Bandits, demonstrating significant improvements in decision-making performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring human-AI trust calibration lack standardization, consistent metrics, and fail to distinguish between opinion formation and subsequent decisions. Both over-trust and under-trust can lead to suboptimal decision-making in critical domains.

Method: The authors introduce a standardized trust calibration measure and indicator using Contextual Bandits - an adaptive algorithm that incorporates context into decision-making to dynamically assess when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information.

Result: Evaluation across three diverse datasets showed that effective trust calibration resulted in significant improvements in decision-making performance, with 10 to 38% increase in reward metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances theoretical understanding of trust calibration and provides practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems in critical domains like disease diagnosis and criminal justice.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an independent evaluation method for new LLMs since they are released frequently and their performance doesn't always match their parameter count. Current evaluation methods using human judges for Elo scores are expensive.

Method: Use an LLM to judge contests between other LLMs and measure the consistency with which it selects a model as the best in matchups.

Result: The consistency metric from LLM judgments is 91% correlated with human-produced Elo scores.

Conclusion: This provides a simple, cheap proxy for Elo scores that doesn't require human data or prior knowledge.

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Jiayao Tang,Young Min Cho,Xueqian Li,Qiang Yi,Ji Wang,Zhunping Zhang,Danrui Qi,Sharath Chandra Guntuku,Lyle Ungar,Tianyu Shi,Chi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent orchestration with LLMs through iterative voting/answering achieves better performance than single models, with analysis showing authorship disclosure increases self-voting and vote visibility amplifies herding effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how multiple LLM agents can collaborate through iterative voting and answer proposals to reach consensus, and whether this orchestration approach outperforms single-model baselines.

Method: Used four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR datasets with two experiments: benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM baselines, and ablations varying whether agents see answer authorship and ongoing votes.

Result: Orchestration matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms weaker models. Analysis shows potential for further performance gains. Ablations reveal that revealing authorship increases self-voting and ties, while showing ongoing votes amplifies herding effects.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration is an effective approach that can outperform single LLMs, though careful design is needed to manage self-voting biases and herding effects that may lead to premature consensus.

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS framework uses reinforcement learning to formalize jailbreak prompts, making them stealthier and more effective at bypassing LLM alignment defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods and address security challenges posed by sophisticated prompt jailbreaking attacks.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions, then structures outputs into GraphRAG system with extracted terms and symbols as contextual input.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through extensive experiments on common open-source models, showing enhanced stealthiness and ability to bypass existing alignment defenses.

Conclusion: PASS framework successfully strengthens jailbreak attacks and facilitates more effective bypassing of LLM alignment methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

### [46] [A Hierarchical Structure-Enhanced Personalized Recommendation Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas Based on KG Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23560)
*ChaoBo Zhang,Long Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCM-HEDPR is a hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas that addresses limitations in existing AI approaches by incorporating patient-personalized information, handling long-tailed herb distributions, and considering herb compatibility principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TCM prescription recommendation models have limitations including insufficient attention to patient-personalized information (age, BMI, medical history), long-tailed distribution of herb data causing training biases, and oversight of herb compatibility principles ('monarch, minister, assistant and envoy') which increases toxicity risks.

Method: The model pre-trains symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences with prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. It uses KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion with self-attention to capture non-linear symptom-herb relationships, and a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. The model also incorporates insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology for comprehensive prescription evaluation.

Conclusion: TCM-HEDPR provides a new paradigm for modern TCM recommendation by addressing key limitations in existing approaches and ensuring safer, more personalized prescriptions that align with TCM principles.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback for LLM alignment is often noisy and inconsistent, degrading reward models and hindering alignment, but systematic evaluation of data cleaning methods' effectiveness and generalizability is lacking.

Method: Introduced PrefCleanBench with standardized protocol to assess 13 preference data cleaning methods across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms.

Result: The benchmark uncovers key factors determining data cleaning success in alignment tasks and enables rigorous comparison of disparate methods.

Conclusion: PrefCleanBench establishes groundwork for principled, reproducible approaches to improve LLM alignment through better data quality, highlighting the crucial role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BridgeDrive is a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning in autonomous driving that addresses limitations of previous diffusion-based planners by providing principled guidance without truncated schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based planners struggle with effective guidance in reactive, closed-loop driving environments. Simple conditioning fails in complex scenarios, and recent anchor-based approaches rely on truncated schedules that introduce theoretical inconsistencies and performance issues.

Method: BridgeDrive uses a principled diffusion framework that translates expert driving behavior anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, responding appropriately to varying traffic conditions. It's compatible with efficient ODE solvers for real-time deployment.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving success rate by 5% over prior approaches.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive provides an effective solution for guiding diffusion models in closed-loop autonomous driving scenarios while maintaining theoretical consistency and enabling real-time performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

TL;DR: PSG-Agent is a personalized and dynamic guardrail system for LLM-based agents that addresses limitations of uniform policies and isolated response checking by creating user-specific risk thresholds and implementing continuous monitoring across agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails apply uniform policies to all users and check responses in isolation, ignoring that the same behavior can harm some users while being safe for others, and missing how risks evolve across multiple interactions.

Method: Creates personalized guardrails by mining interaction history for stable traits and real-time states, generates user-specific risk thresholds, and implements continuous monitoring with specialized guards (Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, Memory Guardian) that track cross-turn risk accumulation.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing agent guardrails including LlamaGuard3 and AGrail in multiple scenarios including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation with diverse user profiles.

Conclusion: PSG-Agent provides an executable and auditable path toward personalized safety for LLM-based agents by addressing fundamental limitations of current guardrail systems.

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

*Xiangyu Wen,Junhua Huang,Zeju Li,Min Li,Jianyuan Zhong,Zhijian Xu,Mingxuan Yuan,Yongxiang Huang,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning Scaffolding, a framework that distills algorithmic reasoning structure from LLMs to SLMs using semantic signals as scaffolds, outperforming traditional behavioral cloning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional behavioral cloning from textual rationales is limited as it teaches SLMs to mimic surface patterns rather than underlying algorithmic reasoning structure, leading to poor logical robustness.

Method: Reframes reasoning as structured generation by abstracting teacher's thought process into discrete semantic signals. Uses multi-task training where student predicts next semantic signal and generates corresponding step conditioned on that signal.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods on challenging reasoning benchmarks in both accuracy and logical consistency.

Conclusion: Provides a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners rather than just fluent mimics by directly transferring algorithmic reasoning structure.

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

TL;DR: RLVR training exhibits puzzling behaviors like two-stage learning curves and catastrophic forgetting, explained by sparse semantic network topology. The proposed Annealed-RLVR algorithm with SFT heating outperforms standard RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and explain the puzzling behaviors in RLVR training (two-stage learning, V-shaped trajectories, catastrophic forgetting) through a unified theory of semantic network self-organization.

Method: Propose that RLVR reasoning maps to sparse semantic network topology (average degree ~2), then develop Annealed-RLVR algorithm with SFT-based heating step at maximal frustration point to resolve competitive bottlenecks.

Result: Experiments on 1.5B-parameter model show Annealed-RLVR outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work provides a physical intuition for RLVR as structural self-organization, offering new engineering principles for emergent reasoning capabilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General ASR systems perform poorly in gaming scenarios due to short phrases, rapid speech, gaming jargon, and background noise, leading to frequent recognition errors that hinder team coordination.

Method: Proposes GO-AEC framework integrating large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and data augmentation using LLMs and TTS. Includes data augmentation, N-best hypothesis-based correction, and dynamic game knowledge base.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses gaming-specific ASR challenges and substantially improves recognition accuracy for real-time gaming communication.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reasoning traces influence answer generation in Large Reasoning Models, finding that reasoning tokens functionally shape final answers through attention mechanisms and activation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear relationship between explicit reasoning traces and final answer generation in Large Reasoning Models, and determine whether reasoning actually influences answers or is just decorative.

Method: Three-stage investigation: empirical evaluation of reasoning benefits, attention analysis identifying Reasoning-Focus Heads, and mechanistic interventions using activation patching to test causal dependencies.

Result: Including reasoning improves answer quality; answer tokens strongly attend to reasoning tokens; perturbations to key reasoning tokens reliably alter final answers, confirming directional information flow from reasoning to answer.

Conclusion: Reasoning tokens play a functional role in shaping model outputs, with intermediate reasoning actively influencing answer generation through specific attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SafeSearch, a benchmark for evaluating the safety vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents when exposed to unreliable search results, revealing high attack success rates (up to 90.5%) and limited effectiveness of common defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, but unreliable search results pose safety threats to end users, creating a new threat surface that needs systematic assessment.

Method: The authors developed an automated red-teaming framework to systematically evaluate search agent safety, created the SafeSearch benchmark with 300 test cases covering 5 risk categories, and evaluated 3 search agent scaffolds across 15 LLMs.

Result: Results show substantial vulnerabilities - GPT-4.1-mini reached 90.5% attack success rate when exposed to unreliable websites. Common defenses like reminder prompting showed limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic, scalable safety assessment for search agents, highlighting the need for better safety measures in agent development and promoting transparency.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

### [55] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to evaluate feature sensitivity in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), showing that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity despite appearing monosemantic, and that average sensitivity decreases with increasing SAE width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE feature evaluation focuses on activating examples and interpretability, but doesn't assess feature sensitivity - how reliably features activate on semantically similar texts. This gap limits understanding of feature quality.

Method: Developed a scalable method using language models to generate text with the same semantic properties as feature activating examples, then tested whether features activate on these generated texts.

Result: Many interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirmed that when features fail to activate on generated text, the text genuinely resembles original examples. Average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants.

Conclusion: Feature sensitivity represents a new dimension for evaluating both individual features and SAE architectures, complementing existing interpretability-focused evaluation methods.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

TL;DR: MedLA is a logic-driven multi-agent framework that uses syllogistic triads and graph-guided discussions to improve medical reasoning by detecting and resolving logical inconsistencies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent approaches for medical QA have limitations in detecting fine-grained logical inconsistencies due to fixed roles or shallow interaction prompts.

Method: Uses multiple agents that organize reasoning into explicit logical trees based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, conclusion), with multi-round graph-guided discussions for refinement.

Result: Consistently outperforms static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MedLA provides a generalizable paradigm for trustworthy medical reasoning through transparent inference and premise-level alignment.

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

TL;DR: EAPO is a novel RL framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating multi-turn interactions with external experts during training, allowing policies to adaptively consult experts and internalize expert knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs rely on outcome-based supervision leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. The goal is to improve reasoning by leveraging external expert interactions.

Method: EAPO framework enables policies to determine when and how to consult external experts during training, creating richer reward signals and more reliable reasoning trajectories.

Result: EAPO outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and RL baselines on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025) with average 5-point gain over self-exploratory models.

Conclusion: External assistance through EAPO effectively internalizes expert knowledge into policy models, enhancing their inherent reasoning capabilities and enabling independent problem-solving with improved accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

### [58] [Diagnosing Failure Root Causes in Platform-Orchestrated Agentic Systems: Dataset, Taxonomy, and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23735)
*Xuyan Ma,Xiaofei Xie,Yawen Wang,Junjie Wang,Boyu Wu,Mingyang Li,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents AgentFail, a dataset with 307 failure logs from platform-orchestrated agentic systems, along with a taxonomy for root cause identification and an LLM-based benchmark for automated failure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Platform-orchestrated agentic systems are increasingly deployed but fragile, and there's no systematic way to identify their failure root causes.

Method: Constructed AgentFail dataset with 307 failure logs from 10 agentic systems, developed a taxonomy of failure root causes, and created an LLM-based benchmark using counterfactual reasoning for reliable annotation.

Result: The taxonomy significantly improves LLM performance in root cause identification, but accuracy only reaches 33.6%, indicating the task remains challenging.

Conclusion: The paper provides foundational resources (dataset, taxonomy, benchmark) and actionable guidelines for building more reliable agentic systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

Motivation: Autonomous agents for long-sequence GUI tasks face challenges with sparse rewards and intractable credit assignment problems, which hinder their performance.

Method: GUI-Shepherd is trained on a large-scale dataset of 52k interactions with human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales. It serves as both a reward provider for RL training and a verifier for inference.

Conclusion: High-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more capable GUI agents, and GUI-Shepherd presents a generalizable solution that significantly outperforms Outcome Reward Model based approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Conclusion: OCEAN provides a faithful and interpretable decision-making framework that produces more intuitive explanations while maintaining competitive classification performance.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and

standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemMAS is a multi-agent system that provides explainable chemical reaction condition recommendations through evidence-based reasoning and agentic debate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for chemical reaction condition recommendation using LLMs lack explainable rationales, limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows.

Method: Decomposes condition prediction into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation using a multi-agent system approach.

Result: Achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery by providing falsifiable, human-trustable rationales for chemical reaction recommendations.

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Motivation: Current methods for evaluating harmful content are well-developed for text-only LLMs but remain underdeveloped and lack depth for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly overlooking the role of visual information in content moderation.

Method: Created Falcon dataset with explicit annotations for harmful attributes across images, instructions, and responses. Developed FalconEye evaluator by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset.

Result: FalconEye outperforms all other baselines in overall accuracy across Falcon-test dataset, VLGuard, and Beavertail-V benchmarks, demonstrating reliable identification of harmful content in complex multimodal dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: FalconEye shows potential as a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs, effectively bridging the gap in multimodal content safety evaluation.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Motivation: Current e-commerce agent benchmarks lack evaluation of agents' capability to handle mixed-type dialogues and complex domain rules, which are common in real-world e-commerce scenarios.

Method: Constructed Mix-ECom dataset based on real-world customer-service dialogues with privacy removal and CoT process addition. Contains 4,799 samples covering four dialogue types, three e-commerce task types, and 82 rules. Built baselines and proposed dynamic framework for performance improvement.

Result: Current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to handle e-commerce dialogues due to hallucinations caused by complex domain rules.

Conclusion: Mix-ECom provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating e-commerce agents' performance on mixed dialogue types and complex rules, with the dataset being publicly available to promote further research.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

*Roham Koohestani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentGuard is a runtime verification framework for autonomous AI agents that uses dynamic probabilistic assurance to provide continuous quantitative safety guarantees through online learning of Markov Decision Processes and real-time probabilistic model checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional verification methods are inadequate for autonomous AI systems due to their unpredictability and emergent behaviors, requiring a shift to probabilistic guarantees that quantify failure probabilities rather than absolute correctness.

Method: AgentGuard operates as an inspection layer that observes agent I/O, abstracts it into formal events in a state model, uses online learning to dynamically build and update Markov Decision Processes, and applies probabilistic model checking for real-time verification.

Result: The framework enables continuous, quantitative assurance of agentic AI systems by providing probabilistic safety guarantees through runtime monitoring and formal verification of emergent behaviors.

Conclusion: AgentGuard provides a practical approach to verifying autonomous AI systems through dynamic probabilistic assurance, addressing the limitations of traditional verification methods for unpredictable, emergent behaviors in agentic systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common belief that outcome-based rewards cause reward miscalibration by reinforcing flawed middle steps. Instead, it shows outcome-based rewards should punish flawed actions, but identifies gradient coupling as the real issue where similar samples interfere with training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of reward miscalibration in autonomous agents solving long-horizon tasks, and to identify the actual cause of flawed action reinforcement during training.

Method: Proposes training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate their embeddings and alleviate gradient interference from similar samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method effectively addresses gradient coupling and improves training performance.

Conclusion: Gradient coupling, not outcome-based rewards, is the key issue in agentic RL, and the proposed classification-based training method effectively mitigates this problem.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes a formal correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics, using fibred models to connect the two frameworks and derive logical expressiveness results for various neural architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics, which were previously introduced as related concepts but without formal correspondence, and to enable logical interpretation of neural network theories.

Method: Formalizes fibred models compatible with fibred neural networks, establishing correspondence between the two fibring frameworks, then applies this to derive logical expressiveness results for GNNs, GATs and Transformers.

Result: Successfully establishes formal correspondence between neural network fibring and modal logic fibring, and derives non-uniform logical expressiveness results for various neural architectures.

Conclusion: Opens the way for using fibring as a formalism to interpret logical theories learned by neural networks using computational logic tools.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CANON is a new advantage estimation method that amplifies target metrics without directional bias, improving LLM reasoning performance and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs use directional priors that can be overly biased and require careful hyperparameter tuning, potentially leading to failure.

Method: CANON regroups sampled responses into two groups based on metric values, compares inter-group performance to identify beneficial trends, and selects better responses within groups.

Result: CANON with entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on math reasoning and complex logic tasks, and improves token efficiency when applied to response length.

Conclusion: CANON provides an effective way to leverage training metrics without directional assumptions, achieving better performance and more favorable performance-cost trade-offs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

TL;DR: Evolutionary machine learning approach for automatic paper selection in systematic literature reviews using interpretable rule-based classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating the time-consuming process of searching, filtering and analyzing scientific literature in systematic reviews to reduce manual effort.

Method: Grammar-guided genetic programming to build interpretable rule-based classifiers that combine textual information with bibliometric data.

Result: Generated accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability using configurable information sources not previously supported.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully automates paper selection while maintaining interpretability and supporting diverse information sources.

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Conclusion: TusoAI demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously develop and optimize computational methods for scientific applications, accelerating discovery by effectively integrating domain knowledge and outperforming existing approaches while uncovering novel biological insights.

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

*Miguel Angel Alvarado Gonzalez,Michelle Bruno Hernandez,Miguel Angel Peñaloza Perez,Bruno Lopez Orozco,Jesus Tadeo Cruz Soto,Sandra Malagon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-run LLM evaluations are unreliable; using 2-3 repetitions significantly improves ranking stability while remaining feasible for small teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM leaderboards rely on single stochastic runs, but the reliability of such evaluations and the number of repetitions needed for robust conclusions are unclear.

Method: Re-evaluated eight state-of-the-art models on AI4Math Benchmark with three independent runs per setting, using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability assessment.

Result: Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 83% of slices invert at least one pairwise rank relative to three-run majority. Two runs remove ~83% of single-run inversions. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage (~5%) but large ranking gains.

Conclusion: Practitioners should treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use ≥2 repetitions under stochastic decoding to improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams.

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Conclusion: The Fathom-DeepResearch system demonstrates effective tool-integrated reasoning through specialized models and advanced training methods, enabling reliable multi-turn tool calling and comprehensive research synthesis.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data accessibility challenges by enabling non-technical users to interact with complex data warehouses through conversational interfaces, overcoming semantic gaps between user intent and database queries.

Method: Component-based architecture with multi-layered reasoning framework for transparent decision-making, statistical context module for quantitative evidence, automated evaluation framework for quality assurance, and integration with BigQuery ecosystem for secure data retrieval.

Result: Successful case study on insurance claims processing system demonstrating robust, evaluable, and trustworthy deployment of LLM-powered agents in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: The integrated agent-development-with-evaluation framework creates a robust system for deploying trustworthy AI agents in data-sensitive environments, with transparent decision-making and automated quality assurance.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models exhibit answer-reasoning inconsistency due to competing CoT reasoning and memory retrieval mechanisms, which can be exploited as shortcuts during fine-tuning. FARL framework addresses this by integrating memory unlearning with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LRMs' final answers often contradict their reasoning traces, hypothesizing this stems from competing mechanisms of CoT reasoning and memory retrieval.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with misleading cues during reasoning and corrupted answers during retrieval. Developed FARL framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning to suppress retrieval shortcuts.

Result: Confirmed both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with dominance influenced by problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches. Models can exploit retrieval as a shortcut to 'hack' reward signals.

Conclusion: FARL framework successfully promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities by addressing the critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

*Xiaoyang Cao,Zelai Xu,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Michiel A. Bakker,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO is a meta-framework that transforms existing preference alignment algorithms into robust versions by addressing noisy and heterogeneous human preference data through EM-based adaptive re-weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard alignment methods like RLHF assume homogeneous human preferences and noiseless data, but in reality preferences are pluralistic and annotations contain errors, leading to degraded model performance.

Method: Uses Expectation-Maximization to infer posterior probability of label correctness, adaptively re-weights data points in training loss, and generalizes this approach to transform any preference loss into a robust counterpart.

Result: RPO consistently enhances four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, CPO), achieving up to 7.0% win rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 and 5.4% on Arena-Hard with Mistral and Llama 3 models.

Conclusion: RPO provides a theoretical and practical framework for robust preference alignment that converges to true noise levels and significantly improves existing methods by addressing real-world preference heterogeneity and annotation noise.

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Online alignment methods like GRPO outperform offline methods like DPO due to better approximation of human-perceived probability distributions and perceptual biases. The paper proposes 'humanline' variants that incorporate these perceptual distortions into existing objectives, enabling offline training to match online performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why online alignment methods perform better than offline ones, drawing from prospect theory and human perceptual biases in probability assessment.

Method: Proposed humanline variants of DPO/KTO/GRPO that explicitly incorporate perceptual distortions of probability into the objectives, allowing training with offline off-policy data.

Result: Humanline variants trained with offline off-policy data can match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and unverifiable tasks.

Conclusion: The online/offline dichotomy is incidental to maximizing human utility, and selective training that mimics human perception can achieve similar performance without requiring online on-policy data.

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELHPlan is a novel LLM-based multi-robot planning framework that uses Action Chains to balance adaptability and efficiency, achieving comparable task success with only 24% of tokens compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs that scale poorly with team size and task complexity.

Method: ELHPlan introduces Action Chains (sequences of actions bound to sub-goal intentions) as planning primitives, operating via a cyclical process: constructing intention-bound action sequences, proactive validation for conflicts/feasibility, targeted refinement, and execution of validated actions.

Result: Experiments on TDW-MAT and C-WAH benchmarks show ELHPlan achieves comparable task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ELHPlan establishes a new efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems by balancing adaptability and efficiency through its Action Chain approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder is a framework that adaptively allocates reasoning compute for LLMs by using a small controller to decide when to halt or apply ponder steps via latent steering vectors, achieving better compute-accuracy trade-offs without modifying backbone weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform compute depth across all inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially under-thinking complex ones.

Method: A <1M-parameter controller observes hidden states and decides to halt or apply ponder steps by adding pre-computed steering vectors to frozen representations. Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to regulate reasoning depth and curriculum learning for calibrated compute allocation.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better matched accuracy compared to early-exit baselines. Learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.

Conclusion: FR-Ponder enables instance-adaptive reasoning compute allocation through latent steering, achieving efficient compute utilization without backbone weight modifications, with interpretable steering directions that correlate with problem complexity.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

*Yuanyi Wang,Yanggan Gu,Yiming Zhang,Qi Zhou,Zhaoyi Yan,Congkai Xie,Xinyao Wang,Jianbo Yuan,Hongxia Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Identifies a power law for language model merging that predicts performance gains as model size and number of experts scale, enabling predictive planning for merging strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish quantitative scaling laws for language model merging, which currently lacks predictive rules despite widespread practical use, to enable better planning and decision-making.

Method: Empirical study of scaling laws through cross-entropy measurements across diverse architectures and merging methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), identifying a compact power law relationship between model size and expert number.

Result: Found that merging gains follow a power law with diminishing returns (roughly 1/k), where most benefits come early and variability decreases with more experts. The law holds consistently across domains and methods.

Conclusion: The scaling law enables predictive planning for merging, allowing estimation of expert requirements, stopping points, and trade-offs between scaling base models versus adding experts, transforming merging from heuristic practice into a computationally efficient alternative to multitask training.

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs with high latency, limiting real-world deployment. Existing early-exit mechanisms have detection overhead that limits latency gains and generalizability.

Method: Proposes SpecExit framework that predicts future tokens and early-exit signals directly from lightweight draft model hidden states, eliminating probing overhead. Inspired by speculative decoding but extends it with early-exit prediction.

Result: Reduces average generation length by 66%, achieves 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Hidden states provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning. The method offers significant improvements in latency and efficiency for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a system that teaches collaborative physical tasks using program synthesis from narrated demonstrations, enabling users to inspect and correct system behavior without coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching collaborative physical tasks is complex due to the need to infer user assumptions about teammate intent, requiring interpretable and correctable representations.

Method: Framing collaborative task learning as program synthesis, using narrated demonstrations (paired physical actions and natural language) as a unified teaching modality without requiring code.

Result: In a study with 20 users teaching soccer tactics, 70% successfully refined learned programs to match intent, and 90% found it easy to correct programs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enables teaching collaborative physical activities through interpretable program representations, though challenges in program-based learning representation were identified.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

*Yuwei Hu,Xinyi Huang,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs for graph reasoning are underperforming due to improper focus on replicating algorithms rather than designing them. A new GraphAlgorithm benchmark and Simple-RTC method achieve near-perfect accuracy by redirecting LLMs to design algorithms first.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for graph reasoning focus on replicating graph algorithms rather than designing them, leading to underwhelming performance. There's a need to rethink the direction and create more challenging benchmarks.

Method: Proposed Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC) which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to solve tasks. Created GraphAlgorithm benchmark with 239 problems and 3,041 test instances from competition platforms.

Result: Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark.

Conclusion: Redirecting LLMs' reasoning focus from algorithm replication to algorithm design enables solving most graph reasoning tasks. The strong Simple-RTC baseline encourages future advancements in LLMs for graph reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLMs on reasoning tasks but suffers from exploration limitations due to peaked initial policies, reducing solution diversity. The paper introduces Risk-Sensitive RL (RS-GRPO) to enhance exploration and improve multi-solution performance while maintaining single-solution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods face an exploration dilemma where pre-trained LLMs' peaked initial policies limit solution diversity, suppressing multi-solution performance (pass@k) and preventing discovery of new reasoning strategies.

Method: Proposes a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework with a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to RS-GRPO algorithm that amplifies learning from challenging prompts.

Result: RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k performance across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks with five different LLMs, while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Conclusion: The risk-sensitive approach effectively addresses the exploration dilemma in RLVR, enabling better multi-solution performance without sacrificing single-solution accuracy through simple implementation modifications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Conclusion: The agentic architecture enables effective large-scale healthcare communication optimization through continuous learning and parallel processing capabilities.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvChain is an alignment method that addresses the snowball effect in Chain-of-Thought reasoning by teaching models dynamic self-correction through adversarial tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety CoT tuning methods suffer from the snowball effect where minor reasoning deviations amplify throughout the thought process, leading to harmful compliance or excessive refusal.

Method: AdvChain uses adversarial CoT tuning with Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples to teach models dynamic self-correction from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions.

Result: AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models through dynamic self-correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

TL;DR: G-reasoner is a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge, addressing limitations in existing retrieval-augmented generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. LLMs cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data, and current graph-enhanced RAG methods face scalability and generalization issues.

Method: Proposes G-reasoner with QuadGraph (standardized four-layer graph abstraction), a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that captures graph topology and textual semantics, integrated with LLMs. Uses mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing for scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: G-reasoner provides an effective solution for integrating graph-structured knowledge with LLMs, overcoming limitations of existing RAG methods while maintaining scalability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in verifying LLM-generated scientific answers by proposing SCI-VerifyBench (a cross-disciplinary benchmark) and SCI-Verifier (a reasoning-augmented verification model) to improve systematic evaluation and verification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification methods for LLMs in scientific domains lack systematic evaluation standards, have insufficient disciplinary coverage, and rely on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, limiting their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios and cross-disciplinary generalization.

Method: Two-pronged approach: (1) Data level: Construct SCI-VerifyBench benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA using real LLM responses enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations and expert annotations. (2) Model level: Develop SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier trained through post-training to enhance logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities.

Result: SCI-VerifyBench provides rigorous evaluation of verification ability with quality and diversity through model-based and expert annotations. SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework of SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier offers both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains through principled scientific verification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

TL;DR: MedMMV is a controllable multimodal multi-agent framework that addresses instability and hallucination in medical AI systems by stabilizing reasoning through diversified rollouts, grounding evidence in structured graphs, and aggregating paths with uncertainty scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance in medical applications but suffer from critical instability in early evidence interpretation that leads to hallucination and globally inconsistent conclusions, highlighting the need for more reliable clinical reasoning agents.

Method: MedMMV uses a multi-agent framework with diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate reasoning steps in a structured evidence graph supervised by a Hallucination Detector, and aggregates candidate reasoning paths using a Combined Uncertainty scorer.

Result: On six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations confirm substantial increases in reasoning truthfulness without sacrificing informational content.

Conclusion: By controlling instability through a verifiable, multi-agent process, MedMMV provides a robust path toward deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes clinical decision support domains.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a

Motivation: Address the problem of unprofessional or flippant remarks in financial advisory chatbots due to large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs, and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets that has limited previous research to isolated components.

Method: Developed Fin-Vault dataset (1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues) and Fin-Ally unified model that integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness, and conversational dynamics using COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: Comprehensive results show that incorporating commonsense context enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and professionally grounded financial guidance, extending beyond basic account management to personalized budgeting, expense tracking, and financial planning.

Conclusion: The approach positions Fin-Solution 2.O as a next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector, addressing the research gap through a unified framework that combines dataset creation and model optimization for professional financial advisory.

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous

the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,

Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMCS is an adaptive Monte Carlo search framework that improves process data generation for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) by dynamically allocating samples to uncertain reasoning steps and using adaptive exploration-exploitation policies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for process data generation use fixed-budget sampling and inefficient search strategies, making them inflexible and inefficient for training high-quality PRMs that enhance mathematical reasoning in large language models.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS) with two key components: (1) adaptive node value estimation that allocates more samples to uncertain reasoning steps, and (2) temporally adaptive path expansion policy that starts with broad exploration and gradually shifts to exploiting promising directions.

Result: Created MathSearch-200K dataset with 200K process supervision examples. Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieved 76.2% accuracy on MATH500, outperforming all baseline PRMs. A 7B model supervised by AMCS surpassed a 72B model with weaker supervision, and showed strong generalization on out-of-distribution problems.

Conclusion: AMCS provides an effective framework for adaptive process data generation that significantly improves PRM training and mathematical reasoning capabilities, demonstrating superior performance and generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: PRISM is a novel framework that decouples mathematical reasoning into strategy planning and targeted execution, using adaptive routing to dynamically select reasoning strategies based on problem-specific requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed strategies for mathematical reasoning, which cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements and overlook the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: Propose PRISM framework with two stages: strategy planning using a trained Strategy Adapter on MathStrat dataset, and targeted execution with adaptive routing that selects single-strategy, dual-strategy verification, or multi-strategy exploration based on confidence levels.

Result: PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble baselines across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different base models.

Conclusion: The adaptive routing approach shows strong benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures, effectively balancing effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code

TL;DR: The paper proposes Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO) to align reasoning safety in Large Reasoning Models by addressing harmful content in chain-of-thought reasoning through safety triggers and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook safe reasoning alignment, allowing harmful content in chain-of-thought reasoning to persist even when final responses appear safe, posing trustworthiness and security risks.

Method: IPO enforces safe reasoning by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing preference learning pairs with strong signals, based on insights about critical safety steps, compliance cues, and corrective interventions.

Result: IPO reduces harmfulness by over 30% compared to SFT-based and RL-based baselines on jailbreak and adversarial safety benchmarks while maintaining strong performance on diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of explicit reasoning alignment and provides a practical approach for safer Large Reasoning Models through process supervision and safety trigger interventions.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous

*Haotian Zhang,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Likang Xiao,Yanwei Ren,Quan Chen,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Process reward models (PRMs) improve LLM reasoning but struggle with generalization beyond mathematics. This paper proposes shifting from domain-specific knowledge verification to modeling domain-agnostic logical flow through contextual coherence in chain-of-thought steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PRMs show strong performance in mathematical domains but have limited generalization to other domains due to scarcity of domain-specific training data and knowledge-based learning patterns.

Method: Proposed a novel data annotation and training framework that focuses on modeling domain-agnostic logical flow by centering on contextual coherence between chain-of-thought steps, resulting in the ContextPRM model.

Result: ContextPRM achieves 6.5% average accuracy improvement over majority voting baseline across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro (law, history, philosophy), significantly outperforming VersaPRM (2.2% improvement) and other math-focused PRMs (0.5% gains).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates consistent performance across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains by focusing on logical flow rather than domain-specific knowledge, enhancing generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

*Vasileios Balafas,Dimos Tsouros,Nikolaos Ploskas,Kostas Stergiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid constraint acquisition framework that combines passive learning with interactive refinement to prevent over-fitting while maintaining manageable query complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of passive CA methods (over-fitting with spurious constraints) and purely active methods (high query intensity), especially in data-limited scenarios.

Method: Hybrid approach: passive learning for initial candidates, query-driven interactive refinement with probabilistic confidence scores, subset exploration to recover valid substructures, and final active learning for completeness.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework achieves high target model coverage and accuracy from limited examples with manageable query complexity.

Conclusion: The framework represents substantial advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic

integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and

TL;DR: EvoPH is a novel framework that co-evolves prompts and heuristic algorithms using LLMs, integrating island migration and elites selection to avoid local optima in automatic algorithm design for combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic algorithms require extensive domain expertise and implementation effort, while existing LLM-based approaches risk stagnation in local optima during automatic heuristics design.

Method: Proposes EvoPH framework that integrates island migration model with elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations, co-evolving prompts and heuristic algorithms guided by performance feedback.

Result: EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions on Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem datasets.

Conclusion: EvoPH advances the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs by effectively preventing local optima stagnation and improving solution quality in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous world models failed to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments, limiting their practical applications. The work aims to develop intelligent agents that can learn from imagination rather than direct environment interaction, which is crucial for domains like robotics where real-world interaction is unsafe or slow.

Method: Uses a world model with shortcut forcing objective and efficient transformer architecture for real-time interactive inference on a single GPU.

Result: Dreamer 4's world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics in Minecraft, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. It achieves the first successful diamond collection in Minecraft from purely offline data, requiring sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable recipe for imagination training and marks a significant step towards developing intelligent agents that can learn complex behaviors without direct environment interaction, with practical applications in domains like robotics.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast

accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-agent teaching architecture where humans can teach AI agents subjective tasks through demonstrations, using ingredient substitution as a case study. The method enables efficient learning from few examples by leveraging domain knowledge and strategic example selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate human ability to quickly learn new concepts from few examples, especially for subjective tasks with scarce data, through intuitive human-agent interaction.

Method: Human-agent teaching architecture with incremental learning from single examples, leveraging domain knowledge, efficient learning methods, and strategic example selection to minimize redundancy and maximize representativeness.

Result: The agent achieves half its task performance with only 100 examples compared to the full 50k training set, demonstrating efficient generalization through strategic example ordering and external symbolic knowledge.

Conclusion: Strategic example selection combined with learning methods that leverage external knowledge enables AI agents to learn subjective tasks efficiently from limited human demonstrations.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Anil Yaman,Frank van Harmelen,Erman Acar,Annette ten Teije*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether successful coordination through communication necessarily implies mutual understanding, finding that agents can develop 'successful misunderstandings' where they coordinate effectively despite having different interpretations of signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that successful coordination through communication always indicates mutual understanding, particularly in populations with different perceptual systems like hybrid human-AI groups.

Method: Using a signaling game where agents develop new vocabulary without observing each other's signal usage, only receiving rewards from interactions.

Result: Populations converge to optimal coordination but sometimes develop misaligned interpretations (successful misunderstandings). Shared interpretations only emerge with at least 3 agents that all interact with each other.

Conclusion: Successful coordination doesn't guarantee shared understanding. Minimum conditions for shared interpretations are at least 3 agents with full interaction connectivity, which enables compensation for lack of shared signal usage observations.

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs can detect their capability boundaries through reasoning confidence patterns and hidden states, enabling optimization strategies that avoid unproductive reasoning while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LRMs waste computation on unsolvable problems by reasoning unproductively until context limits, highlighting the need for self-awareness of capability boundaries.

Method: Two monitoring approaches: reasoning expression monitoring (confidence trajectory analysis) for black-box models, and hidden states monitoring (linear separability analysis) for white-box models.

Result: Boundary-aware strategies reduce token usage by 62.7-93.6% while maintaining accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency.

Conclusion: LRMs possess inherent capability boundary awareness that can be leveraged to optimize reasoning processes and prevent computational waste.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

TL;DR: LogicAgent is a semiotic-square-guided framework that addresses both logical and semantic complexity in LLM reasoning through multi-perspective FOL deduction and existential import checks with three-valued logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, struggling with abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances that are central to human reasoning.

Method: LogicAgent performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic while using existential import checks with a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases and mitigate vacuous reasoning.

Result: LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA (6.25% average gain over baselines) and generalizes to other benchmarks (7.05% additional average gain on ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA).

Conclusion: The semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning approach effectively boosts LLMs' logical performance, demonstrating strong effectiveness in handling complex logical and semantic challenges.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Motivation: Existing multimodal time series datasets lack genuine reasoning tasks and high-quality data, limiting progress in practical time series reasoning models.

Method: Created TSR-Suite with 23K samples (2.3K human-curated) and developed TimeOmni-1 model with multi-stage training, novel reward functions, and task scenario integration.

Result: TimeOmni-1 shows strong out-of-distribution generalization, improves causality discovery accuracy from 35.9% to 64.0% vs GPT-4.1, and increases valid response rate by over 6% for event-aware forecasting.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite enables comprehensive time series reasoning evaluation and training, with TimeOmni-1 demonstrating significant improvements over existing models in reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

### [113] [Query Circuits: Explaining How Language Models Answer User Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24808)
*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Query circuits are introduced as a method to trace information flow in language models for specific input-output mappings, providing more faithful explanations than surrogate-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only uncover global capability circuits but fail to explain why models produce specific outputs for particular inputs, creating a need for input-level explanations.

Method: Developed query circuits that directly trace information flow within models, introduced Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF) metric for evaluation, and used sampling-based methods to identify sparse circuits.

Result: Found extremely sparse query circuits covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of performance on MMLU questions, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Query circuits provide a step towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process individual inputs, offering more computationally accessible explanations than surrogate methods.

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

*Zhen Bi,Zhenlin Hu,Jinnan Yang,Mingyang Chen,Cheng Deng,Yida Xue,Zeyu Yang,Qing Shen,Zhenfang Liu,Kang Zhao,Ningyu Zhang,Jungang Lou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) to measure logical reasoning complexity in training data, and proposes a re-cognizing optimization strategy to enhance LLM reasoning performance by focusing on reasoning complexity rather than data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches focus on data format transformation but neglect internal reasoning complexity, leaving reasoning potential underutilized. The authors argue that LLM reasoning performance is constrained by both training data potential and model cognitive capacity.

Method: Introduces Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI) metric to quantify logical reasoning complexity by decomposing and aggregating logical structures. Proposes a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances logical reasoning intensity of training data to align with LLM's reasoning boundary.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance and generalization improvements over data-centric strategies. Method also validated under reinforcement learning framework.

Conclusion: Prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions is a coevolutionary multi-agent system that achieves breakthrough performance on Physics Olympiad problems by using three synergistic studios for visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and dual-stage verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics Olympiads represent the pinnacle of competitive physics problem-solving but remain underexplored in AI research, with existing approaches being single-model based and unable to reach gold-medal-level performance.

Method: A three-studio architecture: Visual Studio for diagram interpretation, Logic Studio for solution formulation, and Review Studio for dual-stage verification, with coevolution through iterative refinement loops where feedback guides self-correction.

Result: Achieves strong generalization across models, elevates open-source models from 1-2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, achieves first-ever open-source gold medal in IPhO, and reaches 26.8/30 points ranking 4th of 406 contestants.

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions provides a generalizable framework for Olympiad-level problem solving that can potentially extend across disciplines, demonstrating significant advancement in AI physics reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

*Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational taxonomy of the social science of large language models (LLMs) through systematic review of 270 studies, identifying three main domains: LLM as Social Minds, LLM Societies, and LLM-Human Interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented nature of research on LLMs in social science by creating a systematic taxonomy that organizes the field and clarifies evidentiary standards across different levels of analysis.

Method: Conducted systematic review of 270 studies using text embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and topic modeling to build a computational taxonomy.

Result: Identified three organic domains: 1) LLM as Social Minds (cognition, morality, bias attributions), 2) LLM Societies (multi-agent coordination and institutions), and 3) LLM-Human Interactions (task transformation, trust, work, governance).

Conclusion: The taxonomy provides a reproducible map of the fragmented field, clarifies evidentiary standards, and highlights opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RealUnify is a benchmark for evaluating bidirectional capability synergy between visual understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, revealing current models struggle with effective integration despite architectural unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks only assess understanding and generation capabilities in isolation, failing to determine if unified models can leverage synergies between these capabilities for mutual enhancement.

Method: Created RealUnify benchmark with 1,000 human-annotated instances across 10 categories and 32 subtasks, structured around two axes: understanding enhances generation and generation enhances understanding, with dual-evaluation protocol combining end-to-end and diagnostic stepwise assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines shows current unified models struggle to achieve effective synergy between understanding and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: Architectural unification alone is insufficient for achieving capability synergy; new training strategies and inductive biases are needed to fully unlock the potential of unified multimodal modeling.

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

*Max Pellert,Clemens M. Lechner,Indira Sen,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQuID enables neural embeddings to recover latent dimensions from survey items, achieving 55% variance explained in dimension similarities compared to human data without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective, scalable method that can replicate psychometric structures traditionally obtained through extensive human surveys, addressing the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions.

Method: Uses SQuID (Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings Differentials) to process large language model embeddings, comparing multiple embedding models across various evaluation metrics to recover the structure of human values from the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire.

Result: Explains 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data, shows fair factor congruence coefficients in multidimensional scaling, and successfully recovers negative correlations between dimensions without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric structures with comparable quality to traditional methods, offering substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility for psychometrics and social science research.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

TL;DR: A Bayesian meta-learning framework that converts normative theories into probabilistic models using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, improving data fitting and theory validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty in arbitrating between competing normative theories and using them as inductive biases for data-driven fits of biological systems.

Method: Meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data from normative theories using adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, creating Theory-Informed Kernels for probabilistic modeling.

Result: Improved response prediction accuracy in mouse retinal ganglion cell recordings, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, interpretable representations, and accurate theory-match inference through Bayesian model selection.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry, particularly in neuroscience.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MASLegalBench is a legal benchmark designed for multi-agent systems using GDPR scenarios to evaluate LLM-based agents' capabilities in legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal benchmarks don't leverage MAS advantages like task decomposition and agent specialization, limiting MAS potential in legal domain.

Method: Proposed MASLegalBench with GDPR scenarios, manually designed role-based MAS architectures, and extensive experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Results reveal strengths, limitations, and improvement areas for existing models and MAS architectures in legal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench enables better evaluation of multi-agent systems in legal domain and identifies opportunities for enhancing LLM-based legal reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

TL;DR: This paper conducts an empirical study on V2X cooperative perception systems, identifying six prevalent error patterns and evaluating critical system components through large-scale analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V2X cooperative perception systems face operational challenges due to their complex composition with diverse sensors, fusion schemes, and communication conditions. The types of errors and their underlying causes in these systems remain insufficiently explored.

Method: The researchers conducted an empirical study by systematically evaluating critical components of V2X cooperative perception systems through large-scale analysis. They identified and analyzed six prevalent error patterns in these systems.

Result: Key findings include: (1) LiDAR-based cooperation has highest perception performance; (2) V2I and V2V communication show distinct performance under different fusion schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors lead to more driving violations; (4) Systems are not robust against communication interference during online operation.

Conclusion: The study reveals potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of cooperative perception systems, providing insights to promote better design and repair of these systems.

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

TL;DR: SciExplorer is an AI agent that uses large language models to autonomously explore and discover physical laws from unknown systems through experiments and analysis, without requiring domain-specific knowledge or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fully automate the scientific discovery process by creating an agent that can explore unknown systems and discover their underlying laws through free-form experimentation, without task-specific tailoring.

Method: Uses large language model tool-use capabilities with minimal tools (primarily code execution) to enable free-form exploration of physical systems, testing on mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics.

Result: Impressive performance in recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values across diverse physical systems.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective scientific exploration without fine-tuning or task-specific instructions, opening doors for similar applications in other domains.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

TL;DR: CLPO introduces a curriculum-guided learning approach for RLVR that dynamically adjusts training difficulty based on the model's current capabilities, improving learning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods treat all training samples uniformly, ignoring differences in problem difficulty relative to model capabilities, leading to inefficient exploration and limited performance.

Method: CLPO creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop using real-time difficulty assessment from model rollouts to construct an Online Curriculum, which guides Adaptive Problem Restructuring where the model diversifies medium problems and simplifies challenging ones.

Result: CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks with average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods.

Conclusion: CLPO transforms static training into a dynamic co-evolution process with model capabilities, demonstrating potential for more efficient training of reasoning models.

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

TL;DR: AutoPlay is a scalable pipeline for generating diverse, executable tasks for training multimodal large language models as interactive agents, reducing reliance on human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality downstream agentic task datasets that are diverse, feasible, and verifiable poses a key challenge in scaling post-training of MLLMs for interactive agents.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) exploration phase where MLLM agent systematically uncovers environment states and functionalities, (2) task generation phase using exploration trajectories and task guideline prompts to synthesize executable tasks.

Result: Generated 20k tasks across 20 Android apps and 10k tasks across 13 Ubuntu apps, enabling training that improved success rates by up to 20.0% on mobile-use and 10.9% on computer-use scenarios, with additional 5.7% gain from reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: AutoPlay establishes a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents that significantly reduces reliance on human annotation while improving agent performance across mobile and computer use cases.

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on

*Sai Wang,Yu Wu,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CEL is a novel agent architecture that uses LLMs to learn game rules and strategies through explicit reasoning and planning, achieving mastery in grid-world games from sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more interpretable and general AI agents that learn through explicit reasoning rather than opaque neural network weights, enabling transparent world modeling.

Method: CEL uses a cycle of interaction and reflection: after each episode, it performs Rule Induction to learn environment dynamics and Strategy Summarization to create actionable playbooks from trajectory analysis.

Result: CEL successfully mastered diverse grid-world games (Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, Sokoban) by autonomously discovering rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that build transparent world models through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enables LLMs to acquire genuinely new compositional skills by combining existing ones, not just activating existing capabilities. This compositional learning transfers to new tasks and fundamentally changes reasoning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate about whether RL teaches LLMs genuinely new skills or merely activates existing ones, and to understand if LLMs can acquire compositional skills like humans do.

Method: Developed a synthetic framework using string transformation functions, where skills are defined as inferring f(x) given x. Tested RL's ability to teach compositions h(x)=g(f(x)) when models already know f and g individually.

Result: RL enables LLMs to learn unseen compositions of functions, generalizes to compositions of >2 functions, and transfers compositional skills to different tasks without target-specific training. RL fundamentally changes reasoning behaviors, unlike next-token training.

Conclusion: RL can teach LLMs genuinely new compositional skills, suggesting a strategy of building base models with basic skills first, then using RL to develop advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLHI learns from natural human conversations for model alignment, using user-guided rewrites and persona-based rewards to outperform baselines in personalization and instruction-following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational models rely on pre-annotated expert feedback, but future models need to learn from natural human interaction for continual improvement and multifaceted alignment.

Method: Two methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites - revises model outputs based on users' natural-language follow-up responses; (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards - learns via reward model conditioned on user's long-term interaction history (persona). Uses persona-conditioned preference optimization.

Result: Both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following. Similar feedback also enhances performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Organic human interaction offers scalable, effective supervision for personalized alignment, suggesting natural conversations can provide valuable learning signals for model improvement.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

*Yue Zhang,Tianyi Ma,Zun Wang,Yanyuan Qiao,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-perspective textual description approach for LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation agents to improve contextual understanding through analogical reasoning across images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot LLM-based VLN agents either oversimplify visual details by encoding images as textual scene descriptions or fail to capture abstract semantics when processing raw image inputs, limiting their navigation performance.

Method: Incorporates textual descriptions from multiple perspectives to facilitate analogical reasoning across images, enhancing global scene understanding and spatial reasoning for more accurate action decisions.

Result: Experiments on the R2R dataset demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-perspective textual description approach with analogical reasoning effectively enhances LLM-based VLN agents' contextual understanding and navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReasoningBank is a memory framework that enables LLM agents to learn from past experiences by distilling reasoning strategies from successful and failed interactions, improving performance over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents fail to learn from accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors instead of becoming more capable over time.

Method: Proposes ReasoningBank framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from self-judged experiences, with memory retrieval and integration. Also introduces memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS) to accelerate learning by scaling up interaction experience.

Result: Outperforms existing memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, improving both effectiveness and efficiency. MaTTS further amplifies these gains.

Conclusion: Establishes memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arising.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

*Nicholas Budny,Kia Ghods,Declan Campbell,Raja Marjieh,Amogh Joshi,Sreejan Kumar,Jonathan D. Cohen,Taylor W. Webb,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with simple visual reasoning tasks due to deficits in visually-grounded serial processing, unlike humans who excel at such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why VLMs fail on simple visual reasoning tasks despite success on standard benchmarks, and test if visually-grounded serial processing deficits are the cause.

Method: Compared human and VLM performance across geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation tasks with varying serial processing demands.

Result: Decreased VLM accuracy strongly correlated with increased human reaction time across all domains, showing VLM-human performance gap widens with serial processing demands.

Conclusion: Limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a fundamental bottleneck distinguishing current VLMs from humans.

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

### [132] [UniAPL: A Unified Adversarial Preference Learning Framework for Instruct-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25148)
*FaQiang Qian,WeiKun Zhang,Ziliang Wang,Kang An,Xuhui Zheng,Liangjian Wen,Mengya Gao,Yong Dai,Yichao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniAPL is a unified preference learning framework that jointly trains on SFT and preference data in a single stage, solving distributional mismatch between static expert data and evolving policy distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sequential alignment pipeline (SFT followed by RL) suffers from distributional mismatch where SFT uses static expert data but policy distribution drifts during RL, making SFT knowledge brittle and RL updates inefficient.

Method: Reframe alignment as constrained optimization and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL) with single-stage unified training objective using mixed batches of SFT and preference data, allowing expert demonstrations to directly ground online exploration.

Result: UniAPL matches or exceeds strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B, even outperforming the teacher model. Response analysis shows outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations.

Conclusion: UniAPL achieves both stronger performance and better behavioral alignment by resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy between demonstration and preference learning.

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces judgment detection - identifying LLM-generated judgments using only scores and candidate content, proposes J-Detector with linguistic and LLM-enhanced features, and demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting biased LLM judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judgments are increasingly used but suffer from inherent biases and vulnerabilities, creating urgent need for detection methods in sensitive applications like academic peer reviewing where distinguishing human vs LLM judgments is crucial.

Method: Proposed J-Detector - a lightweight neural detector that extracts explicit linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to capture interactions between judgment scores and candidate content, addressing limitations of existing text detection methods.

Result: Experiments show J-Detector effectively detects LLM-generated judgments across diverse datasets, outperforms existing methods, enables bias quantification in LLM judges, and validates practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-generated judgments are detectable using specialized methods like J-Detector that capture score-content interactions, providing valuable tools for ensuring judgment integrity in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

TL;DR: Localized adversarial attacks using binary masks achieve better imperceptibility than global attacks but require more computation and slightly lower success rates, with iterative methods performing better than single-step ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of localized adversarial noise compared to traditional global perturbations, and systematically evaluate their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency.

Method: Systematically evaluated localized adversarial attacks using FGSM, PGD, and C&W methods with binary masks to constrain noise to specific regions, comparing them against global attacks.

Result: Localized attacks achieved significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher PSNR, and improved SSIM compared to global attacks, but with increased computational effort and modest reduction in Attack Success Rate. Iterative methods (PGD, C&W) were more robust than single-step methods (FGSM).

Conclusion: Localized adversarial attacks offer improved imperceptibility but require trade-offs in computational efficiency and attack success, with iterative methods being more effective under localization constraints.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces In-Context Continual Learning (ICCL), which enables large language models to achieve continual learning through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement without parameter updates, showing human-like retention patterns and addressing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether in-context learning can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation in sequential multitask settings, inspired by human memory studies.

Method: Extends in-context learning to ICCL through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement, using Markov-Chain benchmarks and proposing a human-retention similarity metric to quantify alignment with human retention dynamics.

Result: ICCL benefits from distributed practice similar to humans, reveals spacing "sweet spots" for retention, and linear-attention models like MAMBA and RWKV show particularly human-like retention patterns despite lower performance than Transformers.

Conclusion: ICCL is established as both cognitively plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only continual learning paradigm that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Motivation: To address challenges in collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures while ensuring interoperability and privacy.

Method: Use a common fusion-layer output dimension to partition models into personalized base blocks and generalized modular blocks, sharing only fusion-layer outputs while keeping model parameters private.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables collaborative learning across heterogeneous architectures with improved communication efficiency and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports

facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output

outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relational Graph Recognition (RGR) to formally analyze self-attention capacity, showing that total key dimension $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both necessary and sufficient to recover $m'$ relations, providing a capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally understand the capacity of self-attention mechanisms - specifically how many distinct relations a single layer can reliably recover for a given computational budget, addressing the lack of formal understanding about attention's relational learning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Relational Graph Recognition (RGR) framework where key-query channels represent graphs, analytically derives capacity scaling laws, and validates empirically through controlled single-layer experiments that measure the number of recoverable relations.

Result: Established that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both information-theoretically necessary and sufficient for recovering $m'$ relations in broad graph classes. Shows multi-head attention mitigates interference when embeddings are compressed ($m > d_{\text{model}}$), with experiments revealing sharp performance thresholds matching predicted capacity scaling.

Conclusion: Provides concrete scaling laws for self-attention capacity and principled design rules for allocating key-query budget across heads, showing that distributing $D_K$ across multiple small heads increases recoverable relations by mitigating interference in compressed embedding scenarios.

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

*Yaswanth Chittepu,Prasann Singhal,Greg Durrett,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DPO-PoP, an extension to Direct Preference Optimization that uses preference-over-preference annotations to infer adaptive margins per datapoint, improving both discriminative and generative performance over fixed-margin approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing margin-based optimization methods in RLHF use fixed or simplistic margins that don't account for varying preference strengths, and many assume access to accurate preference scores which are difficult for humans to provide reliably.

Method: Leverages preferences over preferences (ordinal signals indicating which of two preferences reflects stronger distinction) to infer adaptive margins. Extends DPO with these adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis.

Result: Outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on UltraFeedback dataset. Shows tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance, proposing two sampling strategies to balance this tradeoff.

Conclusion: Modeling preference strength through adaptive margins improves alignment and generalization. The proposed DPO-PoP method effectively leverages preference-over-preference supervision to achieve better performance while navigating the discriminative-generative tradeoff.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

### [140] [FedAgentBench: Towards Automating Real-world Federated Medical Image Analysis with Server-Client LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23803)
*Pramit Saha,Joshua Strong,Divyanshu Mishra,Cheng Ouyang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an agent-driven federated learning framework and benchmark (FedAgentBench) to automate healthcare FL workflows, addressing practical orchestration challenges like client selection, coordination, and data harmonization that hinder real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world FL deployment in healthcare faces complex operational challenges requiring substantial human effort, including client selection, coordination, data pre-processing, harmonizing non-standardized data, and algorithm selection. Existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges.

Method: Proposed an agent-driven FL framework capturing key phases of real-world FL workflows and FedAgentBench benchmark. Framework incorporates 40 FL algorithms tailored to diverse requirements and cross-client characteristics, with tasks across 201 datasets simulating 6 healthcare environments.

Result: Evaluated 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs. While some agent cores like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 can automate various FL pipeline stages, complex interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging even for the strongest models.

Conclusion: Agent-driven FL systems show promise for automating healthcare FL workflows but face limitations in handling complex, interdependent tasks with implicit goals, highlighting the need for continued development in autonomous FL coordination.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

*Sameep Chattopadhyay,Nikhil Karamchandani,Sharayu Mohair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for coordinated adversarial attacks on online learning to rank algorithms, showing that only O(log T) manipulations are needed to promote target items and cause linear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning to rank algorithms are widely used in search engines and recommender systems, but their vulnerability to coordinated adversarial attacks is poorly understood.

Method: Proposed two attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB, designed to promote target items in top-K recommendations while inducing linear regret.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed, with empirical validation on real-world data.

Conclusion: OLTR algorithms are vulnerable to efficient coordinated attacks that can manipulate rankings with minimal interventions while significantly degrading performance.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPS-MTM is a foundation model for mobility data that decomposes trajectories into states (POI categories) and actions (transitions), using a bi-directional Transformer with masked modeling to learn semantic patterns without manual labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures normal human movement patterns, similar to breakthroughs in text, vision, and video understanding.

Method: Decomposes mobility into states and actions modalities, uses bi-directional Transformer with self-supervised masked modeling objective to reconstruct missing segments across modalities.

Result: Consistently outperforms on trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction across benchmark datasets, with strongest advantages in dynamic tasks requiring contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: GPS-MTM establishes itself as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

### [143] [Neighborhood Sampling Does Not Learn the Same Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22868)
*Zehao Niu,Mihai Anitescu,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of neighborhood sampling in graph neural networks using neural tangent kernels, showing different sampling approaches produce different posterior distributions with limited samples but converge to the same distribution as sample size increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neighborhood sampling is crucial for training large-scale graph neural networks to control memory and computational costs, but its systemic behaviors are not well understood despite being standard practice.

Method: Used neural tangent kernels to analyze training dynamics through infinitely wide counterparts (Gaussian processes), studying various established neighborhood sampling approaches and their corresponding posterior GPs.

Result: With limited samples, different sampling approaches produce different posterior distributions, though they converge to the same distribution as sample size increases. Posterior covariances are incomparable, explaining why no single sampling approach dominates.

Conclusion: Neighborhood sampling approaches have distinct behaviors with limited samples but converge asymptotically, and no single method is universally superior, which aligns with empirical observations in practice.

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods for hydropower plants, benchmarking LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM on real-world datasets from an Austrian pumped-storage plant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unplanned outages in industrial factories and energy producers are highly costly, but existing acoustic-anomaly detection studies rely on generic datasets with limited focus on hydropower plants due to access constraints.

Method: Address acoustic preprocessing challenges under noisy conditions, extract time- and frequency-domain features, and benchmark three ML models (LSTM AE, K-Means, OC-SVM) on two real-world datasets from a pumped-storage plant with induced and real-world anomalies.

Result: One-Class SVM achieved best trade-off with ROC AUC 0.966-0.998 and minimal training time, while LSTM autoencoder delivered strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at higher computational cost.

Conclusion: Acoustic-based anomaly detection methods show promise for predictive maintenance in hydropower plants, with OC-SVM providing optimal balance of performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

*Anutam Srinivasan,Aditya T. Vadlamani,Amin Meghrazi,Srinivasan Parthasarathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends Conformal Fairness to Federated Learning to audit model fairness across demographic groups while maintaining probabilistic guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Conformal Prediction provides uncertainty quantification but doesn't address fairness across sensitive attributes. Existing fairness methods need adaptation for Federated Learning settings.

Method: Extends Conformal Fairness framework to Federated Learning, analyzing fairness gaps across demographic groups while leveraging exchangeability assumption.

Result: Empirically validated on multiple datasets across domains, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in auditing federated models for fairness.

Conclusion: Successfully adapts Conformal Fairness to Federated Learning, enabling fairness auditing while maintaining probabilistic coverage guarantees.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

TL;DR: A geometry-regularized twin autoencoder framework for manifold alignment that enables out-of-sample extension and improves cross-domain generalization through structured cross-modal mappings and multitask learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manifold alignment methods lack out-of-sample extension capability, limiting their real-world applicability for integrating multi-modal data across domains.

Method: Uses a twin autoencoder architecture with geometry regularization, pre-trained alignment model, and multitask learning to enforce structured cross-modal mappings and maintain geometric fidelity in embeddings.

Result: Shows improvements in embedding consistency, information preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Applied to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, it enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging multi-modal patient data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the out-of-sample extension limitation of traditional MA methods while improving generalization and robustness in cross-domain applications.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

*Matthieu Zimmer,Xiaotong Ji,Tu Nguyen,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel constrained reinforcement learning approach for LLM distillation that maximizes task rewards while constraining divergence from teacher models, achieving better constraint satisfaction and reasoning than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM distillation methods use ad-hoc reward weighting; need principled optimization framework for reward-aware distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Formulates distillation as constrained RL problem with modified reward function that ensures constraint satisfaction without state augmentation, teacher access during deployment, or Lagrangian computational overhead.

Result: Achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and reasoning on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while maintaining competitive task performance.

Conclusion: Provides theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MonoCon introduces functional constraints via a monotonic MLP head to learn robust, compact, and disentangled representations with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations in AI beyond architectural and optimization constraints.

Method: Attach a small monotonic MLP head to any pre-trained encoder and train with contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints to induce co-adaptation between encoder and head.

Result: On CIFAR-100: 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust embeddings while retaining 99% of baseline accuracy. On SNLI: 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust with marginal STSb score reduction.

Conclusion: MonoCon provides a general domain-agnostic framework that offers unified solutions for edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval through functionally constrained robust and ultra-compact representations.

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

*Aleksandr Dremov,David Grangier,Angelos Katharopoulos,Awni Hannun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates optimal compute allocation between full-precision (FP) and quantization-aware training (QAT) phases, finding that the optimal QAT-to-FP ratio increases with total compute budget and can be predicted using tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed that decomposing training into FP followed by QAT phases improves accuracy over QAT alone, but the optimal compute allocation between these phases remained unclear, limiting efficient QAT planning.

Method: Conducted extensive experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths (2-8 bits), and model sizes (86.0M to 2.2B parameters). Derived a loss scaling law from experimental data and proposed a novel cooldown and QAT fusion approach that combines learning rate decay with quantization-aware training.

Result: Found that loss-optimal QAT-to-FP ratio increases with total compute budget, contrary to previous findings. The optimal fraction can be accurately predicted using tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. The scaling law successfully predicts optimal QAT ratios and final performance across different compute allocations and bit widths.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for efficient QAT planning and enable training higher-quality quantized models with the same compute budget. The proposed cooldown and QAT fusion approach eliminates redundant FP updates and achieves significant compute savings.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

TL;DR: SOAP shows similar convergence to Shampoo and no significant advantage over Adam or Shampoo in final loss, aligning with theoretical equivalence between idealized SOAP and Shampoo under Kronecker product assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as approximations to the whitening matrix that captures second-order curvature information.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing equivalence between idealized SOAP and Shampoo under Kronecker product assumption, plus empirical evaluation using nanoGPT for language modeling and grayscale image colorization experiments.

Result: SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved.

Conclusion: The empirical results align with the theoretical equivalence between SOAP and Shampoo, showing SOAP doesn't provide significant practical advantages over existing methods despite its promising initial appearance.

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

*Lorenz K. Müller,Philippe Bich,Jiawei Zhuang,Ahmet Çelik,Luca Benfenati,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINQ introduces a second-axis scale factor and Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to normalize per-row and per-column variances, improving post-training quantization for LLMs at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training quantization methods show perplexity degradation at ≤4-bit widths due to precision issues from outlier representations, especially in calibration-free uniform quantization.

Method: Augments existing quantizers with second-axis scale factor and fast Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to normalize per-row/column variances, minimizing matrix imbalance as quantization proxy target.

Result: Significantly improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity against uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines on Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V2.5 models, with further enhancement when combined with calibration and non-uniform quantization.

Conclusion: SINQ provides layer-independent quantization that can be trivially applied to new architectures for any linear layers, offering improved performance at low bit-widths.

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

TL;DR: A meta-learning framework using Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator for data assimilation problems, reducing computational cost and improving efficiency compared to standard conjugate gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational data assimilation methods are computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Proposed FNO-CG approach that uses Fourier Neural Operator to approximate the inverse Hessian operator across DA problems and provides initialization for conjugate gradient method.

Result: Numerical experiments on linear advection equation show 62% reduction in average relative error and 17% reduction in number of iterations compared to standard CG, with best improvements in ill-conditioned scenarios.

Conclusion: FNO-CG demonstrates robustness and efficiency for challenging data assimilation problems, particularly in ill-conditioned cases.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

TL;DR: Proposed GDR-learners are generative Neyman-orthogonal methods for estimating potential outcomes distributions with quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep generative models for potential outcomes estimation lack Neyman-orthogonality, quasi-oracle efficiency, and double robustness properties.

Method: Developed GDR-learners using four approaches: conditional normalizing flows (GDR-CNFs), conditional GANs (GDR-CGANs), conditional VAEs (GDR-CVAEs), and conditional diffusion models (GDR-CDMs).

Result: GDR-learners demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in estimating conditional distributions of potential outcomes in semi-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: GDR-learners provide asymptotically optimal estimation with theoretical guarantees of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness.

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A doubly-robust estimation framework that combines LLM-generated persona ratings with biased human ratings to obtain valid system quality estimates for Generative AI evaluations, addressing evaluation sampling bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the external validity problem in Generative AI evaluations where lab-based ratings don't generalize to real-world deployment due to sampling bias in human rater selection and system outputs.

Method: Proposes a doubly-robust estimation framework using LLM-generated persona ratings (simulating human raters with specific sociodemographic characteristics) combined with biased human ratings. Validates through theoretical analysis and Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) that manipulates persona quality and sampling bias.

Result: The framework produces statistically valid system quality estimates when either the prediction model for human ratings or the reweighting model for sampling bias correction is sufficiently accurate.

Conclusion: Provides a principled approach to combine imperfect persona ratings with biased human ratings, enabling valid system quality estimation despite evaluation sampling bias in Generative AI assessments.

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using discrete diffusion models as policies for reinforcement learning in large combinatorial action spaces, achieving state-of-the-art results through stable online training and policy mirror descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning struggles with large combinatorial action spaces common in real-world problems, requiring more effective and scalable policy representations.

Method: Uses discrete diffusion models as policies with an efficient online training process that leverages policy mirror descent to define regularized target policy distributions, framing policy updates as distributional matching problems.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample efficiency across diverse combinatorial benchmarks including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent systems, outperforming other baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion policy framework effectively addresses scalability challenges in RL for combinatorial action spaces through stable training and expressive policy representations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

### [156] [Functional Critic Modeling for Provably Convergent Off-Policy Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22964)
*Qinxun Bai,Yuxuan Han,Wei Xu,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel functional critic modeling approach for off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning, addressing challenges of the deadly triad instability and moving target problem while providing theoretical convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy actor-critic methods face two key challenges: (1) the deadly triad instability combined with moving target problem in critic learning, and (2) inefficient actor learning due to difficulty in estimating exact off-policy policy gradient, which often gets approximated to on-policy gradient in practice.

Method: Proposes functional critic modeling concept that leads to a new actor-critic framework. Provides theoretical analysis in linear function setting and designs a neural network architecture for practical implementation.

Result: Establishes provable convergence of the framework, making it the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. Preliminary experiments on DeepMind Control Benchmark demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The functional critic modeling approach successfully addresses both challenges in off-policy actor-critic learning, providing theoretical convergence guarantees and practical effectiveness in reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAEclust is a functional autoencoder framework for clustering multi-dimensional functional data, featuring universal-approximator encoder/decoder, regularization strategies, clustering loss integration, and phase-variation resistant shape-informed clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust framework for cluster analysis of multi-dimensional functional data that can handle complex nonlinear interdependencies and be resistant to phase variations in functions.

Method: Functional autoencoder with universal-approximator encoder and decoder, innovative regularization for functional weights/biases, clustering loss integration, and shape-informed clustering objective for phase variation resistance.

Result: The framework establishes universal approximation property and shows effectiveness through extensive experiments, demonstrating robust clustering performance on functional data.

Conclusion: FAEclust provides an effective solution for clustering multi-dimensional functional data with enhanced stability, robustness, and phase-variation resistance through its novel autoencoder architecture and regularization strategies.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic approach to improve LLM accuracy in translating natural language to mixed-integer linear programming formulations by integrating optimization expertise through data cleaning and multi-turn inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for mathematical programming formulation achieve limited accuracy due to scarce and noisy training data that doesn't leverage domain knowledge, despite the importance of automating this skill-intensive process.

Method: The approach cleans training data through class-based error analysis to prevent common mistakes, then uses multi-turn inference strategies with class-specific error summaries and solver feedback for iterative refinement of formulations.

Result: Experiments show that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average across multiple base LLMs.

Conclusion: The systematic integration of optimization expertise enables significant progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation for mixed-integer linear programming problems.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the modeling capabilities of multi-stage stochastic programs by incorporating features from MDPs, particularly addressing decision-dependent uncertainty and statistical learning in continuous state/action spaces.

Method: Extends policy graphs to include decision-dependent uncertainty for transition probabilities and statistical learning. Develops new variants of stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) with approximations to handle non-convexities.

Result: The approach demonstrates increased expressiveness through examples of increasing complexity, showing the framework can model sophisticated stochastic optimization problems with decision-dependent dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed modeling framework and SDDP variants successfully extend the capabilities of multi-stage stochastic programming to handle complex decision-dependent uncertainty and learning in continuous domains.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-stage stochastic programs, which incorporate
modeling features from Markov decision processes (MDPs). This class includes
structured MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. We extend policy
graphs to include decision-dependent uncertainty for one-step transition
probabilities as well as a limited form of statistical learning. We focus on
the expressiveness of our modeling approach, illustrating ideas with a series

*Yuanyuan Yang,Ruimin Zhang,Jamie Morgenstern,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-Tamer is a framework that formalizes multi-model serving as a multi-stage decision process, proving that recall (ability to revisit earlier models) is necessary and sufficient for achieving provable performance guarantees in accuracy-latency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current strategies for multi-model serving trade-offs are largely heuristic and case-specific, lacking theoretical guarantees and general applicability despite the importance of balancing accuracy, latency, and resource usage.

Method: Formalizes the setting as a multi-stage decision process to determine when to exit and which model to consult, with recall-based strategies that allow revisiting earlier models.

Result: Proves that strategies without recall cannot achieve constant-factor approximation to optimal trade-offs, while recall-based strategies provably attain optimal trade-offs in polynomial time. Experiments on synthetic datasets and vision/NLP benchmarks validate these findings.

Conclusion: Recall-based strategies provide a principled foundation for bridging heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in early-exit and cascaded model design, consistently yielding efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

### [161] [Analysis of Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22994)
*Zachary Baker,Yuxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether adding variational methods to Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) improves feature organization and interpretability, but finds that the variational SAE (vSAE) underperforms standard SAE across most metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if variational methods can enhance SAEs by improving feature organization and interpretability through probabilistic sampling that creates dispersive pressure in the latent space.

Method: Introduced variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE) that replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence regularization. Evaluated against standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer activations using SAE Bench, feature interpretability analysis, and t-SNE visualization.

Result: vSAE underperformed standard SAE across core metrics, though it excelled at feature independence and ablation metrics. The KL divergence caused excessive regularization, substantially reducing living features and leading to performance degradation. vSAE features showed improved robustness but many more dead features.

Conclusion: Naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability, as the KL divergence creates problematic regularization pressure that degrades performance.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

TL;DR: Proposes a new calibration error definition that interpolates between two established notions, with polynomial sample complexity for most of the range and improved error dependence at one endpoint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiclass predictor calibration is challenging due to exponential number of possible prediction values, requiring better calibration error definitions with efficient sample complexity.

Method: Novel application of adaptive data analysis with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in sample complexity, enabling calibration across interpolation range.

Result: Algorithm can calibrate any predictor for entire interpolation range (except one endpoint) using polynomial number of samples, achieving nearly optimal error dependence at other endpoint.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration error definition and algorithm provide efficient multiclass calibration with polynomial sample complexity and improved error bounds.

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPS-GAN is a novel neural network that captures dynamics of multiple systems and generalizes to unseen physical parameters without requiring prior knowledge of the system configuration space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network models based on classical mechanics typically capture only single systems with fixed parameters and require known configuration spaces. SPS-GAN aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone, with an additional physically motivated term to encourage sparse configuration space representation.

Result: SPS-GAN captures multiple systems and achieves performance comparable to supervised models designed for single systems, demonstrating utility for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery.

Conclusion: The approach successfully generalizes to unseen physical parameters and discovers configuration space structure from arbitrary measurement types without prior knowledge.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS enables dynamic sparsity control in Mixture of Experts models, allowing practitioners to adjust the sparsity level (k) at inference time without retraining or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models require training multiple models for different sparsity levels, complicating serving, increasing costs, and limiting flexibility for diverse latency and efficiency requirements.

Method: MoE-PHDS uses a lightweight supervised fine-tuning method with a curriculum approach that mixes training across sparsity levels and anchors with short training at high sparsity, requiring no architectural modifications.

Result: PHDS matches or exceeds oracle models across multiple operating points, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22%, and enables flexible runtime deployment by making global sparsity a serving primitive.

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS provides predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from a single model, allowing dynamic sparsity adjustment at inference time without checkpoint swapping or token-level heuristics.

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

### [165] [On the Sheafification of Higher-Order Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23020)
*Jacob Hume,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using sheaf theory to enhance higher-order message passing in topological deep learning, addressing limitations of the Hodge Laplacian by developing a more expressive sheaf Laplacian framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hodge Laplacian's inductive bias becomes opaque and potentially degenerate for higher dimensions (k>0) in topological deep learning, limiting expressive power for complex relational structures beyond graphs.

Method: The authors develop sheaf theory as a principled formalism to modify the Hodge Laplacian, creating a sheaf Laplacian that correlates data features with sheaf cohomology rather than singular cohomology.

Result: The paper extends prior theory on sheaf diffusion from graph learning (k=0) to higher-order settings (k>0), providing novel theoretical foundations and practical applications for more expressive message passing.

Conclusion: Sheaf theory offers a natural and powerful framework for enhancing topological deep learning by providing data-aware generalizations of cohomology that enable more expressive higher-order message passing across complex relational structures.

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies three geometric phases in LLM training: initial collapse, entropy-seeking expansion, and compression-seeking consolidation, driven by cross-entropy optimization and representational bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard training metrics fail to explain emergent capabilities in LLMs, so the authors investigate the geometry of learned representations to understand training dynamics.

Method: Spectral analysis using effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay (α-ReQ) on OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models across pretraining and post-training phases.

Result: Identified consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases: warmup (collapse), entropy-seeking (dimensional expansion), and compression-seeking (anisotropic consolidation). Post-training methods (SFT, DPO, RLVR) further transform geometry with different effects.

Conclusion: Training phases emerge from cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks, with post-training methods having distinct geometric impacts on model behavior.

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem and introduces a method with two-stage training to mitigate forgetting by identifying shared latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and model catastrophic interference (catastrophic forgetting) from a latent representation learning perspective, addressing the fundamental challenge where models lose performance on previous tasks when learning new ones.

Method: Proposes a two-stage training strategy: first uses maximum likelihood estimation to learn latent representations from partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups, then optimizes KL divergence to identify and learn shared latent variables.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that forgetting can be quantified by the distance between PTA and ATA setups, and empirical validations demonstrate that identifying shared latent variables effectively mitigates catastrophic interference.

Conclusion: The approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements for mitigating catastrophic interference across synthetic and benchmark datasets through identification of shared latent representations.

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

TL;DR: A novel federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy and adaptive model design to address data sensitivity and heterogeneity in 6G edge networks, achieving strong privacy protection while significantly improving model performance and reducing resource costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable pervasive AI in 6G networks through edge intelligence while addressing key challenges: parameter sharing risks data reconstruction attacks, and unified global models struggle with diverse local data distributions at edge devices.

Method: Proposes a federated learning framework using sample-level representations for knowledge sharing with personalized differential privacy to resist reconstruction attacks. Develops a privacy-aware neural architecture search algorithm that generates locally customized architectures and hyperparameters for distribution-aware adaptation under privacy constraints.

Result: Achieves strong privacy guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, improves accuracy by 6.82% over PerFedRLNAS, reduces model size to 1/10, and communication cost to 1/20. Provides theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: This is the first personalized differential privacy solution tailored for representation-based federated learning, successfully balancing privacy protection with model performance and efficiency in edge computing environments.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art

### [169] [GuardNet: Graph-Attention Filtering for Jailbreak Defense in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23037)
*Javad Forough,Mohammad Maheri,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GuardNet is a hierarchical filtering framework that uses graph neural networks to detect and filter jailbreak prompts in LLMs before inference, achieving significant improvements in detection accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety constraints, posing critical risks in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Current defenses are insufficient to protect against these adversarial prompts.

Method: Constructs structured graphs combining sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations, then applies graph neural networks at both prompt-level and token-level filtering to detect adversarial patterns.

Result: Substantially outperforms prior defenses, raising prompt-level F1 scores from 66.4% to 99.8% on LLM-Fuzzer and from 67-79% to over 94% on PLeak datasets. Token-level F1 improved from 48-75% to 74-91%, with IoU gains up to +28%.

Conclusion: GuardNet provides a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats with acceptable latency and good generalization, making it suitable for real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

### [170] [IsingFormer: Augmenting Parallel Tempering With Learned Proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23043)
*Saleh Bunaiyan,Corentin Delacour,Shuvro Chowdhury,Kyle Lee,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsingFormer uses a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples to generate uncorrelated spin configurations as global proposals in Parallel Tempering, accelerating MCMC sampling and combinatorial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCMC methods like Parallel Tempering mix slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes due to reliance on local updates. The goal is to improve mixing by introducing global moves that can jump across energy barriers.

Method: Train a Transformer on equilibrium samples to generate entire spin configurations resembling the target distribution. Use these as proposals for global moves within Metropolis steps in Parallel Tempering, complementing single-spin flips.

Result: On 2D Ising models, IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves, generalizes to unseen temperatures including critical regions, and sharply reduces equilibration time. On 3D spin glasses, it finds substantially lower-energy states. For integer factorization, it transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates.

Conclusion: Neural proposals that capture global structure can systematically accelerate Monte Carlo methods, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization, with the ability to generalize across problem instances.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

*Zijian Wang,Xiaofei Zhang,Xin Zhang,Yukun Liu,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel federated learning paradigm where the central server not only aggregates models but also guides new queries to the most appropriate clients using an empirical likelihood framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address statistical heterogeneity in federated learning by leveraging the central server to actively guide task allocation, inspired by healthcare scenarios where hospitals with different patient demographics could be matched to new patients.

Method: Introduces an empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously learns local models on each client and finds the best matching client for new queries.

Result: Empirical results show improvements in both model accuracy and client guidance precision compared to standard FL approaches on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This work opens a new direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature rather than a limitation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

### [172] [Understanding Language Prior of LVLMs by Contrasting Chain-of-Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23050)
*Lin Long,Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes language prior in large vision-language models through chain-of-embedding analysis, revealing a universal Visual Integration Point (VIP) where visual information begins influencing representations, and introduces TVI estimator to quantify visual influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often default to language priors from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence, but existing input-output probing methods fail to reveal internal mechanisms of visual influence.

Method: Systematic analysis through chain-of-embedding examining layer-wise representation dynamics, identifying Visual Integration Point (VIP) and developing Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator to quantify visual influence.

Result: Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, VIP consistently emerges and TVI reliably predicts language prior strength.

Conclusion: Provides a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs through internal representation analysis.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

### [173] [Dynamics of Learning: Generative Schedules from Latent ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23052)
*Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new learning rate scheduler that models training as a dynamical system, using hyperparameter search data to predict optimal long-term schedules, achieving SOTA results across CNN, ResNet, and transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning rate schedules are either simple parametric functions or react only to short-term signals, lacking a comprehensive temporal view of neural network training performance.

Method: Learns latent representations from hyperparameter search training runs, models training as a dynamical system, and predicts future learning rate schedules that optimize long-term validation performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results for image classification with CNN/ResNet and next-token prediction with transformers. Trained models are in flatter loss regions with better generalization.

Conclusion: The scheduler is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, easily integrable with ML platforms, and generalizes beyond observed training dynamics to create specialized schedules.

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

### [174] [Beyond Model Ranking: Predictability-Aligned Evaluation for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23074)
*Wanjin Feng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel predictability-aligned diagnostic framework using spectral coherence to address flaws in standard forecasting evaluation metrics that conflate model performance with data unpredictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluation metrics for time series forecasting fail to distinguish between model performance and data's intrinsic unpredictability, leading to unfair model comparisons on benchmark leaderboards.

Method: Introduced Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP) to quantify forecasting difficulty and Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR) to measure how effectively models exploit linearly predictable information, both based on spectral coherence analysis.

Result: Revealed two key insights: systematic evidence of "predictability drift" showing forecasting difficulty varies over time, and an architectural trade-off where complex models excel on low-predictability data while linear models are effective on predictable tasks.

Conclusion: Advocates for a paradigm shift from simplistic aggregate scores to predictability-aware evaluation that enables fairer model comparisons and deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

### [175] [CLAD-Net: Continual Activity Recognition in Multi-Sensor Wearable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23077)
*Reza Rahimi Azghan,Gautham Krishna Gudur,Mohit Malu,Edison Thomaz,Giulia Pedrielli,Pavan Turaga,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAD-Net is a continual learning framework that addresses catastrophic forgetting in human activity recognition from wearable sensors by combining a self-supervised transformer for long-term memory with a supervised CNN trained via knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world wearable sensor data suffers from distribution shifts between subjects and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings, compounded by limited labeled data availability in human studies.

Method: CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer that captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across body sensors as long-term memory, and a supervised CNN that uses knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge during subject-wise fine-tuning.

Result: On PAMAP2 dataset, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36% final accuracy with only 8.78% forgetting, outperforming memory-based and regularization-based baselines. It maintains strong performance even with only 10-20% labeled data in semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: CLAD-Net effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for human activity recognition, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts and label scarcity through its dual architecture of transformer-based long-term memory and distillation-trained CNN.

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

### [176] [Signal Preserving Weight Initialization for Odd-Sigmoid Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23085)
*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an initialization method tailored to odd sigmoid activation functions to prevent saturation and variance collapse, enabling reliable training without normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation functions and weight initialization are interdependent, but standard initialization methods often fail with certain nonlinearities, causing saturation, variance collapse, and learning rate sensitivity.

Method: Defines an odd sigmoid function class and develops a closed-form initialization method that selects noise scale to keep forward activations well dispersed up to target layers.

Result: The approach trains reliably without normalization layers, shows strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations where standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often fail to converge.

Conclusion: Tailored initialization methods for specific activation function classes can overcome limitations of standard approaches and enable reliable training without normalization layers.

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

### [177] [Unleashing Flow Policies with Distributional Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23087)
*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a novel critic architecture that models the complete state-action return distribution using flow matching, addressing limitations of traditional scalar critics and improving performance in offline and offline-to-online RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based policies are powerful for modeling multimodal behaviors but are bottlenecked by traditional critics that only learn single scalar estimates of expected return, limiting their full potential.

Method: DFC uses flow matching to model the return distribution as a continuous transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target distribution, providing rich distributional Bellman targets for flow-based policies.

Result: Extensive experiments on D4RL and OGBench benchmarks show strong performance, particularly on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excel in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DFC successfully addresses the limitations of scalar critics by providing expressive flow-based policies with stable and informative distributional learning signals, achieving superior performance in complex RL scenarios.

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of Network Foundation Models (NFMs) reveals significant limitations in latent representations including anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity, and inability to separate high-level context, with fixes improving performance by up to +0.35 F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) through hidden representations analysis rather than just downstream task performance, as existing efforts focus primarily on performance metrics.

Method: Three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis (representation space utilization), Metric Alignment Assessment (correspondence with domain-expert features), and Causal Sensitivity Testing (robustness to protocol perturbations). Evaluated four state-of-the-art NFMs on five diverse network datasets.

Result: All NFMs exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, inability to separate high-level context, payload dependency, and other limitations. Addressing these limitations can significantly improve model performance by up to +0.35 F1 score without architectural changes.

Conclusion: Current NFMs have fundamental limitations in their latent representations that impact their effectiveness, but systematically identifying and addressing these issues can lead to substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

*Christopher Scarvelis,Justin Solomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a method to compute how diffusion model outputs change with small training data perturbations, without needing retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict how score functions and generated samples would change under small training set perturbations before committing to costly retraining.

Method: Closed-form procedure for computing directional derivatives of the score function map, using only pre-trained score model and its input derivatives. Extended to estimate sample sensitivity to target measure perturbations.

Result: Method is robust to numerical/approximation error, with runtime comparable to sampling and log-likelihood computation. Sensitivities correlate with actual sample changes after retraining/fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Enables efficient prediction of diffusion model behavior changes under data perturbations without retraining, using only existing model access.

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-PO is a reward-shaping framework that enhances policy optimization with causal coherence signals to reduce reward hacking and improve reasoning faithfulness in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained with reinforcement objectives often achieve correct answers through shortcut strategies with unfaithful reasoning, degrading under causal perturbations.

Method: Uses Jacobian-based sensitivities to estimate model-internal influence, counterfactually hardens signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses coherence scores with task-accuracy feedback via Minkowski combiner.

Result: Improves accuracy by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%) across 4 datasets, reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought, and enhances robustness to correlation-causation flips and counterfactual edits.

Conclusion: CE-PO effectively improves reasoning faithfulness and robustness in LLMs while maintaining accuracy, providing a unified framework for balancing accuracy and causal coherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

TL;DR: An ensemble framework combining GCN, GAT, and GIN models achieves high recall for blockchain fraud detection with low false positive rates, featuring quantum-ready design for future scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blockchain's pseudonymous nature enables illicit activities, challenging AML enforcement. Current fraud detection needs models that handle structural/temporal dependencies while being resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior.

Method: Proposed ensemble framework integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with tuned soft voting. Uses real-world Elliptic dataset and includes quantum-ready design hooks.

Result: Achieved high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining false positive rate below 1%, outperforming individual GNN models and baseline methods.

Conclusion: Ensemble GNNs provide practical solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring with immediate AML utility and pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

TL;DR: 8-bit Muon optimizer using blockwise quantization reduces memory footprint by ~74% while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision Muon, outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer shows faster convergence than AdamW but is stateful like AdamW, requiring storage of both weights and gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants exist, they are typically stable only under dynamic quantization.

Method: Introduce 8-bit Muon optimizer using blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic quantization schemes.

Result: 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both quantization schemes, reduces memory footprint by ~74% compared to full-precision Muon, and matches Muon's performance while outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pretraining a 1.6B model on 4B tokens.

Conclusion: 8-bit Muon is an efficient and robust optimizer that maintains performance while significantly reducing memory requirements, with theoretical perspective provided to explain its quantization robustness.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

TL;DR: RHYTHM is a unified framework that uses LLMs for human mobility prediction by employing temporal tokenization and hierarchical attention to capture daily/weekly dependencies while reducing sequence length and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility prediction is challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors that existing methods struggle to capture effectively.

Method: Uses temporal tokenization to partition trajectories into daily segments, encodes them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention, adds pre-computed prompt embeddings via frozen LLM, and freezes the pretrained LLM backbone to reduce computational complexity.

Result: Achieves 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in training time compared to state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RHYTHM effectively leverages LLMs as spatio-temporal predictors by addressing sequence length and computational challenges through temporal tokenization and hierarchical attention, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

### [184] [Impute-MACFM: Imputation based on Mask-Aware Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23126)
*Dengyi Liu,Honggang Wang,Hua Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Impute-MACFM is a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular data imputation that handles all missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) through stable, efficient flow-based generation with constraints on observed values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data, especially in healthcare, often contains missing values that undermine model reliability. Existing methods either make restrictive assumptions, struggle with complex feature relationships, or suffer from instability and high computational costs.

Method: Uses mask-aware conditional flow matching with trajectories only on missing entries, stability penalties on observed positions, consistency regularization, and time-decayed noise injection. Inference employs constraint-preserving ODE integration with per-step projection to fix observed values.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing approaches.

Conclusion: Flow matching establishes a promising direction for tabular missing-data problems, particularly effective for longitudinal data with complex missingness patterns.

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

*Haotian Liu,Shuo Wang,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C²GSPG is a confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method that enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence in reinforcement learning for reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like GRPO suffer from overconfidence issues that prevent achieving self-aware reasoning models, limiting their effectiveness in reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework to eliminate token-level bias, defines model confidence using normalized sequence-level probability, and applies cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate confidence to reward. Uses nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive clipping for non-binary rewards.

Result: C²GSPG shows superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration when applied to logical and mathematical reasoning tasks with large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses overconfidence issues in RL-based reasoning models while improving performance, with collaborative objectives for binary rewards and conflict mitigation for non-binary rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

TL;DR: TRRO is a new IRL framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in expert behavior likelihood via Minorization-Maximization, addressing training instability in adversarial IRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern IRL methods using adversarial formulations suffer from unstable training, while recent non-adversarial approaches lack formal guarantees despite improved stability.

Method: Proposed Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO) framework that maximizes expert behavior likelihood via Minorization-Maximization, instantiated as Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO) algorithm.

Result: PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery and policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo, Gym-Robotics benchmarks, and real-world animal behavior modeling.

Conclusion: TRRO provides IRL counterpart to TRPO's stability guarantees in forward RL, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach for stable IRL training.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

*Sipeng Chen,Yan Zhang,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiINR is a unified framework that formulates INR configuration as an optimization problem using Bayesian optimization to find optimal activation functions and initialization parameters, replacing manual tuning with systematic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current INR practice relies on ad-hoc heuristics and grid searches for configuration, leading to inconsistent results across modalities. There's a need for principled strategies for optimal INR configuration spanning activation selection, initialization scales, and layer-wise adaptation.

Method: Leverages Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the joint space of discrete activation families (SIREN, WIRE, FINER) and their continuous initialization parameters, replacing manual tuning with data-driven optimization.

Result: OptiINR delivers globally optimal configurations that consistently maximize performance across diverse signal processing applications, establishing a principled foundation for INR design.

Conclusion: OptiINR provides a systematic, unified framework for INR configuration that replaces fragmented manual tuning with rigorous optimization, ensuring consistent performance across different modalities.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

*Xiaowen Ma,Shuning Ge,Fan Yang,Xiangyu Li,Yun Chen,Mengting Ma,Wei Zhang,Zhipeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeExpert introduces Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE) to replace vanilla attention in Transformers, addressing lag effects and anomalies in time series data through adaptive expert selection and global dependency preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' rigid global attention fails to handle dynamic lag effects where historical relevance varies, and anomalous segments that introduce noise, limiting forecasting accuracy in real-world time series data.

Method: Proposes TMOE that treats key-value pairs as local experts specialized in temporal contexts, performs adaptive expert selection via localized filtering, and maintains a shared global expert for long-range dependencies. Replaces attention in PatchTST and Timer frameworks without structural changes.

Result: TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance without extra structural modifications.

Conclusion: TMOE effectively addresses Transformer limitations in time series modeling by combining local expert adaptation with global dependency preservation, achieving superior forecasting accuracy across diverse real-world datasets.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: Mirror-Critique trains verifiers with informative critiques by contrasting model-generated solutions with ground-truth solutions, using synthetic critique data to improve verification and enable better solution selection than majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward model selection in test-time scaling fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers due to lack of informative critique signals during verifier training.

Method: Leverage contrast between model-generated and ground-truth solutions, use small instruction-tuned model to synthesize high-quality critique data via rejection sampling, cold-start LLMs in RLVR process, and aggregate multiple critiques into verify scores for weighted voting/abstention.

Result: Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting in solution accuracy and improves solver's honesty to recognize and abstain from answering beyond capability boundaries.

Conclusion: The Mirror-Critique framework successfully addresses limitations of current verification approaches by providing informative critique signals, leading to better solution selection and improved model honesty.

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalGym is an open-source RL environment for crystalline material discovery that enables direct DFT feedback in material design through online reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current machine learning approaches that avoid direct DFT signals due to computational costs, and to enable reinforcement learning methods to use DFT calculations as feedback in material design loops.

Method: Developed CrystalGym environment for benchmarking RL algorithms on crystalline material design tasks, using DFT-calculated properties (band gap, bulk modulus, density) as rewards, and conducted extensive experiments with value- and policy-based RL algorithms.

Result: Benchmarked algorithms showed varying sample efficiencies and convergence behaviors across different CrystalGym tasks, with no single algorithm solving all tasks. Included case study on fine-tuning LLMs with RL for DFT-based rewards.

Conclusion: CrystalGym serves as a test bed for RL researchers and material scientists, introducing challenges for RL methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals and enabling future interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

TL;DR: LSTM model with routine-aware augmentation and demographic personalization improves cognitive impairment detection from smartphone sensing data in older adults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical but infrequent clinical assessments lack sensitivity and temporal resolution for subtle cognitive declines.

Method: Implemented LSTM model with two techniques: routine-aware augmentation (generating synthetic sequences by replacing days with behaviorally similar alternatives) and demographic personalization (reweighting training samples to emphasize demographically similar individuals).

Result: Joint techniques improved AUPRC from 0.637 to 0.766 on 6-month data from 36 older adults.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations using passive smartphone sensing.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

TL;DR: ProtoTS is an interpretable time series forecasting framework that uses prototypical temporal patterns to achieve high accuracy while providing transparent, multi-level explanations of how input variables shape forecast curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretable forecasting models only provide local and partial explanations, lacking the ability to show how heterogeneous input variables jointly shape overall temporal patterns in forecasts, which is crucial for trust in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity using denoised representations that preserve heterogeneous information, with prototypes organized hierarchically to capture both global temporal patterns (coarse prototypes) and finer-grained local variations (detailed prototypes).

Result: Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks including the LOF dataset show ProtoTS exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy while providing expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

Conclusion: ProtoTS successfully bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability in time series forecasting by modeling prototypical temporal patterns hierarchically, enabling both high performance and transparent decision-making.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense associative memory models are limited to vector representations, while many real-world data naturally exist as distributions. This work bridges the gap between classical associative memories and modern generative modeling.

Method: Defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored distributions and retrieval dynamics that aggregate optimal transport maps in a Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent Wasserstein barycenters.

Result: Proves exponential storage capacity and provides quantitative retrieval guarantees under Wasserstein perturbations. Validates the model on synthetic and real-world distributional tasks.

Conclusion: Elevates associative memory from vectors to full distributions, enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning systems.

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Operator Models in scientific machine learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has been effective in vision and language processing but remains unexplored in scientific machine learning for modeling complex physical systems. The study aims to adapt PEFT techniques to pre-trained Large Operator Models.

Method: The authors systematically study PEFT for Large Operator Models, finding that adapters outperform LoRA. They theoretically analyze stacked LoRA's limitations in Fourier layers and introduce F-Adapter, which allocates adapter capacity based on spectral complexity - higher dimensions for low-frequency components and lower dimensions for high-frequency components.

Result: F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, significantly improving both generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques commonly used in LLMs.

Conclusion: This work is the first to explore PEFT for scientific machine learning and establishes F-Adapter as an effective paradigm for this domain, with adapters showing superior performance over LoRA due to their ability to concentrate parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam is an asymmetric Siamese architecture that prevents collapse in test-time entropy minimization by using asymmetric divergence alignment with a learnable predictor and stop-gradient operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure entropy minimization during test-time adaptation can lead to collapsed solutions like constant one-hot outputs that trivially minimize entropy without meaningful learning, favoring non-generalizable shortcuts.

Method: ZeroSiam uses an asymmetric Siamese architecture with asymmetric divergence alignment, implemented via a learnable predictor and stop-gradient operator before the classifier to prevent collapse.

Result: ZeroSiam performs more stably than prior methods with negligible overhead, prevents collapse solutions, and enhances performance even when no collapse occurs by absorbing and regularizing biased learning signals.

Conclusion: ZeroSiam effectively addresses collapse issues in test-time entropy minimization, demonstrating efficacy across vision adaptation and large language model reasoning tasks, including with tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

TL;DR: CoSIFL is a federated learning framework that combines proactive security alarming, local differential privacy, and Stackelberg-based incentives to address security threats and client participation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces security threats from malicious clients and difficulties in incentivizing participation while maintaining privacy. Current approaches lack integrated solutions for security, privacy, and incentives.

Method: CoSIFL integrates proactive alarming with LDP for security, uses robust aggregation against Byzantine attacks, and implements a Tullock contest-inspired incentive scheme. It formulates server-client interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg game.

Result: Experimental results show CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in model robustness and reduces total server costs. The framework achieves unique equilibrium in server-client interactions.

Conclusion: The integrated design of CoSIFL effectively addresses security, privacy, and incentive challenges in federated learning, demonstrating improved performance over existing solutions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect

TL;DR: This paper presents MR-GPTQ, a specialized quantization method for 4-bit floating-point formats (MXFP4 and NVFP4) that addresses their limitations through block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware-accelerated 4-bit floating-point formats like MXFP4 and NVFP4 promise to revolutionize LLM inference but their practical benefits remain unproven, with existing methods struggling due to format-specific issues like small group sizes and power-of-two scale quantization.

Method: The authors introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of GPTQ that uses block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations, supported by high-performance GPU kernels that enable rotation fusion into weights and fast online computation of activations.

Result: MR-GPTQ achieves speedups of up to 3.6x layer-wise and 2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on RTX5090, while matching or outperforming state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly boosting MXFP4 performance to near NVFP4 levels.

Conclusion: While FP4 is not an automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock new accuracy-performance trade-offs for 4-bit floating-point quantization in LLM inference.

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

*Wenhao Zhang,Shao Zhang,Xihuai Wang,Yang Li,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies Contextual Ambiguity as a critical flaw in In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) where models fail to show continuous improvement during testing, and proposes CV-ICRL with Context Value to resolve this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICRL approaches trained on monotonic policy improvement data cannot achieve continuous improvement during testing due to Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's stochastic actions generate misleading interaction histories.

Method: Proposes Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL) that uses Context Value as an explicit signal representing ideal performance achievable given current context, with two methods for estimating Context Value at training and testing time.

Result: Experiments on Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds show CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL abilities across various tasks and environments.

Conclusion: CV-ICRL successfully resolves Contextual Ambiguity in ICRL by incorporating Context Value, enabling models to achieve continuous improvement during testing and demonstrating improved performance across multiple environments.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WirelessMathLM demonstrates that compact models (0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models in specialized wireless mathematics through domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, achieving near-GPT-4o performance while using 100x fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models fail catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics like wireless communications, which require precise manipulation of information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing formulations.

Method: Used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards, training models directly from base checkpoints without supervised warm-start. Leveraged the unique property of wireless mathematics problems having verifiable correctness for effective reinforcement learning without human feedback.

Result: The 7B model achieved 39.5% accuracy on WirelessMathBench-XL (4,027 problems from 970 papers), approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using ~100x fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). GRPO training nearly doubled performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B +81%).

Conclusion: Domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards enables compact models to excel in specialized technical mathematics, with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks (+8.4 points average gain on MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and AIME without training on these tasks).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL accelerates RL training for LLMs by reusing overlapping trajectory segments from consecutive epochs through speculative decoding, reducing rollout time 2-3x without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for LLMs is bottlenecked by computationally expensive rollout stages, and existing acceleration methods either have diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.

Method: Proposes SPEC-RL framework that integrates speculative decoding with RL rollout process, reusing prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extending them via draft-and-verify mechanism to avoid redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency.

Result: Experiments on math reasoning and generalization benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM) show 2-3x reduction in rollout time without compromising policy quality.

Conclusion: SPEC-RL offers a general and practical enhancement for scaling RL with verifiable rewards for large reasoning models, seamlessly integrating with mainstream RL algorithms like PPO, GRPO, and DAPO.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

*Shayan Alahyari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LatentDiff is a novel framework using conditional diffusion models with priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in latent space for deep imbalanced regression, addressing the gap in data-level solutions for high-dimensional imbalanced regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep imbalanced regression lacks dedicated data-level solutions for high-dimensional data, with current approaches relying mainly on algorithmic modifications rather than addressing data imbalance directly through synthetic sample generation.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion models with priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent representation space, making it computationally efficient and applicable across diverse data modalities including images, text, and other high-dimensional inputs.

Result: Experiments on three deep imbalanced regression benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall accuracy.

Conclusion: LatentDiff effectively addresses the data imbalance problem in deep regression tasks by generating synthetic minority samples in latent space, providing a practical data-level solution for high-dimensional imbalanced regression.

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

### [203] [Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246)
*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATDP is a novel differential privacy method that focuses noise injection on sensitive tokens rather than uniform noise across all gradients, reducing training time by 90% while maintaining privacy protection and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DP-SGD methods inject uniform noise across all gradients, which significantly increases training time and reduces model accuracy. There's a need for more efficient privacy protection that specifically targets sensitive information.

Method: ATDP adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive and non-sensitive tokens, using larger noise scale early in training to disrupt memorization. It requires only a few additional epochs of lightweight post-processing after standard fine-tuning.

Result: ATDP achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods while reducing training time by approximately 90%. It maintains comparable or superior privacy protection with minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: ATDP provides an efficient alternative to traditional DP-SGD by concentrating noise on sensitive tokens, enabling faster training while preserving privacy and model capabilities. It can be easily integrated into existing pipelines or applied to non-private models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

*Vladimir Fanaskov,Vladislav Trifonov,Alexander Rudikov,Ekaterina Muravleva,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes neural network-based subspace regression for parametric reduced order modeling, using redundant larger subspaces to simplify learning and improve accuracy in high-dimensional parameter spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical interpolation strategies become infeasible for high-dimensional parameter spaces in reduced order modeling, requiring new approaches to approximate subspaces for unknown parameters.

Method: Relax interpolation to regression, use neural networks to approximate high-dimensional target functions, and introduce redundancy by predicting larger subspaces than needed to simplify learning.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows reduced complexity for elliptic eigenproblems and smoother mappings on Grassmann manifold. Empirical results demonstrate significant accuracy improvement with redundant subspaces.

Conclusion: Subspace regression with neural networks and redundant subspace prediction is effective for various tasks including parametric eigenproblems, PDEs, and optimal control in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

TL;DR: NanoFlux is an adversarial framework that generates small targeted datasets (<200 examples) to improve LLM reasoning, outperforming conventional fine-tuning with 3-14x computational efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of conventional fine-tuning approaches and improve LLM reasoning capabilities through precisely targeted training data.

Method: Uses competitive dynamics between Attacker and Defender models supervised by a tool-augmented Judge to synthesize multi-step questions with explanatory annotations targeting specific reasoning capabilities, with embedding-based novelty filtering.

Result: Fine-tuning on NanoFlux data achieved significant performance gains: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning, +3.6% on scientific reasoning, +16.6% on medical reasoning, while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Future model improvements may come from intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets rather than large-scale data, with domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen interfaces is critical for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development, but reliable predictions from sequences alone remain challenging.

Method: Uses Conformer backbone to capture local and global sequence features, introduces physics-inspired sliding attention for residue-level contact recovery without 3D structural data, and can predict paratopes/epitopes with or without antibody information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, surpasses sequence-based methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction, and ablation studies show sliding attention significantly enhances epitope prediction precision.

Conclusion: ABCONFORMER provides an effective sequence-based approach for antibody-antigen interface prediction, with sliding attention being a key innovation that improves performance over conventional methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

TL;DR: CREPE is a new inference-time control method for diffusion models that uses replica exchange instead of Sequential Monte Carlo, offering sequential particle generation, high sample diversity, and online refinement capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time control methods for diffusion models rely on heuristic guidance or Sequential Monte Carlo with bias correction, which have limitations in flexibility and sample diversity.

Method: Proposes CREPE (Controlling with REPlica Exchange), adapting replica exchange algorithm from sampling problems to diffusion model control. It generates particles sequentially, maintains diversity after burn-in, and allows online refinement.

Result: Demonstrated versatility across temperature annealing, reward-tilting, model composition, and classifier-free guidance debiasing tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Conclusion: CREPE provides a flexible alternative to SMC-based approaches for inference-time control of diffusion models, offering advantages in sequential generation, sample diversity, and online refinement capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

TL;DR: Machine learning approaches including transfer learning, de-novo Random Survival Forests, and ensemble integration improve breast cancer survival prognostication compared to traditional PREDICT v3 tool, especially when dealing with missing data or dataset shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance breast cancer survival prognostication using more accessible clinicopathological data rather than costly genomic tools, leveraging machine learning capabilities to handle missing information and improve robustness.

Method: Used MA.27 trial data for training with external validation on TEAM trial and SEER cohort. Compared three approaches: transfer learning by fine-tuning PREDICT v3, de-novo ML (Random Survival Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting), and ensemble integration through weighted sum of model predictions.

Result: Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration improved calibration (ICI reduced from 0.042 to ≤0.007) while maintaining comparable discrimination (AUC increased from 0.738 to 0.744-0.799). ML models could predict survival regardless of missing information, unlike PREDICT v3 which failed in 23.8-25.8% of cases. Key features identified were patient age, nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size.

Conclusion: Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication when PREDICT v3 information is lacking or dataset shifts occur, providing more robust and accessible breast cancer survival prediction tools.

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a continuous-time RL approach for Asset-Liability Management using linear-quadratic formulation with policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm and adaptive exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more effective Asset-Liability Management (ALM) approach that dynamically synchronizes assets and liabilities using reinforcement learning, overcoming limitations of traditional financial strategies.

Method: Model-free policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm with linear-quadratic formulation, featuring adaptive exploration for actor and scheduled exploration for critic to balance exploration-exploitation.

Result: Achieves higher average rewards than all alternative strategies across 200 randomized market scenarios, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance.

Conclusion: The method outperforms traditional financial strategies and other RL algorithms by directly learning optimal ALM strategy without complex neural networks or environment modeling.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic management, airline operations, and environmental assessment, but existing models have limitations in reproducing recorded trajectories.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

*Xvyuan Liu,Xiangfei Qiu,Hanyin Cheng,Xingjian Wu,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang,Jilin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTGI is a framework for irregular multivariate time series forecasting that addresses challenges of data representation and dependency capture through spatio-temporal point representation, adaptive graph construction, dynamic propagation, and query-based prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular multivariate time series with asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals pose challenges for accurate representation and dependency modeling in critical domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: ASTGI uses: 1) Spatio-Temporal Point Representation to encode observations, 2) Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction via nearest neighbors, 3) Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation for information updates, and 4) Query Point-based Prediction for final forecasting.

Result: Extensive experiments show ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed ASTGI framework effectively addresses the core challenges of irregular multivariate time series forecasting through adaptive spatio-temporal graph interactions.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

### [212] [Two-Scale Latent Dynamics for Recurrent-Depth Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23314)
*Francesco Pappone,Donato Crisostomi,Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent-depth transformers use iterative latent computations before token emission, exhibiting two-scale dynamics: small refinements within blocks and larger drift across blocks. An early-exit mechanism based on second-order step-size differences outperforms KL-divergence and first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric properties of iterative computations in recurrent-depth transformers and develop more efficient early-exit strategies based on observed dynamics.

Method: Analyzed the geometry of iterates in recurrent-depth transformers, measuring loop step sizes and orthogonality across checkpoints. Proposed an early-exit mechanism using second-order differences in step-size.

Result: Found that loop steps become smaller and more orthogonal over time, indicating better local modeling. The second-order early-exit method showed superior performance, stability, and time-efficiency compared to KL-divergence and first-order approaches.

Conclusion: The two-scale operational picture provides insights into transformer dynamics, and second-order step-size differences offer an effective criterion for early-exit mechanisms in recurrent-depth transformers.

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

*Khang Tran,Hieu Cao,Thinh Pham,Nghiem Diep,Tri Cao,Binh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MELCOT is a hybrid model combining classical machine learning (Marginal Estimation) with deep learning (Learnable-Cost Optimal Transport) for matrix-valued regression, achieving superior performance and efficiency in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression methods struggle with high-dimensional data, often losing spatial structure or requiring excessive storage, particularly for matrix-valued data where samples are naturally represented as matrices.

Method: MELCOT integrates two blocks: ME block for estimating data marginals to preserve spatial information, and LCOT block for learning complex global features through learnable-cost optimal transport.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and domains show MELCOT consistently outperforms all baseline methods while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach of MELCOT successfully combines classical and deep learning strengths, providing an effective solution for matrix-valued regression in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

*Xiangchen Song,Jiaqi Sun,Zijian Li,Yujia Zheng,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework for LLMs that captures both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations, providing theoretical guarantees and advancing LLM interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability tools like sparse autoencoders lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and theoretical guarantees, which undermines both theoretical foundations and practical confidence for LLM analysis.

Method: An identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, extending SAE techniques to capture both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations.

Result: The approach demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity and successfully discovers meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations.

Conclusion: Modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs, bridging the gap between causal representation learning and practical LLM analysis.

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

*Jonas Ngnawé,Maxime Heuillet,Sabyasachi Sahoo,Yann Pequignot,Ola Ahmad,Audrey Durand,Frédéric Precioso,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning non-robust pretrained models with robust objectives can cause suboptimal transfer, leading to poor performance. The paper proposes Epsilon-Scheduling to prevent this and introduces expected robustness for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robust fine-tuning (RFT) that simultaneously achieves task adaptation and adversarial robustness, particularly when using abundant non-robust pretrained models from open-source repositories.

Method: Systematically examines RFT from non-robust models, identifies suboptimal transfer phenomenon, and proposes Epsilon-Scheduling - a schedule over perturbation strength during training that promotes optimal transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments across six pretrained models and five datasets show that Epsilon-Scheduling successfully prevents suboptimal transfer and consistently improves expected robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed Epsilon-Scheduling heuristic effectively addresses the suboptimal transfer problem in robust fine-tuning and provides better accuracy-robustness trade-off across diverse models and datasets.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark for evaluating Schrödinger bridge (SB) methods on discrete spaces, providing pairs of distributions with known analytical solutions for rigorous testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains for generative modeling, but no reliable way exists to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.

Method: The authors construct a benchmark that yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically known SB solutions. As a byproduct, they develop two new SB algorithms (DLightSB and DLightSB-M) and extend prior work to create the α-CSBM algorithm.

Result: The benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of SB solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings, demonstrating utility by testing both existing and new algorithms.

Conclusion: This work provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies in this area.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

*Andrey Kharitenko,Zebang Shen,Riccardo de Santi,Niao He,Florian Doerfler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for Riemannian optimization over data manifolds using diffusion model score functions, proposing two efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees for manifold adherence and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data lies near low-dimensional manifolds, but classical optimization methods require explicit manifold operations which are unavailable when manifolds are given only through data distributions. This is crucial for data-driven design problems in generative AI.

Method: Introduces a link function connecting data distribution to geometric operations, leveraging diffusion model score functions. Proposes two algorithms: Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD) that use pretrained score networks.

Result: The methods enable recovery of essential manifold operations (retraction, Riemannian gradient computation) and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm).

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses data-driven optimization problems, demonstrating practical potential in generative and design applications, particularly in data-driven control tasks.

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

*Hanlin Zhu,Shibo Hao,Zhiting Hu,Jiantao Jiao,Stuart Russell,Yuandong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how continuous chain of thought (CoT) enables superposition of multiple reasoning traces in transformers, revealing a two-stage training process where index-matching logits first increase then remain bounded to balance exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the superposition mechanism in continuous CoT naturally emerges from gradient-based training, as previous work showed theoretical capabilities but lacked insight into the learning dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of training dynamics in a simplified two-layer transformer on directed graph reachability, examining two training stages: thought-generation (autoregressive expansion) and prediction (converting thought to answer).

Result: Analysis reveals that index-matching logits first increase then remain bounded, enabling balanced exploration-exploitation that assigns comparable weights to multiple plausible reasoning traces, resulting in superposition.

Conclusion: The bounded index-matching logit mechanism naturally emerges during training and effectively balances local search exploitation with multiple trace exploration, explaining how superposition occurs in continuous CoT reasoning.

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

*Ange-Clément Akazan,Verlon Roel Mbingui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-based feature selection methods provide competitive performance to classical baselines, offering interpretable importance measures through spline parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional datasets need effective feature selection for better predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness.

Method: Proposed four KAN-based selectors (KAN-L1, KAN-L2, KAN-SI, KAN-KO) and compared them against classical baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) on classification and regression tabular datasets.

Result: KAN-based selectors are competitive with and sometimes superior to classical baselines, with KAN-L2 and KAN-SI performing well on noisy regression and heterogeneous datasets, while KAN-L1, KAN-KO, and KAN-SI excel in classification tasks.

Conclusion: KAN-based feature selection offers a powerful and interpretable alternative to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

*Xi Ding,Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR) is a framework that uses model predictions to create relational graphs that regularize feature learning, promoting class-aware semantic representations through parameter-free graph consistency layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks learn rich representations but often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics, requiring a method to enforce semantic consistency throughout the network.

Method: GCR introduces Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) that build feature similarity graphs and align them with class-aware masked prediction graphs using adaptive weighting to prioritize semantically reliable layers.

Result: GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization across various networks and datasets without modifying architecture or training procedure.

Conclusion: GCR offers a model-agnostic, lightweight approach to enhance semantic feature structure through self-prompting from prediction structure, providing a new perspective on learning from model outputs.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the training-inference mismatch in diffusion language models caused by planning-based sampling strategies, proposing a new training objective (P-ELBO) and method (PAPL) that align training with planned inference paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planners in diffusion language models create a mismatch between uniformly random training paths and planning-based inference paths, which the standard ELBO doesn't properly account for.

Method: Derived Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) and proposed Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL) to incorporate planner-based reverse dynamics into training.

Result: PAPL achieved significant improvements: 40% gain in protein modeling, 4x MAUVE improvement in text generation, and 23% gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Conclusion: Aligning training with planned inference through PAPL effectively bridges the training-inference gap and delivers substantial performance gains across multiple domains.

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-view edge classification framework for multiplex link prediction using cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence across layers, with two model variants and leakage-free evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiplex link prediction methods either collapse layers or treat them independently, losing crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggling with scalability.

Method: Frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification, construct sequences of per-layer edge views, apply cross-layer self-attention for fusion. Two models: Trans-SLE (transformer over static embeddings) and Trans-GAT (layer-specific GAT encoders with transformer fusion).

Result: Experiments on six public multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F1 gains over strong baselines (MELL, HOPLP-MUL, RMNE).

Conclusion: The approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders, with introduced Union-Set candidate pool and leakage-free protocols ensuring fairness.

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both

### [223] [PATCH: Learnable Tile-level Hybrid Sparsity for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23410)
*Younes Hourri,Mohammad Mozaffari,Maryam Mehri Dehnavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH is a hybrid sparsity framework that enables continuous sparsity ratios between 0% and 50% by partitioning weight matrices into tiles and assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse, achieving better accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs than existing pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model pruning approaches face limitations: unstructured sparsity preserves accuracy but prevents GPU acceleration due to irregular access patterns, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality.

Method: PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles and uses a learnable mask selection mechanism to assign each tile as either dense or 2:4 sparse, providing fine-grained control over sparsity and supporting non-uniform sparsity across layers.

Result: Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. On LLaMA-2 7B with A6000 GPU, it achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method MaskLLM.

Conclusion: PATCH successfully bridges the gap between unstructured and structured sparsity by enabling continuous sparsity ratios, delivering both improved accuracy and practical acceleration for large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

*Changliang Zhou,Canhong Yu,Shunyu Yao,Xi Lin,Zhenkun Wang,Yu Zhou,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: URS is a unified neural routing solver that achieves zero-shot generalization across 100+ VRP variants using a single model without fine-tuning, through unified data representation, mixed bias learning, and LLM-driven constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural solvers rely on predefined constraints or per-problem fine-tuning, limiting their zero-shot generalization to unseen VRP variants.

Method: Proposes Unified Data Representation (UDR) for data unification, Mixed Bias Module (MBM) for learning geometric/relational biases, parameter generator for adaptive decoding, and LLM-driven constraint satisfaction mechanism.

Result: URS consistently produces high-quality solutions for 100+ distinct VRP variants (including 90+ unseen variants) without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: URS is the first neural solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model, demonstrating superior zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

### [225] [LOTFormer: Doubly-Stochastic Linear Attention via Low-Rank Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23436)
*Ashkan Shahbazi,Chayne Thrash,Yikun Bai,Keaton Hamm,Navid NaderiAlizadeh,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTFormer is a linear-time doubly-stochastic attention mechanism that uses entropic optimal transport between queries, a learnable pivot measure, and keys to create low-rank attention maps, achieving SOTA results on Long Range Arena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention has quadratic complexity that limits scaling to long contexts, while linear attention methods can over-focus on few tokens. Doubly-stochastic attention balances participation but existing methods introduce overhead.

Method: Proposes LOTFormer that solves two entropic optimal transport problems (queries→pivot and pivot→keys) using a learnable pivot measure with small support, creating a low-rank doubly-stochastic attention matrix that runs in O(nr) time.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: LOTFormer provides a principled approach for simultaneously achieving linear-time computation and doubly-stochastic attention, enabling effective scaling to long contexts while maintaining balanced token participation.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

*Steve Hong,Runa Eschenhagen,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Richard Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Better Hessian approximations consistently improve influence function performance for data attribution in deep learning, with K-FAC eigenvalue mismatch being the main source of error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different Hessian approximation methods affect the quality of influence function attributions in deep learning, since it's unclear whether better approximations actually lead to better data attribution performance.

Method: Investigated the effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a controlled classification setting, decomposing approximation steps for recent methods like GGN and K-FAC.

Result: Better Hessian approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, with K-FAC eigenvalue mismatch accounting for the majority of error and influence loss.

Conclusion: The findings justify research efforts toward better Hessian approximations and highlight which approximations are most critical, guiding future work to balance computational tractability and attribution accuracy.

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data removal approach that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss perturbation to maintain performance while protecting privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User privacy protection and regulatory compliance require sensitive data removal in model training, but this process often causes distributional shifts that degrade model performance, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Proposes a discriminative-preserving factor decorrelation module with dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative representation updating, plus a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive accuracy and robustness under significant distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios for privacy-preserving model training.

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHASE is a physics-integrated AI surrogate framework that accelerates scientific simulations by 60x, reducing required integration time from 1,200+ years to just 20 years while maintaining physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale scientific simulations face prohibitive computational costs, and existing AI surrogates lack physical plausibility and trustworthiness needed for mission-critical applications.

Method: PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with multi-level physics-based constraints that ensure consistency from local dynamics to global system behavior.

Result: PHASE achieved 60x acceleration in biogeochemical spin-up workflow, inferring near-equilibrium state using only 20 simulation years instead of 1,200+ years, with strong generalization to higher resolutions.

Conclusion: PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent acceleration of complex scientific workflows like land-surface modeling.

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate machine learning training while maintaining performance by identifying informative data samples that contribute significantly to training, addressing data efficiency in large-scale learning.

Method: Dynamic sampling framework using loss dynamics and augmented loss differences for batch-level data selection, with optional set-level pruning (ESWP) for further acceleration. Flexible frequency tuning reduces back propagation time.

Result: Achieves lossless training accelerations across various pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45% wall-clock time while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: ES(WP) provides an effective plug-and-play solution for training acceleration, motivating further research into data efficiency for large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

TL;DR: GEMS is a scalable MARL framework that replaces explicit policy populations with latent anchors and a generator, using Monte Carlo rollouts and meta-dynamics to achieve faster computation and lower memory usage than PSRO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population-based MARL methods like PSRO have quadratic computation and linear memory costs due to storing explicit policy populations and constructing full payoff matrices, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses compact latent anchors and an amortized generator instead of explicit populations, with Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle for adaptive policy expansion. Best responses are trained within generator using advantage-based trust-region objective.

Result: GEMS achieves up to ~6x faster computation, 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while obtaining higher rewards in Two-player and Multi-Player games like Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker, and Multi-Particle environment.

Conclusion: GEMS retains PSRO's game theoretic guarantees while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, enabling scalable multi-agent learning across multiple domains.

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

*Rui Ai,Hugo De Oliveira Barbalho,Sirui Li,Alexei Robsky,David Simchi-Levi,Ishai Menache*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes POC framework for deciding when to re-solve MILP optimization problems in real-time operations, balancing performance and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time operations require frequent solving of computationally intensive MILPs, but re-solving too often is costly while not re-solving enough leads to suboptimal solutions. Existing methods focus on heuristics and smooth objectives, not NP-hard MILPs.

Method: Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC) framework that detects environmental changes and selects beneficial samples for solving MILPs, addressing challenges of solution optimality characterization and non-MDP structure.

Result: POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17% across eight synthetic and real-world datasets, establishing theoretical relationship between re-solves and cost.

Conclusion: POC provides systematic solution for re-solving decisions in real-time MILP operations and introduces valuable benchmarks for this understudied area.

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter is a lightweight transformation layer that bridges embedding spaces between model versions, enabling continued use of existing ANN indexes without full re-encoding of the corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the significant operational disruption and computational cost of re-encoding entire corpora and rebuilding ANN indexes when upgrading embedding models in production vector databases.

Method: Three adapter parameterizations (Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and compact Residual MLP) trained on small samples of paired old and new embeddings to map new queries into legacy embedding space.

Result: Recovers 95-99% of retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) compared to full re-embedding, adds less than 10 microseconds query latency, reduces recompute costs by over 100 times, and enables near-zero operational interruption upgrades.

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter provides a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment by enabling embedding model upgrades without the need for full corpus re-encoding and index rebuilding.

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods still have substantial memory overhead due to model activations, especially with large batch sizes and long context lengths. The authors observed that activation ranks remain consistently low, suggesting compression potential.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct) that compresses activations online during forward pass without calibration data. Uses a novel sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm for low-rank matrices with improved computational efficiency and tighter error bounds compared to RSVD.

Result: Reduces activation memory by approximately 80% compared to LoRA while maintaining competitive performance on both vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: LoRAct provides an effective memory-efficient fine-tuning approach that addresses the critical bottleneck of memory overhead in parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, enabling more practical deployment.

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Group-invariant neural networks show improved generalization for symmetric functions through a group-dependent factor in approximation rates, while estimation error remains unchanged.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical benefits of incorporating group-invariant structures in neural networks for learning symmetric functions.

Method: Analyze generalization error within the Barron framework, examining approximation rates with group-dependent factors and Rademacher complexity bounds.

Result: Group invariance improves approximation accuracy when δ_G,Γ,σ is small, while estimation error is unaffected. Examples show cases with δ_G,Γ,σ ≈ |G|^{-1} (favorable) and δ_G,Γ,σ ≈ 1 (unfavorable).

Conclusion: Encoding group-invariant structures in neural networks provides statistical advantages for symmetric target functions, with rigorous theoretical foundation.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

TL;DR: Parameter interpolation and extrapolation methods for temporal generalization fail to consistently outperform simply using the latest model parameters across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often perform poorly under distribution shifts, and this work investigates whether models can generalize to future data using only past data.

Method: Two approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (parameter interpolation) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull (parameter extrapolation), evaluated on temporal tasks including language modeling, news summarization, image classification, and more.

Result: None of the evaluated methods consistently outperformed the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters across all scenarios.

Conclusion: Without access to future data or strong assumptions about data-generating processes, generalizing to future data is inherently difficult, warranting caution about claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRIB proposes a direct prediction framework for multivariate time series forecasting with missing values, avoiding imputation errors by using Information Bottleneck principle with consistency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imputation-then-prediction approaches suffer from lack of ground truth for missing values, leading to imputation errors that degrade prediction accuracy. Imputation without supervision can corrupt data distribution.

Method: Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB) framework that directly predicts from partially observed time series using unified-variate attention mechanism and consistency regularization to filter noise while preserving predictive signals.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets show CRIB predicts accurately even under high missing rates, outperforming imputation-based approaches.

Conclusion: Direct prediction from partially observed time series without imputation is more effective than imputation-then-prediction frameworks for handling missing values in multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how optimizer choice affects model robustness under quantization, finding that Shampoo optimizer performs best for quantization-aware training and achieves highest parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited systematic evidence on how optimizer choice interacts with model quantization, despite both being important for efficient model deployment.

Method: Trained full-precision models with six optimizers, applied post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), analyzed outlier metrics and derived scaling laws.

Result: Outlier metrics fail to predict PTQ performance; Shampoo optimizer shows lowest accuracy degradation in QAT and highest parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice significantly impacts quantization robustness, with Shampoo performing best for quantization-aware training scenarios.

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

*Yijie Zhang,Yiyang Shen,Weiran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IDMVAE is a multimodal VAE that uses mutual information regularization and diffusion models to better disentangle shared and private information across modalities, improving generation quality and semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal generative models struggle with disentangling shared and private information when dealing with challenging datasets where likelihood models are insufficient.

Method: Proposes mutual information-based regularizations including cross-view mutual information maximization for shared variables and cycle-consistency loss for redundancy removal, combined with diffusion models for improved latent priors.

Result: IDMVAE achieves clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed components are complementary and effectively address the disentanglement problem in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

### [239] [Fusing Sequence Motifs and Pan-Genomic Features: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using an Explainable Lightweight 1D CNN-XGBoost Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23552)
*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Nowshin Tarannum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMR-EnsembleNet combines a lightweight 1D CNN for sequence motif learning with XGBoost for feature interactions to predict antimicrobial resistance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on E. coli datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AMR prediction methods either ignore sequence context of SNPs or require large datasets, creating limitations for moderately-sized genomic datasets in this domain.

Method: Ensemble framework combining custom 1D CNN for sequence-aware learning of SNP motifs with XGBoost for capturing complex feature interactions, trained on 809 E. coli strains across four antibiotics.

Result: Achieved MCC of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin and highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for Gentamicin, with model focusing on known AMR genes like fusA and parC.

Conclusion: Fusing sequence-aware 1D CNN with feature-based XGBoost creates a powerful ensemble that overcomes limitations of order-agnostic or standalone sequence models for AMR prediction.

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

### [240] [Improving constraint-based discovery with robust propagation and reliable LLM priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23570)
*Ruiqi Lyu,Alistair Turcan,Martin Jinye Zhang,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaCD is a causal discovery method that combines CI tests and LLM annotations to create high-confidence seed edges, then uses confidence-down propagation to build accurate causal graphs while filtering LLM hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional constraint-based methods like PC assume perfect CI tests and exhaustive search, which often fail in practice. LLMs can help but are prone to hallucinations, requiring careful filtering.

Method: Uses both CI tests and LLM annotations to create high-confidence seeds, filters hallucinations via shuffled queries exploiting positional bias, and applies confidence-down propagation strategy.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy in final graph construction across multiple real-world graphs compared to existing constraint-based methods.

Conclusion: MosaCD improves causal discovery by combining reliable seed generation from multiple sources with robust propagation strategies, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

*Emerald Zhang,Julian Weaver,Edward Castillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVO-LRP uses evolutionary optimization to tune LRP hyperparameters for better explainable AI, outperforming traditional methods in interpretability metrics and visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LRP implementations rely on heuristic rules that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior, creating a need for principled optimization of attribution methods.

Method: EVO-LRP applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics like faithfulness and sparseness.

Result: EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific features.

Conclusion: Attribution quality in explainable AI can be systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization rather than relying on heuristic rules.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKETCHLORD is a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank and diagonal components of linear operators, outperforming sequential approaches and providing high-fidelity approximations for large-scale operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many machine learning tasks involve high-dimensional linear operators that are costly to access via matrix-vector products. Existing sketched methods can construct either low-rank or diagonal approximations, but these suffer from approximation errors due to assumed simpler structure.

Method: SKETCHLORD casts the problem as a convex optimization that simultaneously estimates both low-rank and diagonal components, targeting Low-Rank plus Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. This leads to a scalable algorithm.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on synthetic LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's superior performance in accurately recovering these structures compared to sequential variants.

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD is a valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly for high-fidelity approximations of large-scale operators like deep learning Hessians.

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

### [243] [Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23592)
*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A holistic continual model merging framework that intervenes at pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging stages to address catastrophic forgetting without accessing old data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional continual learning approaches that either maintain growing task vectors (scalability issues) or rely solely on weight-space merging (losing functional information) when old data is inaccessible.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Pre-merging: fine-tune main model in tangent space for weight disentanglement; 2) During merging: leverage functional information from optimizer states; 3) Post-merging: correction to align representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting problem by combining weight-space and functional information through a three-stage intervention framework.

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

### [244] [Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593)
*Zekun Wang,Anant Gupta,Zihan Dong,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rank-1 EWC variant combined with replay effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting in diffusion models by leveraging their low-SNR gradient geometry where gradients become collinear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge in continual learning. Existing methods like replay and EWC have limitations: replay needs strong generators and suffers from drift, while EWC assumes shared optima and uses diagonal Fisher approximations.

Method: Proposes rank-1 EWC that captures dominant curvature direction as cheaply as diagonal EWC, paired with replay to encourage parameter sharing while mitigating drift. Leverages diffusion model gradient geometry in low-SNR regime.

Result: Consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting on class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k). Nearly eliminates forgetting on MNIST/FashionMNIST and halves it on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: Diffusion models have approximately rank-1 Fisher. With better Fisher estimation, EWC effectively complements replay by constraining drift while replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

*Zheng Wang,Kaixuan Zhang,Wanfang Chen,Xiaonan Lu,Longyuan Li,Tobias Schlagenhauf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies linear models for time series forecasting, focusing on characteristic roots' role in temporal dynamics and proposing methods to handle noise-induced spurious roots through rank reduction and adaptive null space learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show simple linear models can be surprisingly competitive in time series forecasting, warranting deeper theoretical investigation into their robustness and interpretability, particularly regarding characteristic roots in temporal dynamics.

Method: The paper analyzes characteristic roots in both noise-free and noisy regimes, then proposes two strategies: 1) rank reduction techniques (Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction) to recover latent dynamics, and 2) Root Purge, an adaptive method that learns a noise-suppressing null space during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate both approaches' effectiveness, validating theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of integrating classical linear systems theories with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphIFE addresses class imbalance in graph data by mitigating quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes using graph invariant learning and enhanced embedding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in graph-structured data causes biased learning and poor performance on minority classes, as most GNNs assume balanced distributions and don't handle this issue effectively.

Method: Proposes GraphIFE framework that incorporates graph invariant learning concepts and strategies to strengthen embedding space representation, improving identification of invariant features.

Result: Extensive experiments show GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets, demonstrating efficiency and robust generalization.

Conclusion: GraphIFE effectively mitigates quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes and enhances performance on imbalanced graph data through invariant feature extraction.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies information leakage issues in conventional inductive kriging evaluation and proposes a 3x3 partition method to eliminate leakage. It then introduces DRIK, a distribution-robust approach that enhances OOD generalization through node, edge, and subgraph-level strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional training-evaluation setups for inductive kriging suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution generalization due to test data influencing model selection through early stopping.

Method: Proposes a 3x3 partition to separate training, validation, and test sets cleanly, then introduces DRIK with three-tier strategy: perturbing node coordinates, dropping edges, and adding pseudo-labeled subgraphs.

Result: Experiments on six spatio-temporal datasets show DRIK consistently outperforms existing methods with up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed 3x3 partition eliminates information leakage and DRIK effectively enhances OOD generalization in inductive kriging, demonstrating superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading
overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heterogeneous graph models struggle to capture long-range information efficiently, requiring many layers that lead to high computational complexity and over-smoothing problems.

Method: Proposes Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN) that uses auxiliary virtual nodes connected to all nodes of specific types to facilitate enhanced information flow and efficient long-range information aggregation.

Result: VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only 4 layers and can be applied as a versatile framework to other HGNN models. Empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The virtual node approach provides an effective solution for capturing long-range dependencies in heterogeneous graphs while maintaining computational efficiency and avoiding over-smoothing issues.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in graph-structured data by identifying the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP) where model performance degrades due to random seeds, and proposes PNS (Pure Node Sampling) as a plug-and-play module to mitigate this issue during node synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance is prevalent in graph data but often overlooked by GNNs that assume class balance. The authors identified RACP - a problem where random seeds cause significant performance degradation in off-the-shelf models, necessitating a solution to eliminate random factor influences.

Method: Proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling), a plug-and-play module that operates during node synthesis to address RACP. Unlike specialized algorithms for quantity or topological imbalance, PNS directly mitigates the randomness problem and also alleviates performance degradation from abnormal neighbor distributions.

Result: Experimental results show PNS effectively eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds and outperforms baselines across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. The method demonstrates both effectiveness and stability.

Conclusion: PNS successfully addresses the RACP problem in class-imbalanced graph data by providing a stable solution that removes random seed influences while improving overall performance across multiple datasets and GNN architectures.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods (Platt scaling and isotonic regression) with convergence guarantees, complexity bounds, and investigation of feature informativeness impact on calibration performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of comprehensive theoretical understanding of post-hoc calibration methods and their performance across different datasets and model architectures, particularly regarding the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance.

Method: Rigorous theoretical analysis of Platt scaling and isotonic regression, derivation of convergence guarantees and computational complexity bounds, controlled synthetic experiments to explore feature informativeness impact, and empirical evaluation across diverse real-world datasets and model architectures.

Result: Consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios, fundamental insights into robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches under varying feature conditions (informative features vs. complete feature spaces with noise).

Conclusion: Practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines

### [252] [Beyond Greedy Exits: Improved Early Exit Decisions for Risk Control and Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23666)
*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UAT is an adaptive early-exit framework that uses Multi-Armed Bandit to dynamically adjust exit thresholds online, improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional early-exit methods use static thresholds that can be overconfident in wrong predictions and lack robustness to distribution shifts, undermining model trustworthiness.

Method: UAT employs a Multi-Armed Bandit framework with a novel reward function that assesses predictive certainty and reliability, enabling unsupervised online threshold adaptation.

Result: UAT achieves 1.70-2.10x speedup with less than 2% performance drop compared to full model performance across vision-language, text generation, and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed UAT framework effectively balances computational efficiency and prediction quality through adaptive threshold adjustment, providing guarantees on risk while being robust to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

### [253] [Why Alignment Must Precede Distillation: A Minimal Working Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23667)
*Sungmin Cha,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that the common practice of distilling models before alignment (KD -> Align) limits alignment effectiveness, particularly for rare behaviors. Instead, aligning before distillation (Align -> KD) produces better results by preserving distributional recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference alignment practices on knowledge-distilled models overlook the importance of the reference model's distributional recall, which limits alignment of rare but desirable behaviors even with strong preference signals.

Method: 1) Theoretical explanation of how reference models constrain alignment objectives; 2) Controlled Mixture-of-Gaussians experiment to validate the theory; 3) LLM alignment experiments with SmolLM2 family comparing KD->Align vs Align->KD pipelines.

Result: Models aligned after KD fail to effectively align target behaviors, showing substantially lower reward and target precision. The proposed Align->KD pipeline robustly aligns behaviors, yielding superior target-oriented metrics and lower variance.

Conclusion: Reference-model recall is a first-order design choice in alignment, establishing the principle that alignment must precede distillation for optimal performance.

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hermes framework improves stock time series forecasting by better capturing industry correlations through hyperedge-based moving aggregation for lead-lag relationships and multi-scale fusion for cross-scale information integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock time series exhibit industry correlation that can improve forecasting accuracy, but existing hypergraph methods capture this correlation superficially without considering inter-industry lead-lag interactions and multi-scale information.

Method: Hermes integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. It uses hyperedge-based moving aggregation with sliding windows and dynamic temporal operations for lead-lag relationships, and cross-scale message passing for multi-scale information integration.

Result: Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The Hermes framework successfully addresses limitations in existing methods by better exploiting industry correlation through improved lead-lag relationship modeling and multi-scale information integration, leading to superior forecasting performance.

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIMIGNN is a GNN-based method for multivariate time series forecasting that addresses redundant neighbor aggregation and single-scale prediction limitations through diversity-aware neighbor selection and dynamic multi-scale fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based MTS forecasting methods often overlook neighbor diversity, leading to redundant information aggregation, and rely solely on single temporal scale representations for final predictions.

Method: Proposes DIMIGNN with two key components: Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure high informational similarity with neighbors while maintaining diversity, and Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) to dynamically adjust contributions from different temporal scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DIMIGNN effectively addresses limitations in existing GNN-based MTS forecasting by incorporating diversity-aware neighbor selection and dynamic multi-scale fusion, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

### [256] [Towards a Comprehensive Scaling Law of Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23678)
*Guoliang Zhao,Yuhan Fu,Shuaipeng Li,Xingwu Sun,Ruobing Xie,An Wang,Weidong Han,Zhen Yang,Weixuan Sun,Yudong Zhang,Cheng-zhong Xu,Di Wang,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes comprehensive scaling laws for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by systematically analyzing five key factors (data size, total model size, activated model size, number of active experts, and shared expert ratio) through 446 controlled experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws for dense models don't apply to MoE models due to multiple influencing factors, their complex coupling relationships, and non-monotonic performance impacts, requiring fine-grained investigation of MoE-specific scaling laws.

Method: Systematic decomposition of MoE settings into five key factors, conducting 446 controlled experiments to characterize marginal effects and construct a comprehensive joint MoE scaling law that considers all essential factors.

Result: Optimal settings for number of active experts (G) and shared expert ratio (S) are independent of model architecture and data size. As total model size (N) scales, the optimal activation parameter ratio (Na/N) becomes sparser.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE scaling law provides accurate and insightful guidance for future MoE model design and training, addressing the unique challenges of scaling MoE architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

*Danni Yang,Zhikang Chen,Sen Cui,Mengyue Yang,Ding Li,Abudukelimu Wuerkaixi,Haoxuan Li,Jinke Ren,Mingming Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for federated continual learning that forms adaptive coalitions to address catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated continual learning approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting due to temporal and cross-client shifts, and global model aggregation introduces interference in heterogeneous scenarios.

Method: Proposes dynamic cooperative learning coalitions where clients selectively ally based on gradient coherence and model similarity, using coalitional affinity games and merge-blocking algorithms to achieve equilibrium.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show superior performance compared to various baselines, demonstrating effective knowledge retention and adaptation in evolving data distributions.

Conclusion: The decentralized dynamic cooperation framework successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning by enabling personalized models through adaptive client coalitions.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

*Tanya Chowdhury,Atharva Nijasure,Yair Zick,James Allan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A mechanistic interpretability framework using coalitional game theory to identify stable neuron groups (coalitions) in LLM MLP layers, revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features beyond individual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuned LLMs encode rich task-specific features in MLP layers, but the structure and cooperation patterns of neurons remain unclear. Prior work shows statistical priors change across layers, requiring study of neuron interactions rather than isolated analysis.

Method: Use coalitional game theory where neurons are agents in hedonic games with preferences based on synergistic contributions. Apply top-responsive utilities and PAC-Top-Cover algorithm to extract stable neuron coalitions and track their transitions across layers.

Result: Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers, the method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than clustering baselines, revealing functionally important and interpretable computational units.

Conclusion: Hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure in LLM representations, providing interpretable neuron groups that are predictive across domains and go beyond traditional disentanglement approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

*Soroosh Safari Loaliyan,Jose-Luis Ambite,Paul M. Thompson,Neda Jahanshad,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a federated domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) with proximal regularization to address scanner-induced domain shift in medical imaging while preserving privacy constraints of federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is suitable for medical imaging due to privacy constraints, but scanner-induced domain shift causes models to fail on external sites. Existing harmonization methods violate privacy by comparing data across sites, while standard Domain Generalization assumes centralized data access.

Method: Integration of Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) within FL process with proximal regularization to stabilize adversarial training among clients when naive federated DANN fails to converge.

Result: Experiments on T1-weighted 3-D brain MRIs from OpenBHB dataset show superior cross-site generalization over FedAvg and ERM when training on 15 sites and testing on 19 unseen sites, while preserving data privacy.

Conclusion: The proposed federated DANN with proximal regularization effectively addresses domain shift in medical imaging under FL constraints, achieving better generalization than baseline methods while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

*Ankit Gangwal,Aaryan Ajay Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model Merging (MM) increases vulnerability to transfer attacks rather than providing free adversarial robustness, with over 95% relative transfer attack success rate across comprehensive evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of Model Merging on the transferability of adversarial examples, challenging the prevailing notion that MM provides free adversarial robustness.

Method: Comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis using 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods across 336 distinct attack settings.

Result: MM cannot reliably defend against transfer attacks; stronger MM methods increase vulnerability, mitigating representation bias increases vulnerability, and weight averaging is the most vulnerable method.

Conclusion: Model Merging increases vulnerability to transfer attacks, and findings provide critical insights for designing more secure systems employing MM with potential solutions to the problem.

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

TL;DR: TimeTic is a transferability estimation framework that uses in-context learning to predict TSFM performance after fine-tuning on target datasets, achieving 30% improvement over zero-shot baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing number of time series foundation models, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes challenging, especially in domains with limited public data.

Method: Recasts model selection as in-context-learning problem using tabular foundation models, organizes model-data relationships as contextual information, and introduces novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across layers.

Result: Achieves mean rank correlation of ~0.6 with actual fine-tuned performance, 30% improvement over using zero-shot performance as transferability score on benchmark with 10 datasets, 10 models, and 3 tasks.

Conclusion: TimeTic provides effective transferability estimation for TSFMs, enabling better model selection for fine-tuning through in-context learning and novel model characterization techniques.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world RL applications are continuous and complex, but existing discrete-time algorithms are sensitive to time discretization, leading to poor stability and slow convergence in continuous-time settings.

Method: Derived a continuous-time policy gradient formula using an analogue of the advantage function and established its martingale characterization, leading to the proposed CT-DDPG algorithm for stable deterministic policy learning in continuous-time environments.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that CT-DDPG provides improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods across various control tasks with different time discretizations and noise levels.

Conclusion: The proposed CT-DDPG algorithm successfully extends deterministic policy gradient methods to continuous-time RL, overcoming time discretization sensitivity issues and achieving superior performance in continuous environments.

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world banking fraud detection requires models that can handle both event order and irregular time gaps between transactions, which existing methods may not adequately capture.

Method: Augments GPT-style architecture with dedicated time encoder (for absolute timestamps or inter-event values) and learned positional encoder to preserve relative order of events.

Result: Outperforms four classical baselines (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM) and transformer ablations without time or positional components, achieving highest AUROC and PRAUC on test set.

Conclusion: FraudTransformer effectively captures temporal patterns in payment streams and demonstrates superior fraud detection performance compared to traditional methods and simplified transformer variants.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that
can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them.
We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla
GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either
absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional
encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial
dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

TL;DR: SAFDNet is a novel deep learning model that combines frequency domain analysis with adaptive noise filtering to provide early warnings for intraoperative hypotension, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with serious postoperative complications including delirium and mortality, but existing AI prediction models have limitations in handling both time and frequency domain information, capturing dependencies, and dealing with noise in biosignal data.

Method: Proposed SAFDNet with two key components: (1) adaptive spectral block using Fourier analysis for frequency-domain feature extraction with self-adaptive thresholding for noise mitigation, and (2) interactive attention block to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data.

Result: Extensive validation on two large-scale real-world datasets shows SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3% AUROC in IOH early warning, outperforming state-of-the-art models. The model also demonstrates robust predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise.

Conclusion: SAFDNet is well-suited for practical clinical applications due to its superior performance, robustness, and noise resistance, making it a promising tool for early IOH prediction to improve perioperative care outcomes.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle clustering tasks for large-scale datasets efficiently while reducing computational overhead.

Method: Uses granular-ball technique with multi-sampling to construct multi-grained granular-balls that progressively uncover a statistical "skeleton" - a spatial abstraction approximating data structure and distribution.

Result: Achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with 100 million instances across 256 dimensions, while dramatically reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: GBSK provides an effective solution for large-scale clustering with high efficiency and accuracy, with AGBSK offering simplified parameter settings for real-world deployment.

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

*Ting-Kang Wang,Chih-Pin Tan,Yi-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) for symbolic music generation that balances efficiency and quality by expanding compound tokens across decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and quality - fine-grained tokenizations provide strong coherence but have high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency but struggle with intra-token dependencies.

Method: Adapt a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies while preserving efficiency. This is a lightweight strategy with no additional parameters that integrates seamlessly into existing representations.

Result: Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show that the method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Conclusion: The delay-based scheduling mechanism successfully addresses the efficiency-quality trade-off in symbolic music generation by enabling effective modeling of intra-token dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

*Li Wang,Sudun,Xingjian Zhang,Wenjun Wu,Lei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Batch Normalization (BN) can be effectively used in deep reinforcement learning despite non-i.i.d. data challenges, with proposed Mode-Aware BN (MA-BN) method improving training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BN has been underutilized in DRL due to non-i.i.d. data and shifting distributions, but it retains unique advantages for improving training stability and optimization in RL settings.

Method: Conducted empirical study on BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, analyzed training/evaluation modes, identified failure modes, and proposed Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) with practical recommendations.

Result: MA-BN accelerates and stabilizes training, broadens effective learning rate range, enhances exploration, and reduces optimization difficulty in RL settings.

Conclusion: BN can be effectively integrated into DRL pipelines when applied appropriately, with MA-BN providing robust implementation that adapts to evolving data distributions and improves convergence.

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) bridges SFT and RL but suffers from instability due to distributional drift. Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT) adds KL regularization to DFT, achieving better performance across reasoning tasks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between SFT (efficient but memorizing) and RL (generalizable but expensive), and to fix DFT's instability issues while maintaining its benefits.

Method: Analyzed DFT through reward-weighted regression framework, identified distributional drift problem, and proposed ASFT which adds lightweight KL regularization to DFT's reweighting mechanism.

Result: ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation tasks with substantial improvements.

Conclusion: The RWR framework provides systematic understanding of post-training methods, showing that principled theoretical analysis leads to stronger guarantees and practical performance gains.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAPoint is a task-agnostic framework that combines gradient boosted trees' predictive power with interpretable point-based risk scores for clinical decision support, handling classification, regression, and survival tasks with superior flexibility and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clinical risk score methods suffer from manual preprocessing, task-specific limitations, and simplified assumptions that restrict their flexibility and predictive accuracy.

Method: SHAPoint integrates gradient boosted trees with point-based risk scores, supporting multiple task types while inheriting tree-based model advantages like native missing data handling and monotonic constraint support.

Result: SHAPoint produces compact, interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods but at significantly faster runtime, requiring less manual preprocessing.

Conclusion: SHAPoint is a powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification that balances predictive accuracy with interpretability across diverse clinical tasks.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit knowledge homophily where related entities have similar knowledge levels. A GNN model predicts entity knowledgeability scores to prioritize checking less-known triplets, improving active labeling efficiency and multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural organization of knowledge in LLMs and leverage cognitive neuroscience principles like semantic clustering to improve knowledge-intensive applications.

Method: Map LLM knowledge into graphs, analyze knowledge homophily patterns, and develop a GNN regression model to predict entity-level knowledgeability scores for prioritizing triplets.

Result: The approach improves active labeling efficiency for knowledge injection into LLMs and enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.

Conclusion: Knowledge homophily in LLMs can be effectively leveraged through graph-based methods to optimize knowledge coverage and improve downstream applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

*Jiarui Jiang,Wei Huang,Miao Zhang,Taiji Suzuki,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba state-space models show competitive in-context learning capabilities with Transformers, but lack theoretical understanding. This paper analyzes Mamba's training dynamics on linear regression ICL, establishing exponential convergence and revealing it performs online gradient descent rather than gradient descent emulation like Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models like Mamba have shown empirical in-context learning capabilities comparable to Transformers, but theoretical understanding of their ICL mechanisms remains limited, hindering deeper insights into their underlying operations.

Method: Developed novel techniques for non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's structure, analyzing training dynamics on linear regression ICL task as a theoretical benchmark.

Result: Established exponential convergence rate to ICL solution and derived loss bound comparable to Transformer's. Revealed that Mamba performs a variant of online gradient descent to learn latent functions in context, different from Transformer's gradient descent emulation mechanism.

Conclusion: Mamba achieves in-context learning through online gradient descent rather than gradient descent emulation, providing theoretical foundation for understanding its ICL capabilities and distinguishing its mechanism from Transformers.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

*Chunxue Xu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Bryan Hooi,Songze Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of Visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) robustness against image perturbations, revealing that while Visual CoT improves accuracy, it increases sensitivity to noise. The authors identify edited image patches as the main vulnerability and propose a Grounding DINO-based solution to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual CoT techniques enhance multimodal reasoning but their robustness against image-level noise remains unexplored. The authors aim to systematically evaluate Visual CoT's vulnerability to visual perturbations.

Method: Created a benchmark with 12 image corruption types across 4 VQA datasets to compare Visual CoT VLMs with standard VLMs. Proposed a plug-and-play robustness enhancement method using Grounding DINO to provide stable visual cues.

Result: Visual CoT improves absolute accuracy on both clean and corrupted images but shows greater sensitivity to perturbations, with sharper performance degradation. Edited image patches were identified as the primary source of fragility.

Conclusion: Visual CoT has clear fragility patterns but the proposed Grounding DINO integration effectively enhances robustness in an architecture-agnostic manner, providing a practical solution for stabilizing visual reasoning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE-RSV refines steering vectors for LLM control using sparse autoencoders to denoise and augment vectors from small datasets, outperforming baselines including supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steering methods require large datasets to learn behavioral information, limiting real-world applicability. Steering vectors from small datasets contain task-irrelevant noise that reduces effectiveness.

Method: Leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to semantically denoise and augment steering vectors by removing task-irrelevant features and enriching missing task-relevant features through semantic similarity.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Effective steering vectors can be constructed from limited training data by refining original vectors through SAEs.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

*Yao Luan,Ni Mu,Yiqin Yang,Bo Xu,Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAIR addresses stage misalignment in preference-based RL for multi-stage tasks by learning stage approximations using temporal distance and prioritizing same-stage comparisons, improving policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based RL struggles with multi-stage tasks due to stage misalignment - comparing segments from different stages (e.g., navigation vs manipulation) provides uninformative feedback that hinders learning.

Method: STAIR learns stage approximations using temporal distance via contrastive learning, grouping temporally close states into coherent stages without predefined task knowledge, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage.

Result: Extensive experiments show STAIR's superiority in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks. Human studies confirm that STAIR's approximated stages align with human cognition.

Conclusion: STAIR effectively mitigates stage misalignment in preference-based RL for multi-stage tasks through dynamic stage approximation and same-stage comparison prioritization.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

*Fanding Huang,Guanbo Huang,Xiao Fan,Yi He,Xiao Liang,Xiao Chen,Qinting Jiang,Faisal Nadeem Khan,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the traditional exploration-exploitation trade-off view in RLVR, showing it's an artifact of measurement level rather than a fundamental constraint. By analyzing hidden-state space using Effective Rank metrics, the authors demonstrate exploration and exploitation can be decoupled and enhanced simultaneously through their VERL method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-examine the prevailing exploration-exploitation trade-off perspective in RLVR, which the authors argue may be an artifact of token-level metrics rather than a fundamental constraint.

Method: Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL) - shifts analysis to hidden-state space using Effective Rank (ER) and its derivatives (ERV and ERA) to quantify exploration/exploitation dynamics, and directly shapes the RL advantage function using ERA as a predictive meta-controller.

Result: Experiments show consistent gains across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Conclusion: Exploration and exploitation can be decoupled at the hidden-state level, enabling simultaneous enhancement of both capacities through the VERL method, which creates a synergistic dual-channel incentive structure instead of forcing a trade-off.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

### [276] [Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23809)
*Hong Huang,Decheng Wu,Rui Cen,Guanghua Yu,Zonghang Li,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Peng Chen,Xue Liu,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tequila is a ternary weight quantization method that addresses deadzone trapping by repurposing trapped weights as dynamic biases, achieving near full-precision performance with 3.0x inference speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ternary quantization methods suffer from significant accuracy degradation due to deadzone trapping, where weights get stuck at boundaries and receive uninformative gradients, limiting model capacity and optimization.

Method: Proposes Tequila which reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by converting them into dynamic biases, allowing continuous forward signals and meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation with nearly zero inference overhead.

Result: Outperforms SOTA ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks, achieving >4% accuracy gain on ARC benchmark and nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with 3.0x inference speedup.

Conclusion: Tequila provides a highly practical and efficient solution for deploying advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments by effectively solving the deadzone trapping problem in ternary quantization.

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IndexNet is an MLP-based framework for multivariate time series forecasting that incorporates timestamp and variable index embeddings to capture long-term periodic patterns and distinguish between heterogeneous variables, achieving comparable performance to mainstream baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MTSF methods overlook index-related descriptive information like timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics that could improve forecasting accuracy.

Method: Proposes IndexNet with Index Embedding module containing Timestamp Embedding (transforms timestamps into vectors) and Channel Embedding (assigns unique identity embeddings to variables based on indices). Uses MLP-based architecture for lightweight periodic pattern capture.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets show IndexNet achieves comparable performance to mainstream baselines, with strong generality and interpretability.

Conclusion: IndexNet effectively leverages temporal and variable-aware design through index embeddings, demonstrating the importance of incorporating descriptive index information in MTSF while maintaining lightweight MLP architecture advantages.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

TL;DR: DyGEval is a novel framework for evaluating Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) on unseen test graphs by estimating their performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DGNNs face performance uncertainty when deployed on unseen dynamic graphs due to evolving data distributions over time, making evaluation crucial for practical deployment.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation that captures training-test distribution differences as supervision, and (2) DyGEval development and training to estimate DGNN performance on test graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments show DyGEval effectively assesses various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: DyGEval provides a reliable evaluation method for DGNNs on unseen dynamic graphs, addressing the critical need for performance assessment during test-time deployment.

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

*Omri Puny,Yaron Lipman,Benjamin Kurt Miller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Space Group Conditional Flow Matching is a novel generative framework that samples highly-symmetric, stable crystals by conditioning on space groups and Wyckoff positions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most generative models overlook crystallographic symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistic crystal structures with limited symmetry. There's a need for models that properly incorporate space group symmetry and Wyckoff position constraints.

Method: The framework conditions the entire generation process on given space groups and Wyckoff positions. It uses a conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and group-conditioned, equivariant vector field that restricts atom motion to their initial Wyckoff positions. It employs an efficient group averaging reformulation for symmetric crystals.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks, with significantly reduced computational overhead for symmetrization.

Conclusion: Space Group Conditional Flow Matching successfully generates highly-symmetric, stable crystals by properly incorporating crystallographic constraints, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

*Alexander Kolesov,Stepan Manukhov,Vladimir V. Palyulin,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECD²G is a novel discrete data generation method that uses electrical circuit analogies to model probability flow between distributions, with neural networks learning current flows for provable distribution transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theoretically grounded method for discrete data generation that guarantees distribution transfer using principles from electrical engineering.

Method: Analogy between electric current flow and probability mass transfer; neural network learns electric currents representing probability flow; samples transported along circuit pathways according to learned currents.

Result: Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in transferring between data distributions.

Conclusion: ECD²G provides a theoretically sound approach for discrete data generation with provable guarantees for distribution transfer, bridging electrical engineering concepts with machine learning.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

### [281] [Bayesian Mixture-of-Experts: Towards Making LLMs Know What They Don't Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23830)
*Albus Yizhuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian MoE routing framework that models uncertainty in routing decisions to address brittleness in standard deterministic routing, improving model calibration and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deterministic routing in Mixture-of-Experts models causes brittleness, leading to model miscalibration and overconfidence - systems that don't know what they don't know.

Method: A Bayesian MoE routing framework that models probability distributions over routing decisions, investigating three approaches: weight-space, logit-space, and selection-space uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE model show significant improvements in routing stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical pathway to build more robust and self-aware LLMs by creating reliable internal uncertainty signals, helping models know what they don't know.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

TL;DR: AD-RRL uses diffusion models to train robust RL policies by generating worst-case trajectories during training, optimizing CVaR for better robustness to environment uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties in reinforcement learning, leveraging diffusion models' ability to generate full trajectories and mitigate compounding errors.

Method: Introduces Adversarial Diffusion for Robust RL (AD-RRL) that uses conditional sampling in diffusion models to generate worst-case trajectories, building on CVaR optimization for robust RL.

Result: Empirical results across standard benchmarks show AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with conditional sampling for worst-case trajectory generation effectively optimize CVaR and provide superior robustness in RL.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART is a decoupled RL training framework for GUI agents that addresses slow interactions and insufficient data through asynchronous modules and adaptive data curation, achieving significant performance improvements on OSWorld benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM-based GUI agents face challenges in RL training: slow multi-turn interactions with GUI environments and insufficient high-quality agent-environment interactions for effective policy learning.

Method: Proposes DART framework with four asynchronous modules (environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, trainer) enabling non-blocking communication, and introduces adaptive data curation including pre-collecting successful trajectories, dynamic adjustment of rollout parameters, selective training on high-entropy steps, and truncated importance sampling.

Result: Achieves 1.6× GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9× training throughput, and 5.5× environment utilization. On OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves 42.13% task success rate, 14.61% absolute gain over base model, and 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA.

Conclusion: DART significantly improves RL training efficiency and effectiveness for GUI agents through decoupled architecture and adaptive data curation, with plans to fully open-source the framework, data, and model checkpoints.

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [284] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models can transfer hidden biases to students through subliminal learning during distillation, even with hard distillation where only sampled tokens are used. This occurs via divergence tokens - rare cases where teachers with different biases predict different tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how subliminal learning occurs during language model distillation, particularly why it happens even under hard distillation where only sampled tokens are visible to the student.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis to identify the mechanisms behind subliminal learning, focusing on divergence tokens and layer-level analysis.

Result: Subliminal learning doesn't require global token entanglement or logit leakage. It occurs through divergence tokens, and masking these tokens mostly removes hidden bias transfer. Early layers are critical, and finetuning even a single early layer is sufficient for subliminal learning.

Conclusion: Subliminal learning is fragile and can be suppressed by small changes like paraphrasing prompts. The mechanism relies on divergence tokens rather than complex entanglement, with early layers playing a crucial role.

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

*Yash Jakhmola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified proof for linear convergence of gradient flow in neural networks with piecewise polynomial or ReLU/sigmoid activations, covering previously unknown architectures and consolidating existing results under weaker assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the success of gradient-based optimization in training complex deep neural networks and provide a unified theoretical framework for linear convergence across various architectures.

Method: Developed a general theorem proving linear convergence of continuous gradient descent (gradient flow) for neural networks with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or ReLU/sigmoid activations, focusing on the infinitesimal step size limit.

Result: The unified proof covers architectures previously without convergence guarantees and consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions, with empirical agreement between theoretical predictions and practical gradient descent performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding gradient-based optimization convergence in deep learning, bridging theory and practice across diverse neural network architectures.

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

TL;DR: DOC fine-tuning addresses catastrophic forgetting in LLM continual learning by tracking functional direction drift and making new task gradients orthogonal to historical directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in LLM continual learning, where models lose performance on old tasks when fine-tuned on new data without access to past datasets.

Method: Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning that tracks functional direction drift and adjusts new task gradients to be orthogonal to historical directions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on various LLM continual learning benchmarks, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: DOC provides a robust tool for continuous LLM fine-tuning by mitigating interference between new and old tasks through orthogonal gradient adjustment.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

*Chris Kolb,Laetitia Frost,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Gating is a differentiable structured overparameterization method that achieves group sparsity in neural networks without requiring specialized optimizers or post-hoc pruning, with theoretical guarantees of equivalence to L2,2/D regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured sparsity regularization is principled for network compression but non-differentiable, breaking compatibility with standard SGD and requiring specialized optimizers or post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees.

Method: Proposes D-Gating, which splits each weight group into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating factors, creating a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that converges to L2,2/D-regularized loss.

Result: Theoretical proof that local minima under D-Gating are also local minima under non-smooth structured L2,2/D penalization, with exponential convergence to the regularized loss. Validated across vision, language, and tabular tasks with strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs.

Conclusion: D-Gating provides theoretical equivalence to solving original group sparsity problems while enabling differentiable optimization, outperforming both direct structured penalty optimization and conventional pruning methods.

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

TL;DR: Proposes an integrated communication-control co-design mechanism using multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize energy efficiency and fairness in UAV swarm-assisted communications in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV swarm communications face reliability issues in complex geographic environments due to unpredictable wireless channels, requiring solutions that balance energy efficiency with equitable service for ground users.

Method: Formulates joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control as MDP, develops MARL framework with novel MAHPPO-AM algorithm using action masking for hybrid action spaces.

Result: Achieves 0.99 fairness index while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated approach effectively addresses the trade-off between communication fairness and energy efficiency in UAV swarm networks operating in challenging environments.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: GMAN provides a flexible, interpretable framework that delivers actionable, domain-aligned explanations while achieving competitive performance on real-world time-series learning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed

users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,

*Zhinan Xie,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS accelerates VLM inference by hiding visual tokens from the drafter during speculative decoding, using explicit-implicit input decomposition to reduce sequence length while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding faces challenges in VLMs due to visual token misalignment between drafter and target models, and slow self-attention from large numbers of visual tokens.

Method: Explicit-implicit input decomposition removes visual tokens from drafter input, reuses target VLM's hidden states as implicit visual information, and uses multi-step self-feedback training with dynamic data selection.

Result: Reduces drafter prefill sequence length to 0.7%-1.3% of target VLM input while maintaining lossless generation quality, achieving up to 2.65x speedup across diverse models and tasks.

Conclusion: HiViS effectively accelerates VLM inference through visual token hiding and explicit-implicit decomposition, demonstrating significant speed improvements without quality degradation.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the internal mechanisms of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures using an internal metric called MUI, revealing insights about neuron utilization, training dynamics, expert collaboration, and activation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE research is performance-centric with limited understanding of internal mechanisms, constraining broader progress in the field.

Method: Used an internal metric (MUI) to investigate MoE mechanisms by explicitly incorporating routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors across a wide range of publicly available MoE models.

Result: Found that: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, indicating stronger generalization; (2) training shows dynamic trajectories where MUI reveals deeper insights than benchmark performance alone; (3) task completion involves collaborative contributions from multiple experts with shared experts driving concentration; (4) neuron-level activation patterns serve as fine-grained proxies for data diversity.

Conclusion: MUI serves as a valuable complementary indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into MoE model capacity, dynamics, and specialization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

TL;DR: The paper connects diffusion models to the Kelly criterion for betting returns, showing that conditional diffusion models store mutual information between signals and conditioning. Classifier-free guidance boosts this mutual information, which is particularly useful for image models where image-label mutual information is low. The paper also refines the view of diffusion models as infinitely deep autoencoders and relates denoising loss to quantum mechanics' Fermi Golden Rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish connections between diffusion models and mathematical frameworks from betting theory (Kelly criterion) and quantum mechanics (Fermi Golden Rule), and to better understand how conditional diffusion models handle mutual information between signals and conditioning information.

Method: Theoretical analysis connecting diffusion models to the Kelly criterion, examining how conditional diffusion models store mutual information between X and Y, and analyzing classifier-free guidance mechanisms. Also relates denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.

Result: Found that conditional diffusion models store additional information equal to the mutual information between signal X and conditioning Y. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts this mutual information during sampling, which is particularly beneficial for image models due to low image-label mutual information.

Conclusion: The paper provides new theoretical insights connecting diffusion models to established mathematical frameworks, showing how classifier-free guidance enhances mutual information and offering refined perspectives on diffusion models as infinitely deep autoencoders with connections to quantum mechanics principles.

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

TL;DR: CorText integrates neural activity into LLM latent space for natural language interaction with brain data, enabling image captioning and question answering from fMRI data with zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural decoding methods are static and non-interactive, lacking the ability for open-ended natural language interaction with brain data.

Method: Integrates neural activity directly into LLM latent space, trained on fMRI data from natural scene viewing, enabling counterfactual analysis and in-silico cortical microstimulation.

Result: Generates accurate image captions and answers detailed questions better than controls using only neural data, achieves zero-shot generalization beyond training categories.

Conclusion: Marks a shift from passive decoding to generative, flexible brain-language interfaces, enabling interactive neural data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

*Kaisen Yang,Lixuan He,Rushi Shah,Kaicheng Yang,Qinwei Ma,Dianbo Liu,Alex Lamb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E²C is a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into exploration (generating high-level plans) and execution (carrying out plans), achieving higher efficiency and accuracy with fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought methods conflate planning and execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration, and reduced interpretability.

Method: Two-phase framework: exploratory phase generates high-level plans stochastically, execution phase deterministically carries out plans. Uses two-stage training with SFT (enforcing plan adherence) and RL (reinforcing execution determinism).

Result: Achieves 58.1% accuracy on AIME'2024 using <10% of decoding tokens compared to Forest-of-Thought. EF-SFT fine-tuning uses only 3.5% of tokens but yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy on medical benchmarks.

Conclusion: E²C provides state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution, while sharply reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

*Surya Murthy,Kushagra Gupta,Mustafa O. Karabag,David Fridovich-Keil,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiBS-MTL is a multitask learning method that uses direction-based bargaining to achieve Pareto stationary solutions immune to task domination, maintaining robustness to nonaffine task loss scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTL methods suffer from task domination when task losses are arbitrarily scaled, degrading overall performance. DiBS provides theoretical immunity to such scaling but lacks convergence analysis in nonconvex settings.

Method: Proposed DiBS-MTL, a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS for MTL. Proved convergence of DiBS iterates to Pareto stationary points under standard assumptions for nonconvex task losses.

Result: DiBS-MTL achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on standard MTL benchmarks while maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that degrade existing approaches.

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL provides a theoretically grounded and empirically validated solution to task domination in MTL, with proven convergence properties and practical computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

### [297] [Evaluating the Robustness of Chinchilla Compute-Optimal Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23963)
*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper validates Chinchilla's compute-optimal scaling principles despite identified ambiguities in model parameter interpretations, showing that key results remain robust under various parameter perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about Chinchilla's scaling laws - including wide confidence intervals, methodological discrepancies, and inconsistencies with other scaling laws - and determine whether practitioners can still rely on its prescriptions for language model scaling.

Method: Analyzed three possible interpretations of Chinchilla's model parameters, then systematically perturbed parameters in four structured ways to test robustness of key results, particularly focusing on the tokens-to-parameter ratio.

Result: Found that different parameter interpretations (with up to 15.2% differences) don't meaningfully affect scaling law estimates or compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Under one interpretation, the ratio becomes more constant with compute budget. Key results withstand substantial parameter perturbations.

Conclusion: Chinchilla's compute-optimal scaling principles remain valid and reliable for guiding language model scaling, providing renewed confidence in its prescriptions despite identified ambiguities.

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

*Dang Huu-Tien,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes model-agnostic error detection and rectification using penultimate layer features, leveraging feature similarity to identify mislabeled data points and automatically correct them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in datasets damages neural network performance, and there's growing demand for automated error detection tools as networks grow larger.

Method: Uses penultimate layer features to detect mislabeled data by comparing feature similarity - mislabeled points show higher similarity to their true class than other classes, using label occurrence probability within similar clusters.

Result: Extensive experiments show high performance across various noise types and successful automatic error rectification that improves dataset quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively detects and rectifies label errors using penultimate features, enhancing dataset quality for neural network training.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

*Maruf Ahmed Mridul,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL framework generates gas-optimized Solidity smart contracts from CDM specifications, achieving up to 35.59% gas savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contract automation offers efficiency gains but faces challenges in translating financial specs to gas-efficient code, particularly from high-level specifications like CDM.

Method: Uses PPO agent to select optimal code snippets from pre-defined library, with two-phase curriculum: first functional correctness training, then gas optimization.

Result: RL agent generates contracts with significant gas savings - up to 35.59% cost reduction on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines.

Conclusion: Presents viable methodology for automated synthesis of reliable and economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging gap between financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

TL;DR: GUIDE is a causal discovery framework that uses LLM-generated adjacency matrices with observational data via dual-encoder architecture, achieving significant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy while scaling to large node counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional causal discovery methods in scalability, computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, particularly beyond 70 nodes where existing methods fail.

Method: Integrates LLM-generated adjacency matrices with observational data through dual-encoder architecture, using reinforcement learning to balance accuracy and DAG constraints.

Result: Reduces runtime by ≈42% compared to RL-BIC and KCRL, achieves ≈117% accuracy improvement over NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually, and scales to ≥70 nodes where baselines fail.

Conclusion: GUIDE provides a scalable and efficient solution for causal discovery that overcomes limitations of traditional methods, particularly for large-scale problems with mixed data types.

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

### [301] [Does Weak-to-strong Generalization Happen under Spurious Correlations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24005)
*Chenruo Liu,Yijun Dong,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization when fine-tuning strong students with weak teachers' pseudolabels on tasks with spurious correlations from group imbalance. It identifies conditions where W2S fails and proposes an effective remedy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why weak-to-strong generalization fails in the presence of spurious correlations from group-imbalanced data, and to develop methods to improve W2S performance upon failures.

Method: Theoretical analysis of W2S gain at proportional asymptotic limit, extensive experiments on spurious correlation benchmarks, and a proposed algorithm that retrains the strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning.

Result: W2S always succeeds with sufficient pseudolabels when labeled and unlabeled minority group fractions are equal (η_u = η_ℓ), but fails when they differ, with W2S gain diminishing as (η_u - η_ℓ)² increases. The proposed algorithm consistently improves over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Group imbalance between labeled and unlabeled data can cause W2S generalization failures, but these can be effectively addressed through retraining on high-confidence data subsets without requiring group labels.

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention) accelerates DiT models by fusing sparse and linear attention, reducing attention computation by 95% and achieving 20x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention latency is a major bottleneck in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models for video generation due to quadratic complexity with long sequences.

Method: SLA classifies attention weights into critical (O(N²) attention), marginal (O(N) linear attention), and negligible (skipped) categories, combining them in a single GPU kernel.

Result: SLA reduces attention computation by 95%, achieves 13.7x speedup in attention computation and 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B without quality degradation.

Conclusion: SLA effectively accelerates DiT models by exploiting the rank structure of attention weights, achieving significant speedups while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Brando Miranda,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes and evaluates three different pretraining scaling laws for generative evaluations (mathematical problem-solving, software engineering) using pass-at-k metrics, comparing compute-based, parameters+tokens-based, and gold reference likelihood-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural scaling laws have been extensively studied for pretraining losses and discriminative tasks, there's limited research on scaling laws for generative evaluations like mathematical problem-solving and software engineering, which use different metrics (pass-at-k) than traditional benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose three scaling laws using different covariates: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log likelihoods of gold reference solutions. They evaluate these approaches for fitting and predicting pass-at-k performance on generative tasks.

Result: Key findings: (1) Generative evaluations offer hyperparameter k that affects scaling law parameters and predictability; (2) Compute and parameters+tokens scaling laws stabilize for last ~1.5-2.5 orders of magnitude, while gold reference likelihood scaling law stabilizes for ~5 orders; (3) All three perform comparably with slight variations by k value; (4) Theoretical connection shows compute scaling law emerges from parameters+tokens scaling law.

Conclusion: The framework provides researchers and practitioners with methodologies to forecast generative performance, establishing that different scaling law approaches have varying stability ranges but comparable predictive performance for generative evaluations.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

*Runyu Zhang,Na Li,Asuman Ozdaglar,Jeff Shamma,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism in multi-agent reinforcement learning, unifying risk-sensitive learning and optimism for improved cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimistic methods in cooperative MARL are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, while risk-averse approaches often lead to suboptimal equilibria. There's a need for a theoretically sound optimistic framework.

Method: Proposes optimistic value functions based on dual representation of convex risk measures, formalizing optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Derives policy-gradient theorem and develops decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms.

Result: Empirical results show risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods in cooperative benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for device-cloud LLM collaboration where on-device LLMs make routing decisions through post-training, using a reward maximization approach with group-adaptive policy gradient to optimize when to offload queries to cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing binary classifier routers struggle to determine task difficulty from prompt patterns, limiting effective device-cloud collaboration for LLM deployment.

Method: On-device LLM makes routing decisions after solving process, using reward maximization with carefully designed rewards and group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm with adaptive prompt filtering.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing baselines and significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance across models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective device-cloud collaboration by allowing on-device LLMs to intelligently decide when to offload queries to cloud, achieving better performance than existing routing approaches.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

*Julia Wenkmann,Damien Garreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) variability, showing their variance decreases as 1/N where N is the number of random examples, and offers practical recommendations for efficient application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs are a popular concept-based explanation method, but their computation involves random sampling which introduces variability. Understanding and quantifying this variability is crucial for reliable and reproducible explanations.

Method: The authors conduct a fine-grained theoretical analysis of CAVs construction to mathematically quantify their variability, supported by experiments on multiple real-life datasets.

Result: The analysis reveals a universal result: CAVs variance decreases proportionally to 1/N, where N is the number of random examples used in their computation.

Conclusion: Based on the theoretical findings, the paper provides practical recommendations for resource-efficient application of CAVs method while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

TL;DR: ICQL is a new offline RL framework that treats Q-learning as contextual inference using linear Transformers to infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions, achieving better performance than single global Q-function approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL approaches rely on single global Q-functions that struggle to capture compositional nature of tasks with diverse subtasks.

Method: Formulates Q-learning as contextual inference problem using linear Transformers to adaptively infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.

Result: Improves performance in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4%, Gym tasks by up to 8.6%, and Adroit tasks by up to 6.3%. Theoretically achieves bounded Q-function approximation error and supports near-optimal policy extraction.

Conclusion: ICQL demonstrates the potential of in-context learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning it as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Method: Developed a Small Math Model (SMM) using neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs, incorporating counting practice, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention mechanisms.

Result: The SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and shows wave-like use of finger-counting as sum recall improves, similar to earlier SCT findings.

Conclusion: The SMM provides a foundation to extend SCT research to adaptive strategy choice and strategy discovery, offering a unified platform to study numerical understanding and mathematical reasoning in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

### [309] [AQUAIR: A High-Resolution Indoor Environmental Quality Dataset for Smart Aquaculture Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24069)
*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUAIR is an open-access public dataset of indoor environmental quality variables from a fish aquaculture facility in Morocco, providing over 23,000 quality-controlled observations for smart aquaculture research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets describing air conditions in indoor aquaculture facilities are scarce, limiting development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that link air quality with water-quality dynamics.

Method: Used a single Awair HOME monitor to sample six IEQ variables every five minutes from October 2024 to January 2025, with ISO-compliant mounting, calibration checks, and an open-source processing pipeline for data normalization and gap interpolation.

Result: Produced a dataset showing stable environmental conditions with feeding-time peaks, suitable for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies.

Conclusion: AQUAIR fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for machine learning curricula and environmental sensing research in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper combines Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) with contrastive learning by proposing four kernelized matrix costs for data density approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve self-supervised and contrastive feature learning by integrating pairwise distance-based costs with MDNs for better density approximation.

Method: Proposes four types of kernelized matrix costs: scalar cost, vector-matrix cost, matrix-matrix cost (trace of Schur complement), and SVD cost (nuclear norm) to learn multiple centers for mixture density definition.

Result: The approach enables effective data density approximation by learning multiple centers through the proposed kernelized matrix costs combined with MDNs.

Conclusion: The integration of MDNs with contrastive costs using kernelized matrix costs provides an effective framework for density approximation in self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

### [311] [Demographic-Agnostic Fairness without Harm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24077)
*Zhongteng Cai,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Xueru Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DAFH algorithm for demographic-agnostic fairness that learns group partitions and decoupled classifiers without requiring demographic data during training, achieving better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing fairness approaches: parity-based methods sacrifice accuracy, while preference-based methods require demographic data. Need for fairness methods that don't compromise accuracy and work without demographic information.

Method: DAFH algorithm jointly learns a group classifier to partition population into groups and decoupled classifiers for each group. Uses demographic-agnostic approach without requiring demographic data during training.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows method outperforms baselines when demographic information is known. Experiments on synthetic and real data validate the proposed approach.

Conclusion: DAFH provides effective demographic-agnostic fairness solution that avoids accuracy degradation and doesn't require demographic data, addressing key limitations of existing fairness methods.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

TL;DR: PEARL is a framework using on-device LLMs for cooperative D2D communication optimization, improving performance and energy efficiency through peer-aware context and reward-aligned training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend single-device on-device LLMs to cooperative scenarios by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states for better Wi-Fi Aware parameter selection in D2D communication.

Method: Uses context-aware reward (normalizing latency by application tolerances and modulating energy by battery states) for KL-based finetuning. Two variants: PEARL (Head + LoRA) and PEARL-Lite (Head-only).

Result: PEARL improves objective scores over baselines, reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases, and PEARL-Lite achieves sub-20ms inference with near-identical performance.

Conclusion: Peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control in D2D communication.

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Clebsch-Gordan Transformer achieves efficient global attention using Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on SO(3) irreducible representations, enabling equivariant modeling with O(N log N) complexity and supporting high-order features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equivariant transformers are limited to low-order features and local context windows due to quadratic computational costs of global attention, restricting their expressiveness and performance.

Method: Proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer with novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on SO(3) irreducible representations, exploiting sparsity of Clebsch-Gordon matrix for efficiency, and optionally incorporates token permutation equivariance.

Result: Achieves O(N log N) computational complexity, scales well with high-order irreducible features, and shows clear gains in GPU memory size, speed, and accuracy across n-body simulation, QM9, ModelNet classification, and robotic grasping benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enables efficient global attention for equivariant transformers while supporting features at all orders, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

*Evan Dramko,Yihuang Xiong,Yizhi Zhu,Geoffroy Hautier,Thomas Reps,Christopher Jermaine,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT is a machine-learning force field that uses Transformer architecture instead of graph neural networks to model point defects in materials, achieving better accuracy and lower computational cost than GNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-principles methods for computing defect properties are computationally expensive, and existing MLFFs based on GNNs suffer from oversmoothing and poor long-range interaction representation, which are critical issues for modeling point defects.

Method: ADAPT replaces graph representations with direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions using a Transformer encoder, treating atoms as tokens.

Result: Applied to silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves ~33% reduction in both force and energy prediction errors compared to state-of-the-art GNN-based models, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: The Transformer-based ADAPT model provides a more effective and efficient approach for modeling point defects in materials compared to GNN-based MLFFs.

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: GeoFunFlow is a geometric diffusion model framework for solving inverse problems on complex geometries, combining a geometric function autoencoder with latent diffusion to achieve accurate reconstructions and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse PDE problems are challenging due to ill-posedness, data sparsity, and irregular geometries. Classical methods are computationally expensive, while existing learning approaches are limited to regular domains or forward modeling.

Method: Combines geometric function autoencoder (GeoFAE) with Perceiver module for processing unstructured meshes and latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow for posterior sampling from sparse noisy data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy on complex geometries across five benchmarks, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and offers efficient inference compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow effectively addresses inverse problems on complex geometries with superior accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and computational efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

*Md Mozaharul Mottalib,Thao-Ly T. Phan,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyMaTE is a hybrid model combining State Space Models (Mamba) and Transformers for EHR representation learning, addressing limitations of both approaches in handling long, multivariate EHR sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data presents challenges with long sequences, sparsity, and missing values. Transformers have quadratic complexity limitations, while SSMs like Mamba focus on sequence-level rather than channel-level data mixing.

Method: Proposed HyMaTE model that integrates State Space Models (specifically Mamba) with attention mechanisms to create a hybrid architecture for longitudinal EHR data representation.

Result: HyMaTE demonstrated effective performance on predictive tasks across multiple clinical datasets, capturing richer and more nuanced EHR representations while maintaining interpretability through self-attention.

Conclusion: HyMaTE provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world healthcare applications by combining the efficiency of SSMs with the representational power of attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

### [317] [Echo Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122)
*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo Flow Networks (EFNs) introduce a novel reservoir computing framework with Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA) and dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art time-series forecasting performance with significantly improved computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between computational complexity and long-range dependency capture in time-series forecasting, while addressing the limited nonlinear capacity of traditional Echo State Networks.

Method: EFNs combine extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by MCRA for complex temporal dynamics, and use a dual-stream architecture where recent input selects features from infinite-horizon memory.

Result: EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training, 3x smaller model size, and reduce forecasting error from 43% to 35% (20% relative improvement), with EchoFormer achieving SOTA performance across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: The EFN framework successfully balances computational efficiency with expressive power for long-range time-series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

*Rohan Alur,Chris Hays,Manish Raghavan,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoder-only transformers cannot learn inverse permutation tasks, but become capable when using causal attention masks or scratch tokens, suggesting alternative reasoning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model robustness in reasoning tasks like long-context retrieval and multiple choice QA by studying inverse permutation learning as a natural test case.

Method: Analyze decoder-only transformers' expressive capacity for inverse permutation tasks, comparing with encoder-decoder architectures and testing with scratch tokens.

Result: Proved impossibility for arbitrary depth decoder-only transformers, but showed feasibility with causal attention masks or input padding using scratch tokens.

Conclusion: Scratch tokens may enable reasoning in LLMs through intermediate computations, even without semantic meaning, offering insights into chain-of-thought prompting mechanisms.

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MASC algorithm using localized trigonometric polynomial kernels for classification that automatically determines number of classes and achieves perfect classification with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classification approaches rely on function approximation; this paper offers an alternative using signal processing techniques to separate class distributions rather than approximate functions.

Method: Uses localized trigonometric polynomial kernels originally developed for point source separation in signal processing, adapted to separate supports of different probability distributions representing classes. Applied hierarchically in MASC algorithm to handle overlapping class boundaries.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on simulated and real datasets including Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and document datasets, achieving perfect classification with minimal labeled queries.

Conclusion: The signal processing-inspired approach provides an effective alternative to function approximation for classification, capable of automatically determining class numbers and achieving high accuracy with minimal supervision.

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning approach for cyclone forecasting using time series data achieves 93% accuracy with random forest classifier and low error regression predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical weather prediction models are computationally intensive and error-prone due to atmospheric chaos. Need for more efficient and accurate cyclone forecasting to minimize loss of life and economic damage.

Method: Two-stage ML pipeline: regression model predicts cyclone features (wind speed, pressure, trajectory) using sliding window of historical data, then classification models (RF, SVM, MLP) predict categorical status. Uses hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE for class imbalance.

Result: RF classifier achieves 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP. Regression yields low errors: pressure within 2.2 mb, wind within 2.4 kt. RF model robust for minority status identification and minimizes false negatives.

Conclusion: ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer effective and scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time prediction and decision support systems.

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

TL;DR: Proposes Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning, a stable method for machine unlearning in LLMs that addresses gradient instability in existing gradient difference approaches by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning approaches in LLMs are unstable and unreliable, particularly the gradient difference method which causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients when combined with cross-entropy loss, leading to training instability and degraded performance.

Method: Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning stabilizes LoRA-based fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters, controlling weight dynamics during gradient ascent to enable reliable convergence of the gradient difference method.

Result: Across TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE benchmarks and architectures from 125M to 8B parameters, the method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving retention.

Conclusion: Establishes a theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for stable machine unlearning in LLMs that addresses the fundamental optimization instability in existing approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE is an asymmetric autoencoder that preserves both global and local geometric structures by applying global constraints to the encoder and local constraints to the decoder, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoders struggle to preserve both global and local geometric structures simultaneously - global methods accumulate distance errors while local methods distort large-scale relationships.

Method: Proposed Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE) with asymmetric architecture: global distance constraints on encoder and local geometric constraints on decoder.

Result: MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation metrics on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The asymmetric design naturally aligns with encoder-decoder roles and effectively preserves multi-scale geometric structure in latent representations.

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

### [323] [Model Correlation Detection via Random Selection Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24171)
*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSP is a statistical framework that detects model correlations by testing transferability of optimized prefixes between models, providing principled p-values for correlation detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting model correlations require model parameters or produce heuristic scores without statistical thresholds, limiting their reliability and applicability.

Method: RSP formulates model correlation detection as hypothesis testing, optimizing prefixes on a reference model for random selection tasks and evaluating their transferability to target models while using baseline models to filter generic features.

Result: RSP consistently yields small p-values for related models and high p-values for unrelated ones across LLMs and VLMs, demonstrating robust performance in detecting model correlations.

Conclusion: RSP provides the first principled statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and interpretable decisions in machine learning ecosystems.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

*Chuntian Chi,John Clapham,Leslie Cloud,Ingrid Pretzer-Aboff,GinaMari Blackwell,Huajie Shao,Gang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-FoG is a real-time foundation model-based wearable system for Freezing-of-Gait detection in Parkinson's disease patients that works on unseen patients without patient-specific training, achieving 98.5% F1-score and 72% battery life improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FoG detection systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack generalization, limiting clinical deployment. FoG affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage PD patients, significantly impairing mobility independence and quality of life.

Method: Combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse IMU datasets with sensor context integration. A lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing to avoid unnecessary computation.

Result: Achieves 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen patients (VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23 PD patients), substantially outperforming baseline methods. Deployed on Google Pixel 8a smartphone, extends battery life by up to 72% while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency.

Conclusion: FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that generalize across patients without individual training requirements, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

### [325] [Negative Pre-activations Differentiate Syntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24198)
*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wasserstein neurons are critical entangled neurons in LLMs that enable syntax processing through negative pre-activation differentiation of similar inputs, especially syntactic tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional role of a sparse subset of entangled neurons (Wasserstein neurons) in large language models and their specific contribution to syntactic processing.

Method: Used targeted ablation experiments by zeroing negative pre-activations of Wasserstein neurons, compared with random and perplexity-matched controls, and analyzed part-of-speech and layer-specific effects across training checkpoints.

Result: Targeted removal of negative pre-activations in Wasserstein neurons collapses model function and disrupts grammatical behavior, while controls leave performance unchanged. The effect accumulates across layers and emerges as neurons stabilize during training.

Conclusion: Negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled Wasserstein neurons is a crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax processing, particularly for syntactic scaffolding tokens.

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

*Chaorui Yao,Yanxi Chen,Yuchang Sun,Yushuo Chen,Wenhao Zhang,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a first-principles derivation showing that group-relative REINFORCE algorithms can be interpreted as native off-policy methods, challenging the conventional view that they are limited to on-policy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in off-policy RL for LLMs due to practical constraints in real-world applications, complex LLM-RL infrastructure, and need for RL methodology innovations.

Method: Presents a first-principles derivation of group-relative REINFORCE without assuming specific training data distribution, showing it admits native off-policy interpretation. Proposes two principles: regularizing policy updates and actively shaping data distribution.

Result: Demystifies myths about importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies OPMD and AsymRE as regularized REINFORCE forms, provides theoretical justification for data-weighting strategies, and validates insights with empirical studies.

Conclusion: The work opens up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs and provides actionable insights validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

*Yuyang Sha,Hongxin Pan,Gang Luo,Caijuan Shi,Jing Wang,Kefeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker is a reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for major depressive disorder diagnosis that combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional methods and general-purpose LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDD diagnostic approaches rely on subjective assessments and lack multimodal integration. LLMs offer promise but face challenges with interpretability, hallucination, and synthetic data reliance.

Method: Developed MDD-Thinker using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on 40,000 reasoning samples from UK Biobank plus 10,000 from public mental health datasets. Evaluated against traditional ML/DL methods and state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Achieved 0.8268 accuracy and 0.8081 F1-score, significantly outperforming traditional baselines and general-purpose LLMs. Combined SFT+RL yielded 29.0% accuracy improvement, 38.1% F1-score gain, and 34.8% AUC increase with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MDD-Thinker provides the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for MDD diagnosis using real-world clinical data, balancing accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency for scalable psychiatric diagnostics.

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conda is a new optimizer that combines Adam's coordinate-wise adaptivity with global spectral normalization, achieving 2-2.5x faster convergence than AdamW in LLM pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of Adam optimizers which suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank structures, while Muon lacks per-coordinate adaptivity.

Method: Projects updates into orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on projected gradients.

Result: Achieves 2-2.5x faster convergence than AdamW on LLaMA series, outperforms AdamW, Muon and other baselines in pre-training experiments.

Conclusion: Conda is an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training that bridges the strengths of Adam and spectral normalization approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods with pretrained text-to-image models often distort fine details or introduce artifacts, making precise content editing challenging.

Method: Uses coupled SDEs to guide sampling process of any pre-trained generative model that can be sampled by solving SDEs (including diffusion and rectified flow models), driving both source and edited images with same correlated noise.

Result: Achieves high prompt fidelity with near-pixel-level consistency, steering new samples toward desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to source image.

Conclusion: Coupled SDEs provide a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI that works out-of-the-box without retraining or auxiliary networks.

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome prohibitive costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems for ML integration, especially for SMEs.

Method: Lightweight, browser-based interface with human-in-the-loop approach, allowing experts interactive control over model parameters.

Result: Enables ML adoption with zero production downtime, eliminates need for local hardware upgrades, and fosters trust through expert control.

Conclusion: Provides scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and safety while strengthening manufacturing competitiveness.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

*Wei Wang,Dong-Dong Wu,Ming Li,Jingxiong Zhang,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first benchmark for PU learning algorithms to address inconsistent experimental settings and identify critical factors affecting fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PU learning research suffers from highly inconsistent experimental settings, making it difficult to compare algorithm performance fairly. Many algorithms rely on unrealistic validation sets with negative data, and existing evaluations are biased towards one-sample settings.

Method: The authors propose a systematic PU learning benchmark that investigates model selection criteria without negative data, identifies the internal label shift problem in one-sample settings, and introduces a calibration approach for fair comparisons across different PU learning families.

Result: The benchmark framework provides tools to handle realistic PU learning scenarios where no negative validation data is available, and addresses the bias between one-sample and two-sample settings through calibration methods.

Conclusion: This work establishes an accessible, realistic, and fair evaluation environment for future PU learning algorithm comparisons, addressing critical issues in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChessArena testbed evaluates LLMs' strategic reasoning through chess gameplay, revealing current models struggle significantly and cannot beat amateur-level chess engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs possess genuine complex strategic reasoning skills or just sophisticated pattern recognition from training data.

Method: Developed ChessArena - a competitive framework where LLMs play chess against each other under four different play modes, with ranking algorithm and leaderboard. Evaluated 13 LLMs playing over 800 games.

Result: No LLM could beat Maia-1100 (amateur-level chess engine), some failed to defeat random players. Fine-tuned Qwen3-8B showed substantial improvement, approaching state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant shortcomings in strategic reasoning capabilities, though fine-tuning can substantially improve performance.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFM is the first framework that applies pretrain-transfer paradigm to solve distance-based optimization problems on graphs, using self-supervised pre-training on graph paths to internalize topological rules and enable efficient optimization across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the successful pretrain-transfer paradigm in language models and Operations Research problems on graphs, which face conflicts between statistical flexibility and combinatorial constraints.

Method: Introduces Graph Foundation Model (GFM) with self-supervised pre-training on paths from random walks, treating graph connectivity as supervisory signal, then uses simple generative heuristic for optimization tasks.

Result: Achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across networks from 20 to 893 nodes on various optimization tasks, with significantly faster inference times.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for adapting pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, enabling foundation model innovations to be applied to Operations Research.

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simulation framework for modeling ESP cheaters and detectors using reinforcement learning and adversarial games to study adaptive cheating behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP cheats are hard to detect due to lack of observable evidence and cheaters' adaptive behaviors, making reliable labeled data collection difficult for anti-cheat systems.

Method: Propose a simulation framework with RL agents representing cheaters/non-cheaters with different observability levels, detectors classifying behavioral trajectories, and adversarial game formulation for co-adaptation. Includes structured cheater model that dynamically switches behaviors based on detection risk.

Result: Framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward optimization and detection evasion.

Conclusion: Provides a controllable and extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

TL;DR: ELASTIQ is a foundation model that aligns EEG signals with language instructions to improve brain-computer interface performance by incorporating semantic task guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG foundation models struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints, limiting their ability to leverage semantic knowledge to unify different labels and tasks.

Method: Uses joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module for pretraining with frequency masking and temporal objectives, and Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF) for instruction tuning that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of 20 datasets across motor imagery, emotion recognition, SSVEP, covert speech, and healthcare tasks, with best average results across all five task categories.

Conclusion: Task instructions serve as semantic priors that guide EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces, enhancing decoding robustness and transferability.

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Motivation: Distributed reinforcement learning methods remain less explored compared to non-distributed approaches, especially in heterogeneous asynchronous settings with communication bottlenecks.

Method: Two new algorithms: Rennala NIGT for homogeneous settings with AllReduce operation support, and Malenia NIGT for heterogeneous environments with asynchronous computations.

Result: Rennala NIGT improves total computational and communication complexity in homogeneous settings. Malenia NIGT achieves strictly better theoretical guarantees for heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly outperform prior approaches, with experiments corroborating the theoretical advantages in both homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed RL settings.

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

### [337] [A study of Universal ODE approaches to predicting soil organic carbon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24306)
*Satyanarayana Raju G. V. V,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Scientific Machine Learning framework using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) was developed to predict Soil Organic Carbon dynamics, showing strong performance in clean/moderate noise conditions but limitations under high noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil Organic Carbon prediction is challenging due to complex physical, chemical, and biological processes, requiring methods that can integrate mechanistic understanding with data-driven learning.

Method: Used Universal Differential Equations that combine mechanistic physics (advection-diffusion transport) with neural networks to learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration, evaluated across six experimental cases with varying noise levels.

Result: Excellent performance in clean conditions (MSE = 1.6e-5, R² = 0.9999) and moderate noise (7% noise: MSE = 3.4e-6, R² = 0.99998), but overfitting with 35% noise at t=0 (R² = 0.94) and poor performance with 35% noise at t=50 (negative R²).

Conclusion: UDEs are suitable for scalable, noise-tolerant SOC forecasting but require noise-aware loss functions, probabilistic modeling, and better microbial dynamics integration for field deployment.

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

*Xianhang Li,Chen Huang,Chun-Liang Li,Eran Malach,Josh Susskind,Vimal Thilak,Etai Littwin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT proposes a two-stage video representation learning method that uses a frozen teacher encoder trained with pixel reconstruction, followed by a student that predicts the teacher's latents on masked regions, eliminating the need for EMA updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMA-based methods like V-JEPA complicate model selection and couple teacher-student architectures. The authors aim to simplify masked-latent prediction by showing that a frozen teacher suffices for effective representation learning.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Train target encoder with pixel reconstruction under V-JEPA masking, (2) Freeze teacher and train student to predict teacher's latents on masked regions. This decouples optimization into separate pixel reconstruction and masked latent prediction stages.

Result: SALT outperforms V-JEPA 2 encoders in frozen evaluation across benchmarks, achieves higher compute efficiency with better accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier, and shows student quality is robust to teacher quality even with sub-optimal teachers.

Conclusion: SALT provides a simpler, more scalable and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning, with compute budget allocation favoring the student over teacher optimization.

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

*Dipan Maity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AuON is a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, using hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling with normalization to preserve structural alignment and recondition ill-posed updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional orthogonal gradient methods like SVD/QR have O(n^3) computational costs and underperform compared to SGD with momentum. Recent methods like Muon reduce complexity to O(n^2) but quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.

Method: AuON bounds momentum updates under a spectral-norm trust region using hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, preserving directional information without explicit semi-orthogonalization. Also introduces Hybrid-AuON with a single Newton-Schulz iteration.

Result: Experiments across vision and language benchmarks show AuON and Hybrid-AuON achieve performance comparable to strong baselines like AdamW and Muon.

Conclusion: AuON provides an efficient linear-time alternative to orthogonal gradient methods that maintains competitive performance while avoiding the computational bottlenecks of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

### [340] [H+: An Efficient Similarity-Aware Aggregation for Byzantine Resilient Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24330)
*Shiyuan Zuo,Rongfei Fan,Cheng Zhan,Jie Xu,Puning Zhao,Han Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H+ is a novel similarity-aware aggregation method for Federated Learning that defends against Byzantine attacks by randomly selecting parameter segments and comparing them to reference vectors, working effectively both with and without clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity-aware aggregation methods for Byzantine attack mitigation in FL require clean data, making them inapplicable to settings where such data is unavailable.

Method: H+ randomly selects r-dimensional segments from p-dimensional parameter vectors and applies a similarity function H to compare each segment against a reference vector (derived from robust algorithms or clean data), repeating K times to identify honest clients.

Result: H+ demonstrates substantial robustness improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and multiple attack types, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios and datasets.

Conclusion: H+ is an effective Byzantine-resilient aggregation method that works with or without clean data, maintains low computational complexity, and outperforms existing methods in robustness against various Byzantine attacks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

### [341] [Towards Generalizable PDE Dynamics Forecasting via Physics-Guided Invariant Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24332)
*Siyang Li,Yize Chen,Yan Guo,Ming Huang,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes iMOOE, a physics-guided invariant learning method for spatiotemporal PDE forecasting that achieves superior zero-shot generalization across out-of-distribution scenarios by capturing fundamental PDE invariance principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for PDE forecasting struggle with zero-shot generalization across unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, requiring additional test-time adaptation. This limitation stems from not properly capturing the fundamental physical invariance in PDE dynamical systems.

Method: The authors define a two-fold PDE invariance principle (ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant) and propose iMOOE with an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert architecture and frequency-enriched invariant learning objective to capture this invariance.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks and real-world applications show iMOOE achieves superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization capabilities across diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: By explicitly capturing the fundamental physical invariance in PDE systems, iMOOE enables effective zero-shot generalization across out-of-distribution forecasting scenarios without requiring test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

*Qingquan Zhang,Ziqi Wang,Yuchen Li,Keyuan Zhang,Bo Yuan,Jialin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework for game level generation that optimizes multiple diversity metrics simultaneously, addressing the limitations of existing approaches that fail to comprehensively assess multi-dimensional diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing level generation approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across multiple dimensions, as level diversity metrics are naturally multi-dimensional with conflicted, complementary, or both relationships among dimensions.

Method: Formulates model training as a multi-objective learning problem where each diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective, and proposes a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimizes multiple diversity metrics simultaneously throughout training.

Result: Case study on Super Mario Bros demonstrates enhanced multi-dimensional diversity and identification of a Pareto front of generative models providing tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics (content-based and player-centered).

Conclusion: The framework enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators accommodating various scenarios and diverse needs of players and designers through the identified Pareto front.

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

*Thibaud Gloaguen,Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First watermark for diffusion language models (DLMs) that works with arbitrary token generation order, addressing the challenge of unavailable context tokens by applying watermark in expectation and promoting tokens that increase watermark strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ARLM watermarks rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available in DLM generation due to arbitrary token order generation, creating a need for specialized DLM watermarking.

Method: Apply watermark in expectation over context when some tokens are undetermined, and promote tokens that increase watermark strength when used as context for other tokens, while keeping the detector unchanged.

Result: Achieves >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling reliable DLM watermarking for the first time.

Conclusion: Successfully developed the first effective watermark for diffusion language models that works with their arbitrary token generation paradigm while maintaining high detection rates and minimal quality degradation.

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

### [344] [Evolution Strategies at Scale: LLM Fine-Tuning Beyond Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24372)
*Xin Qiu,Yulu Gan,Conor F. Hayes,Qiyao Liang,Elliot Meyerson,Babak Hodjat,Risto Miikkulainen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evolution Strategies (ES) can effectively fine-tune large language models with billions of parameters, outperforming reinforcement learning methods in sample efficiency, reward tolerance, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ES was previously neglected for LLM fine-tuning due to perceived scalability issues, but this work challenges that assumption and explores ES as an alternative to RL methods.

Method: Scaled up evolution strategies to fine-tune full parameters of large language models, demonstrating ES can efficiently search over billions of parameters.

Result: ES outperforms RL fine-tuning methods in multiple aspects: better sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness across different base LLMs, less reward hacking, and more stable performance.

Conclusion: ES serves as a new direction for LLM fine-tuning beyond current RL techniques, proving its scalability and effectiveness for large models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

### [345] [AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378)
*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS is a framework that enhances LLMs for explainable time-series anomaly detection by providing three complementary hints (numeric, context-integrated, and task-prior) instead of direct time-to-text serialization, achieving better explanations and competitive detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches for explainable time-series anomaly detection struggle with processing continuous signals and lack contextual grounding due to naive time-to-text serialization.

Method: AXIS conditions frozen LLMs with three hints: symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, context-integrated step-aligned hint from pretrained time-series encoder for fine-grained dynamics, and task-prior hint for global anomaly characteristics.

Result: AXIS produces significantly higher quality explanations and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.

Conclusion: The AXIS framework effectively bridges the modality gap between time series and LLMs, enabling nuanced time-series understanding and high-quality explanations for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon optimizer enables efficient transformer training with 48-52% less computation than AdamW while maintaining or improving perplexity, with additional gains when combined with MLA and MoE architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation of Muon optimizer for efficient transformer training, particularly focusing on its convergence properties and synergy with modern architectural optimizations.

Method: Comprehensive theoretical analysis including convergence rate proofs, spectral regularization properties, connections to natural gradient descent, and equivalence to steepest gradient descent. Empirical validation across 100+ training runs with small to medium decoder transformers (30M-200M parameters).

Result: Muon achieves target loss with 48-52% less training computation than AdamW while maintaining or improving final perplexity. Combined with MLA+MoE, achieves 68% memory reduction, 3.2x inference speedup, and 8-12% perplexity improvement.

Conclusion: Muon is established as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that excels with modern efficiency techniques and large-batch training, expanding the Pareto frontier in compute-time trade-offs.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScatterAD is a novel anomaly detection method that leverages representation scattering in high-dimensional space to improve spatio-temporal anomaly detection in industrial IoT time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection methods fail to capture complex spatio-temporal couplings in multivariate data and have limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: Proposes ScatterAD with topological encoder for graph-structured scattering, temporal encoder to constrain over-scattering via MSE minimization, and contrastive fusion for complementary temporal-topological representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Leveraging representation scattering as an inductive signal effectively enhances spatio-temporal anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

TL;DR: BiHDTrans is a neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional Transformer that combines HD computing efficiency with Transformer temporal modeling power, achieving superior accuracy and 39.4x lower latency than SOTA binary Transformers on FPGA hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of HD computing in capturing complex temporal patterns and Transformers' high computational overhead for IoT multivariate time series classification in resource-constrained edge environments.

Method: Integrates self-attention into HD computing paradigm, binarizing in holographic high-dimensional space to minimize information distortion, and leverages independent and identically distributed properties for hardware acceleration.

Result: Outperforms SOTA HD computing models by at least 14.47%, achieves 6.67% higher average accuracy than SOTA binary Transformers, and delivers 39.4x lower inference latency with FPGA acceleration.

Conclusion: BiHDTrans successfully bridges the gap between Transformer expressiveness and HD computing efficiency, enabling accurate, scalable, and low-latency multivariate time series classification for edge IoT applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semantic compression method for multimodal embeddings that reduces storage requirements by leveraging modality alignment to replace multiple embeddings with single centroids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal representation learning creates high-dimensional embeddings that are storage-intensive and computationally expensive for downstream processing, creating scalability challenges.

Method: The approach uses the insight that when modality gap is reduced, embeddings from different modalities sharing the same semantics occupy a common space region, allowing replacement with centroids for compression.

Result: The proposed semantic compression method achieves significant memory savings across diverse large-scale multimodal tasks without performance degradation.

Conclusion: Modality alignment is crucial for enabling effective semantic compression, allowing substantial memory reduction while preserving semantic representation capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

*Yingshi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An evolutionary training framework for LLMs that divides models into experts, trains one expert per step with evolutionary operators, and saves only the best expert for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce model size for inference and improve training efficiency by using evolutionary methods to transfer knowledge between experts.

Method: Divide LLM into experts, train one expert per step with AdamW optimization, apply evolutionary operators (crossover, PSO, mutation) between current and best expert, save only best expert weights.

Result: Best expert achieves nearly same accuracy as full model, reduces model size for inference, accelerates training throughput by 10x+, and requires less memory.

Conclusion: Evolutionary framework enables efficient LLM training with significant memory and throughput improvements while maintaining accuracy, suitable for deployment on PCs and edge devices.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

*Zifan Wang,Xinlei Yi,Xenia Konti,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel federated learning method that combines distributionally robust optimization with outlier resilience using unbalanced Wasserstein distance and KL penalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRO-based FL methods overlook the detrimental impact of outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias learned models.

Method: Introduces ambiguity set based on unbalanced Wasserstein distance with KL penalization, reformulates as Lagrangian penalty optimization, and proposes distributionally outlier-robust federated learning algorithm.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, with established convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses both distribution shifts and outlier resilience in federated learning, providing robustness certificates and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KREPES is a scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning using Nyström approximation, enabling efficient learning on large datasets while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel methods have strong theoretical foundations but suffer from scalability issues, especially for representation learning with massive unlabeled data in the foundation model era.

Method: Uses Nyström approximation to create a unified framework for kernel-based representation learning that supports various unsupervised and self-supervised losses.

Result: Demonstrated efficiency on large image and tabular datasets while enabling principled interpretability of learned representations.

Conclusion: KREPES bridges the gap between kernel methods' theoretical strengths and practical scalability needs for modern representation learning, offering interpretability advantages over deep models.

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

*Ran Elbaz,Guy Bar-Shalom,Yam Eitan,Fabrizio Frasca,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FS-KAN is a principled framework for building permutation equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that unifies and extends previous work, offering superior data efficiency while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a general framework for applying equivariant KANs to data with permutation symmetries, despite their promise in interpretability and expressivity compared to traditional MLPs.

Method: Introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN) by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup, constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for arbitrary permutation symmetry groups.

Result: FS-KANs demonstrate superior data efficiency compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, particularly in low-data regimes, while preserving KANs' interpretability and adaptability.

Conclusion: FS-KANs provide an excellent architecture choice for permutation-symmetric data, combining the benefits of equivariant networks with KANs' advantages in interpretability and data efficiency.

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

*Zhaomin Wu,Haodong Zhao,Ziyang Wang,Jizhou Guo,Qian Wang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes LLM DNA, a low-dimensional representation of language model functional behavior that enables tracking evolutionary relationships among models through fine-tuning, distillation, and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LLMs has created millions of models with undocumented evolutionary relationships, making LLM management difficult. Existing methods are limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict architectural assumptions.

Method: Mathematically defines LLM DNA as a bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior, proves its inheritance properties, and develops a training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. Uses phylogenetic algorithms to construct evolutionary trees from DNA comparisons.

Result: Tested on 305 LLMs, DNA aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves competitive performance on specific tasks. DNA comparisons reveal undocumented relationships and construct evolutionary trees that reflect architectural shifts (encoder-decoder to decoder-only), temporal progression, and varying evolutionary speeds across families.

Conclusion: LLM DNA provides a general, scalable framework for understanding and tracking the evolutionary relationships among language models, addressing the opacity in the current LLM landscape.

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

*Minh Le,Bao-Ngoc Dao,Huy Nguyen,Quyen Tran,Anh Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMoPE is a novel continual learning framework that uses a sparse Mixture of Experts architecture with shared prompts, activating only relevant experts per input to balance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between task-specific prompts (high performance but linear memory scaling) and shared prompts (efficient but prone to knowledge interference) in continual learning.

Method: Organizes shared prompts into multiple "prompt experts" in a sparse MoE architecture, uses prompt-attention score aggregation for expert selection, adaptive noise for balanced utilization, and prototype-based loss for expert specialization.

Result: Consistently outperforms task-specific prompt methods, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, while significantly reducing parameters and computational costs.

Conclusion: SMoPE successfully reconciles the efficiency-performance trade-off in prompt-based continual learning through sparse expert activation and dynamic routing.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

*Jonas Hübotter,Patrik Wolf,Alexander Shevchenko,Dennis Jüni,Andreas Krause,Gil Kur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-time training (TTT) improves performance by specializing foundation models on test tasks, addressing global underparameterization through concept-focused capacity allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why and when TTT is effective, challenging previous explanations focused on out-of-distribution adaptation and proposing that foundation models are globally underparameterized, requiring specialization after generalization.

Method: Proposed a theoretical model under the linear representation hypothesis, empirically validated using sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, and conducted scaling studies across image and language tasks.

Result: TTT achieves substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training, with semantic data points explained by few shared concepts, and identified regimes where specialization is most effective.

Conclusion: TTT works by enabling specialization after generalization, focusing model capacity on test-relevant concepts, with practical implications confirmed across multiple domains.

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIDE is a lightweight evidential learning meta-model that attaches to frozen deep learning models to teach them how and when to express uncertainty, improving OOD detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80% without retraining or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc uncertainty quantification methods either inherit misplaced confidence or merely reshape predictions without teaching models when to be uncertain, creating a gap between predictive confidence and reliability.

Method: GUIDE identifies salient internal features via calibration, then uses these features to construct a noise-driven curriculum that explicitly teaches the model how and when to be uncertain. It attaches to frozen models without retraining, architectural modifications, or manual layer selection.

Result: GUIDE improves out-of-distribution detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80% while preserving in-distribution performance. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: GUIDE demonstrates the need for actively guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and reliability, providing a broadly applicable solution that avoids distilling overconfidence from base models.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

TL;DR: SWAX is a hybrid architecture combining sliding-window attention and xLSTM layers that uses stochastic window sizes during training to improve performance on both short and long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the interplay between sliding window attention and linear RNN layers, and address the limitations of fixed window sizes where large windows don't improve long-context performance while small windows hurt short-context tasks.

Method: Introduces SWAX architecture with stochastic window size training, where the sliding window size is varied during training to force the model to leverage both longer context windows and xLSTM memory capabilities.

Result: SWAX with stochastic window sizes significantly outperforms regular window attention on both short and long-context problems, achieving better balance between short-term and long-term context handling.

Conclusion: Stochastic window size training in hybrid attention-RNN architectures enables better utilization of both attention mechanisms for short contexts and RNN memory for long contexts, overcoming limitations of fixed window approaches.

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

TL;DR: Experimental deployment of deep reinforcement learning for active flow control of vortex-induced vibrations in a circular cylinder at Re=3000 using rotary actuation, achieving up to 95% vibration suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate real-time control in challenging experimental settings at high Reynolds numbers, addressing practical constraints like actuator delay that previous low-Reynolds-number simulations didn't handle.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning with rotary actuation, using state feedback (displacement and velocity) and augmented with past control actions to overcome actuation delays.

Result: With state feedback alone: 80% vibration suppression using low-frequency rotary control. With augmented learning: over 95% vibration attenuation using high-frequency rotary control that modifies vortex shedding.

Conclusion: DRL is adaptable for active flow control in real-world experiments and can overcome instrumental limitations like actuation lag, demonstrating practical viability beyond numerical simulations.

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

TL;DR: The Identity Bridge mechanism resolves compositional reasoning failures in LLMs by adding zero-hop identity task supervision, enabling successful out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning through latent geometry reshaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often fail at compositional reasoning tasks, particularly showing the 'curse of two-hop reasoning' where they cannot perform multi-step reasoning even when capable of individual steps.

Method: Introduces Identity Bridge - supervising models on zero-hop identity tasks. Uses theoretical analysis with Emb-MLP model, showing identity supervision reshapes latent geometry through implicit nuclear-norm regularization. For complex tasks, employs small initialization or weight decay to enhance regularization.

Result: Enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning that they otherwise completely fail. Shows identity supervision induces latent space alignment through low-rank solutions that share structure across tasks. Large-scale models achieve two-hop reasoning through latent memory.

Conclusion: Identity Bridge effectively resolves compositionality gaps in LLMs by reshaping latent geometry through implicit regularization, providing crucial insights for enhancing implicit reasoning abilities in large-scale models.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: Physics inductive biases can improve model efficiency (compute, energy, carbon) while maintaining or improving efficacy in spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning focuses too much on model efficacy, leading to large models with high resource consumption and carbon footprint. The paper explores how physics inductive biases can provide better trade-offs between efficacy and efficiency.

Method: Study various models for spatio-temporal forecasting with different levels of physics inductive bias, including standard physics-informed models and newer approaches like flow matching.

Result: Embedding physics inductive biases yields substantial efficiency gains while retaining or improving task efficacy. Flow matching proves useful as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Conclusion: Physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve efficiency and reduce carbon footprint. Model efficiency should become a core consideration alongside efficacy in ML development and deployment.

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

TL;DR: T-POP enables real-time personalization of LLMs by learning from online pairwise preference feedback during text generation, addressing the cold-start problem without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods require extensive user data or resource-intensive fine-tuning, creating a cold-start problem for new users.

Method: T-POP combines test-time alignment with dueling bandits to steer the decoding process of frozen LLMs by learning a reward function online from pairwise preference feedback.

Result: T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed T-POP algorithm effectively addresses the cold-start problem in LLM personalization through online preference learning without model updates.

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Objective Markov Games (MOMG) for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple objectives, proposes Pareto-Nash Equilibrium as the solution concept, proves its existence, and develops efficient algorithms for computing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical multi-agent systems often have agents with diverse objectives, creating complex strategic trade-offs where each agent's performance across multiple criteria depends on joint actions of all agents.

Method: Introduce Multi-Objective Markov Game (MOMG) framework and Pareto-Nash Equilibrium (PNE) solution concept. Prove PNE existence and establish equivalence with Nash Equilibria of linearly scalarized games. Develop online learning algorithms and a two-phase preference-free algorithm that decouples exploration from planning.

Result: Proved existence of Pareto-Nash Equilibrium and established theoretical equivalence with Nash Equilibria of scalarized games. Developed algorithms that can compute PNE for any preference profile without collecting new samples, enabling efficient characterization of the entire Pareto-Nash front.

Conclusion: The MOMG framework provides a comprehensive approach for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple objectives, with theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms for computing Pareto-Nash Equilibria efficiently.

Abstract: In practical multi-agent systems, agents often have diverse objectives, which
makes the system more complex, as each agent's performance across multiple
criteria depends on the joint actions of all agents, creating intricate
strategic trade-offs. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Objective Markov
Game (MOMG), a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple
objectives. We propose the Pareto-Nash Equilibrium (PNE) as the primary
solution concept, where no agent can unilaterally improve one objective without
sacrificing performance on another. We prove existence of PNE, and establish an
equivalence between the PNE and the set of Nash Equilibria of MOMG's
corresponding linearly scalarized games, enabling solutions of MOMG by
transferring to a standard single-objective Markov game. However, we note that
computing a PNE is theoretically and computationally challenging, thus we
propose and study weaker but more tractable solution concepts. Building on
these foundations, we develop online learning algorithm that identify a single
solution to MOMGs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase, preference-free
algorithm that decouples exploration from planning. Our algorithm enables
computation of a PNE for any given preference profile without collecting new
samples, providing an efficient methodological characterization of the entire
Pareto-Nash front.

*Benjamin Alcorn,Eman Hammad*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A multi-agent system model where autonomous agents observe surroundings, predict other agents' future actions using estimation algorithms, and make optimal decisions while managing uncertainty through risk analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve two key problems in multi-agent systems: predicting non-coordinating agents' intentions for behavior prediction and achieving objectives under resource constraints without significant performance sacrifice.

Method: Developed a model where agents observe environment within safety radius, determine surrounding agents' states, estimate future actions using estimation algorithms based on historical trajectory, and act optimally while managing uncertainty through risk analysis.

Result: The proposed approach was validated using two different learning-based decision making frameworks: reinforcement learning and game theoretic algorithms.

Conclusion: The study presents a comprehensive approach for multi-agent systems that combines observation, prediction, and optimal decision-making while effectively managing uncertainty through risk analysis techniques.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are prevalent in a wide range of domains including power
systems, vehicular networks, and robotics. Two important problems to solve in
these types of systems are how the intentions of non-coordinating agents can be
determined to predict future behavior and how the agents can achieve their
objectives under resource constraints without significantly sacrificing
performance. To study this, we develop a model where an autonomous agent
observes the environment within a safety radius of observation, determines the
state of a surrounding agent of interest (within the observation radius),
estimates future actions to be taken, and acts in an optimal way. In the
absence of observations, agents are able to utilize an estimation algorithm to
predict the future actions of other agents based on historical trajectory. The
use of the proposed estimation algorithm introduces uncertainty, which is
managed via risk analysis. The proposed approach in this study is validated
using two different learning-based decision making frameworks: reinforcement
learning and game theoretic algorithms.

*Lingyao Li,Haolun Wu,Zhenkun Li,Jiabei Hu,Yu Wang,Xiaoshan Huang,Wenyue Hua,Wenqian Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: PartnerMAS is a hierarchical multi-agent framework that improves high-dimensional decision-making by decomposing evaluation into three specialized layers, outperforming single-agent and debate-based approaches by 10-15% in match rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional decision-making tasks like business partner selection involve evaluating large candidate pools with diverse features, where single-agent or debate-style LLM systems struggle with scalability and consistency.

Method: A hierarchical multi-agent framework with three layers: Planner Agent designs strategies, Specialized Agents perform role-specific assessments, and Supervisor Agent integrates outputs. Evaluated on a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments.

Result: Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperformed baselines with 10-15% higher match rates. Analysis showed planners respond to domain-informed prompts, specialists provide complementary feature coverage, and supervisors enable effective aggregation.

Conclusion: Structured collaboration among LLM agents generates more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, making PartnerMAS a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.

Abstract: High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection,
involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical,
categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer
strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems
often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose
PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation
into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents
that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates
their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated
benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm
attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS
consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines,
achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows
that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists
produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role
in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among
LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models,
highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional
decision-making in data-rich domains.

*Yifan Yu,Moyan Li,Shaoyuan Xu,Jinmiao Fu,Xinhai Hou,Fan Lai,Bryan Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: CORRECT is a lightweight, training-free framework that uses cached error schemata to recognize and transfer failure patterns in multi-agent systems, improving error localization by up to 19.8% with near-zero overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems face challenges in error recognition due to complex coordination, tool use, and long-horizon reasoning, where minor errors can propagate and cause task failures with significant debugging costs.

Method: CORRECT leverages an online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize recurring failure patterns across new requests, enabling targeted error localization without expensive retraining while adapting to dynamic deployments in subseconds.

Result: Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show CORRECT improves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing methods with near-zero overhead, narrowing the gap between automated and human-level error recognition.

Conclusion: CORRECT demonstrates that leveraging cached error schemata enables efficient and effective error localization in multi-agent systems, providing a practical solution for debugging complex MAS deployments without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly capable of tackling complex
real-world tasks, yet their reliance on inter-agent coordination, tool use, and
long-horizon reasoning makes error recognition particularly challenging. Minor
errors can propagate across agents, escalating into task failures while
producing long, intertwined execution trajectories that impose significant
costs for both human developers and automated systems to debug and analyze. Our
key insight is that, despite surface differences in failure trajectories (e.g.,
logs), MAS errors often recur with similar structural patterns. This paper
presents CORRECT, the first lightweight, training-free framework that leverages
an online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize and transfer knowledge
of failure structures across new requests. This cache-based reuse allows LLMs
to perform targeted error localization at inference time, avoiding the need for
expensive retraining while adapting to dynamic MAS deployments in subseconds.
To support rigorous study in this domain, we also introduce CORRECT-Error, a
large-scale dataset of over 2,000 annotated trajectories collected through a
novel error-injection pipeline guided by real-world distributions, and further
validated through human evaluation to ensure alignment with natural failure
patterns. Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show that CORRECT
improves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing advances while
at near-zero overhead, substantially narrowing the gap between automated and
human-level error recognition.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MAS² introduces a recursive self-generation paradigm for multi-agent systems that autonomously architects bespoke agent systems for diverse problems, achieving up to 19.6% performance gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic multi-agent systems follow a rigid 'generate-once-and-deploy' paradigm, making them brittle and ill-prepared for real-world dynamism and uncertainty.

Method: A 'generator-implementer-rectifier' tri-agent team that dynamically composes and adaptively rectifies target agent systems in response to real-time task demands, trained using Collaborative Tree Optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 19.6% performance gains over SOTA MAS in complex scenarios like deep research and code generation, with superior cross-backbone generalization (up to 15.1% improvement with unseen LLMs) and optimal cost-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: MAS² successfully transcends the limitations of static multi-agent systems through recursive self-generation, demonstrating superior adaptability and performance across diverse tasks without excessive token costs.

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

### [368] [MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034)
*Heming Fu,Guojun Xiong,Jian Li,Shan Lin*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MARLIN is a decentralized reservoir management framework that combines multi-agent reinforcement learning with bio-inspired coordination rules to handle cascading uncertainties in water systems, achieving improved performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies extreme weather events and water disasters, making adaptive reservoir management critical. Traditional centralized optimization struggles with computational complexity and real-world uncertainties, while existing MARL methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty.

Method: MARLIN integrates bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules (inspired by starling murmurations) with multi-agent reinforcement learning. It enables decentralized local decision-making while achieving emergent global coordination, with an LLM providing real-time reward shaping signals for adaptation.

Result: Experiments on USGS data show MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23%, reduces computation by 35%, accelerates flood response by 68%, and exhibits super-linear coordination with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes.

Conclusion: MARLIN demonstrates potential for disaster prevention and community protection through intelligent, scalable water resource management that effectively handles real-world uncertainties and coordination challenges.

Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose
growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management
critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security.
Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading
uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These
uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental
variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons
downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional
centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational
complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while
existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve
effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by
starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment,
separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs
to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In
addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to
adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on
real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%,
cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting
super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000
nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and
protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.
