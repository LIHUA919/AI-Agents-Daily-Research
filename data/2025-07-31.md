### [1] [When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149)
*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how deceptive instructions alter internal representations in LLMs, revealing predictable shifts and distinct subspaces for truthful vs. deceptive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs process deceptive instructions to improve safety and detection methods.

Method: Analyzed internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct using linear probes and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on a factual verification task.

Result: Deceptive instructions cause significant representational shifts, detectable in early-to-mid layers, with distinct subspaces for truthful/deceptive outputs.

Conclusion: Identifies layer- and feature-level signatures of deception, aiding detection and control of instructed dishonesty in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

### [2] [Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22197)
*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper redefines systematicity in AI beyond explainability, distinguishing four senses of 'systematicity of thought' to reconcile it with connectionism and proposing five rationales for applying this ideal to AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To broaden the understanding of systematicity in AI, moving beyond the narrow focus on explainability and addressing the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism.

Method: Offers a conceptual framework distinguishing four senses of 'systematicity of thought' and applies five rationales for systematization to AI models.

Result: Reconciles systematicity with connectionism and identifies the 'hard systematicity challenge,' advocating for a dynamic approach to systematization in AI.

Conclusion: Systematicity in AI should be guided by rationales for systematization, determining how and when AI models need to be systematic.

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

### [3] [CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22281)
*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoEx introduces a hierarchical agent architecture to dynamically update LLM world models, improving planning accuracy by co-evolving with observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents fail to dynamically update their world models, leading to misaligned and erroneous plans.

Method: CoEx uses hierarchical state abstraction and neurosymbolic belief states (textual inferences + symbolic memory) to dynamically update the world model during planning.

Result: CoEx outperforms existing agent paradigms in planning and exploration across diverse scenarios like ALFWorld, PDDL, and Jericho.

Conclusion: CoEx's dynamic world model update mechanism enhances LLM agent planning accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

### [4] [An Explainable Emotion Alignment Framework for LLM-Empowered Agent in Metaverse Service Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22326)
*Qun Ma,Xiao Xue,Ming Zhang,Yifan Shen,Zihan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an explainable emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse service ecosystems to address challenges like character data fusion and ethical safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between virtual and real-world services in Metaverse ecosystems, addressing issues like character data fusion and ethical safety.

Method: An explainable emotion alignment framework integrating factual factors into LLM-based agents' decision-making.

Result: A simulation in an O2O food delivery scenario showed realistic social emergence, validating the framework.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns relational facts for LLM-based agents, enhancing their role in Metaverse services.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magentic-UI is an open-source web interface for human-agent collaboration, combining AI efficiency with human oversight to improve safety and productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents lack human-level performance and pose safety risks; human-in-the-loop systems can mitigate these issues.

Method: Magentic-UI uses a multi-agent architecture with tools like web browsing and code execution, supported by six interaction mechanisms for human involvement.

Result: Evaluations show Magentic-UI's effectiveness in task completion, user interaction, and safety.

Conclusion: Magentic-UI advances safe and efficient human-agent collaboration.

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

### [6] [LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359)
*Qianhong Guo,Wei Xie,Xiaofang Cai,Enze Wang,Shuoyoucheng Ma,Kai Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Baosheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-Crowdsourced, a benchmark-free evaluation method for LLMs, addressing issues like data contamination and subjectivity. It uses LLMs to generate, answer, and evaluate questions, ensuring dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional criteria. Experiments on eight LLMs highlight its effectiveness and reveal novel insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs suffer from data contamination, black-box operation, and subjective preference, making comprehensive evaluation difficult.

Method: Proposes LLM-Crowdsourced, where LLMs generate questions, answer independently, and evaluate mutually, integrating dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional criteria.

Result: Experiments on eight LLMs show the method's effectiveness in distinguishing performance and reveal novel findings like Gemini's superior question-design capability and memorization-based answering in some LLMs.

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced offers a robust, benchmark-free evaluation paradigm, uncovering insights traditional methods miss, and proving consistent in distinguishing LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [7] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI's metacognitive sensitivity (confidence accuracy) and predictive accuracy jointly impact human decision-making. Higher metacognitive sensitivity can compensate for lower predictive accuracy, improving overall decision quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI's confidence estimates (metacognitive sensitivity) and predictive accuracy influence human decision-making in hybrid settings.

Method: Introduced a theoretical framework and conducted a behavioral experiment to assess the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and metacognitive sensitivity.

Result: AI with higher metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance, even if its predictive accuracy is lower.

Conclusion: Evaluating AI assistance should consider both accuracy and metacognitive sensitivity, optimizing both for better decision outcomes.

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

### [8] [On the Definition of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22423)
*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a general criterion for intelligence based on sample fidelity, defining it as the ability to generate samples from a category given samples of it, formalized as ε-category intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture the essence of intelligence in a species-agnostic form that is evaluable and general enough to cover diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior.

Method: Introduces ε-category intelligence, a formal framework where intelligence is measured by the ability to generate samples indistinguishable from original ones within a tolerance ε.

Result: The paper presents the framework, empirical protocols, and discusses implications for evaluation, safety, and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed criterion provides a measurable and general definition of intelligence applicable across diverse paradigms.

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

### [9] [Cross-Border Legal Adaptation of Autonomous Vehicle Design based on Logic and Non-monotonic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22432)
*Zhe Yu,Yiwei Lu,Burkhard Schafer,Zhe Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses legal compliance challenges for autonomous vehicles in transnational contexts, offering a reasoning system to aid designers in adapting designs and understanding legal implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support designers in navigating legal complexities for autonomous vehicles across borders.

Method: Uses argumentation theory and partial order sets of natural numbers to model normative reasoning and priority.

Result: Demonstrates through case analysis how the reasoning system aids flexible design adaptation and legal understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively assists designers in addressing legal compliance challenges for autonomous vehicles internationally.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

### [10] [Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22440)
*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves the Nearest-Better Network (NBN) method by providing a theoretical derivation and an efficient computation method. It applies NBN to OneMax and TSP, revealing landscape features and algorithm limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming NBN computation and extend its application to combinatorial optimization, while analyzing algorithm behavior.

Method: Theoretical derivation of NBN as a maximum probability transition network and an efficient logarithmic linear time computation method.

Result: NBN reveals landscape features of OneMax (neutrality, ruggedness, modality) and TSP (ruggedness, modality, deception). Identifies limitations in EAX and LKH algorithms.

Conclusion: The efficient NBN method enables deeper analysis of optimization landscapes and algorithm behavior, highlighting challenges in state-of-the-art TSP algorithms.

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

*Hongyan Cheng,Chengzhang Yu,Yanshu Shi,Chiyue Wang,Cong Liu,Zhanpeng Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An AI-driven multi-agent system improves emergency department triage by addressing medical specialization gaps, heterogeneous structures, and inefficient questioning, achieving high accuracy in department classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The post-pandemic healthcare demand surge and nursing shortages necessitate innovative AI solutions for efficient and accurate triage.

Method: The system uses three specialized agents (RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent, DepartmentAgent) collaborating via structured inquiry and department-specific rules, evaluated on a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset.

Result: Achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary and 73.9% in secondary department classification after four patient interactions.

Conclusion: The system offers a scalable, adaptable framework for AI-assisted triage in diverse healthcare settings, ensuring clinical soundness.

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

### [12] [MetaAgent: Automatically Constructing Multi-Agent Systems Based on Finite State Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22606)
*Yaolun Zhang,Xiaogeng Liu,Chaowei Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaAgent is a framework for automatically generating multi-agent systems using finite state machines, outperforming other auto-designed methods and matching human-designed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks are limited to pre-defined scenarios, and automated methods lack flexibility, tool integration, and robust communication.

Method: MetaAgent uses finite state machines to design and optimize multi-agent systems from task descriptions, controlling agent actions and state transitions.

Result: Experiments show MetaAgent surpasses other auto-designed methods and performs comparably to human-designed systems.

Conclusion: MetaAgent provides a flexible and effective solution for automated multi-agent system design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

*Sebastian Monka,Irlan Grangel-González,Stefan Schmid,Lavdim Halilaj,Marc Rickart,Oliver Rudolph,Rui Dias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs to translate natural language queries into SPARQL for KGs in manufacturing, showing improved accuracy with context-aware prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between non-experts and complex KG querying by leveraging LLMs for natural language to SPARQL translation.

Method: Evaluated multiple strategies for feeding KG context to LLMs, focusing on manufacturing KGs like Bosch Line Information System and I40 Core Information Model.

Result: LLMs perform better in generating accurate SPARQL queries when provided with adequate KG schema context, reducing errors.

Conclusion: Context-aware LLM techniques can democratize access to KGs, aiding decision-making in manufacturing.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces asp-fzn, a solver for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP), which translates CASP programs into FlatZinc for use with various backend solvers. It shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art ASP solvers and outperforms clingcon in some CASP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Answer Set Programming (ASP) with linear constraints and provide a solver-independent approach using FlatZinc, enabling compatibility with multiple backend solvers.

Method: The method involves translating CASP programs into the FlatZinc language, supporting linear constraints and global constraints, and evaluating performance against ASP and CASP solvers.

Result: asp-fzn is competitive with state-of-the-art ASP solvers and outperforms clingcon on some CASP benchmarks, demonstrating promising performance.

Conclusion: asp-fzn is a viable and competitive solver for CASP, offering flexibility through FlatZinc and strong performance in both ASP and CASP domains.

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAAC is a reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-agent collaboration, using attention mechanisms and a penalized loss function to improve teamwork. It outperforms benchmarks in simulated soccer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing multi-agent collaboration in cooperative environments by addressing the challenges of joint-action spaces and role diversity.

Method: Centralized Training/Centralized Execution with multi-headed attention in actor and critic, plus a penalized loss function for role diversity.

Result: TAAC outperforms benchmarks (PPO, MAAC) in simulated soccer, showing better win rates, goal differentials, and collaborative behaviors.

Conclusion: TAAC effectively improves multi-agent collaboration through dynamic communication and role diversity, demonstrating superior performance in cooperative tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

*Yiwen Sun,Furong Ye,Zhihan Chen,Ke Wei,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoModSAT, a tool using LLMs, optimizes SAT solvers by addressing LLM compatibility, prompt optimization, and efficient search, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing SAT solvers is challenging due to complex architectures and limited gains from existing methods. This work leverages LLMs for better performance.

Method: Develops AutoModSAT with guidelines for LLM-friendly solvers, automatic prompt optimization, and an efficient search strategy combining presearch and EA algorithms.

Result: AutoModSAT improves performance by 50% over baselines, 30% over SOTA solvers, and achieves a 20% speedup compared to tuned alternatives.

Conclusion: The work bridges AI-driven heuristics with system optimization, offering methodological and empirical advancements for solver development.

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

### [18] [CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning for Robust Instruction Following in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22074)
*Yangshu Yuan,Heng Chen,Xinyi Jiang,Christian Ng,Kexin Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIMR, a new framework for multi-modal reasoning, outperforms top models like GPT-4V with 91.5% accuracy by using iterative refinement and dynamic feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with complex multi-step tasks requiring logical reasoning and self-correction.

Method: CIMR uses a two-stage process: initial reasoning followed by iterative refinement with multi-modal feedback and dynamic feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 91.5% accuracy on the MAP dataset, surpassing GPT-4V (89.2%) and others.

Conclusion: CIMR's iterative reasoning and self-correction significantly improve performance in complex multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

*Eman Ali,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework for CLIP improves unsupervised adaptation by integrating prototype and neighborhood-based consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pseudo-labels from zero-shot predictions in CLIP are noisy under domain shifts or complex visuals, and fixed confidence thresholds are unreliable in unsupervised settings.

Method: Proposes PICS (assesses pseudo-label accuracy via feature compactness/separation) and NALR (refines labels using neighborhood semantic similarities), with adaptive weighting for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 benchmarks, providing more accurate pseudo-labels efficiently.

Conclusion: The framework enhances CLIP's adaptation by dynamically refining pseudo-labels, proving effective in unsupervised scenarios.

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mohammad Abdul Hafeez Khan,Yash Jain,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A closed-loop framework (TIR) refines prompts iteratively using a pretrained MLLM to improve text-to-image generation alignment without retraining the T2I model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address prompt sensitivity in T2I models, where minor wording changes cause inconsistent outputs.

Method: Iterative refinement: MLLM analyzes output images and prompts, detects misalignments, and refines prompts for next generation.

Result: Improved alignment and visual coherence across benchmark datasets, with plug-and-play compatibility.

Conclusion: TIR effectively mirrors human iterative refinement, enhancing T2I model outputs without additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares Bayesian optimization (BO) and multi-fidelity BO (MFBO) for optimizing energy absorption in spinodoid structures, showing MFBO outperforms BO by up to 11%. It also introduces Sobol' sampling and sensitivity analysis to improve data-driven design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of finite element simulations and the lack of direct comparison between BO and MFBO in real-world engineering problems like metamaterial design.

Method: Uses Sobol' sampling for variance-based sensitivity analysis to reduce design complexity and compares BO and MFBO for optimizing energy absorption in spinodoid structures.

Result: MFBO outperforms BO by up to 11% in maximizing energy absorption, demonstrating its effectiveness for expensive data-driven design problems.

Conclusion: MFBO is a superior method for optimizing expensive simulations, and the open-source results support its broader utility in data-driven design.

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

*Sergii Kavun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel hybrid activation functions, S3 and S4, addressing issues like dead neurons and vanishing gradients. S4 outperforms baselines in accuracy, convergence, and gradient stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) have limitations like dead neurons and vanishing gradients, hindering neural network performance.

Method: S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs and softsign for positive inputs, while S4 adds a smooth transition mechanism with a parameter k. Experiments were conducted on classification and regression tasks.

Result: S4 achieved 97.4% accuracy on MNIST, 96.0% on Iris, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing, with faster convergence and stable gradients.

Conclusion: Hybrid activation functions like S4, with tunable parameters, offer a promising solution for improving neural network training dynamics.

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for
improving neural network training dynamics.

### [25] [Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning for Network Routing with Non-Markovian Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22174)
*Molly Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a spatial-temporal RL method using GNNs and RNNs to improve packet routing in dynamic networks, outperforming traditional RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL and MDP frameworks fail in non-Markovian scenarios and lack spatial awareness for complex network topologies.

Method: Integrates GNNs for spatial dynamics and RNNs for temporal patterns to enhance routing decisions.

Result: Outperforms and is more robust to topology changes than traditional RL.

Conclusion: The spatial-temporal RL approach is effective for dynamic network routing.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

*Ambarish Singh,Romila Pradhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SourceGrasp and SourceSplice to select optimal data sources for ML tasks, improving downstream model performance with fewer explorations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data discovery methods ignore source quality for ML performance, creating a gap in selecting the best data sources for training.

Method: Proposes SourceGrasp (metaheuristic with greediness and randomization) and SourceSplice (inspired by gene splicing) for efficient source selection.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows SourceSplice identifies high-utility subsets with fewer explorations, outperforming on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: SourceSplice effectively selects data sources for ML tasks, demonstrating robustness across various settings.

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and interpretable eGFR prediction is crucial for CKD management, but existing LMMs face deployment, privacy, and reliability issues.

Method: The framework uses visual knowledge transfer, abductive reasoning, and short-term memory to boost LMM performance and interpretability.

Result: The framework matches proprietary models in predictive performance and interpretability, offering clinically meaningful explanations.

Conclusion: The study advances AI in healthcare by balancing predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

TL;DR: A distribution-based method using Wasserstein distance measures time-series dataset similarity, aiding model selection and finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to measure time-series dataset similarity for tasks like model selection, finetuning, and visualization.

Method: Proposes using Wasserstein distance between multivariate normal distributions representing time-series datasets.

Result: Effective in identifying similar datasets and estimating foundation model performance, with high correlation (>0.60) to inference loss.

Conclusion: The Wasserstein distance-based method is effective for measuring time-series dataset similarity and supports foundation model evaluation.

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote fetal monitoring systems lack interpretability, making raw CTG data hard for expectant parents to understand.

Method: CTG-Insight uses a multi-agent LLM system to analyze CTG traces by decomposing them into five medical features (baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, sinusoidal pattern) and synthesizing results with a final agent.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score (97.8%) on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset, outperforming deep learning and single-agent LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides an interpretable and extensible solution for CTG analysis, enhancing transparency in fetal health monitoring.

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work

Conclusion: Machine learning models, combined with SHAP, enhance midterm load forecasting for power systems.

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric
power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather
variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential
for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), for forecasting system-wide electricity load up to one year in
advance. Midterm forecasting has shown to be crucial for maintenance
scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market
participation. The paper places a focus on the use of a method called "Shapley

TL;DR: TRIBE is a multimodal deep neural network that predicts brain responses across modalities, cortical areas, and individuals, outperforming unimodal models and winning the Algonauts 2025 competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuroscience's fragmented approach hinders unified cognition models; TRIBE aims to integrate multimodal brain responses.

Method: Combines pretrained text, audio, and video models with a transformer to model fMRI responses to videos.

Result: Achieved top performance in Algonauts 2025, excelling in high-level associative cortices.

Conclusion: TRIBE advances integrative brain modeling, with potential for broader cognitive applications.

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction in foundation model training by estimating data source quality and resource allocation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of point estimates in data scaling decisions and improve cost-effective resource allocation for domain specialization.

Method: Extends point estimate approaches by performing multiple annealing runs to estimate scaling laws for data sources, analyzing performance gains relative to costs.

Result: Validated on a 7B-parameter model, showing scaling behaviors vary by data source, enabling better decisions than point estimates.

Conclusion: The framework enables data-driven optimization of data sources for domain specialization, outperforming traditional micro-annealing techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables

*Hanqi Zhou,Fryderyk Mantiuk,David G. Nagy,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces representational empowerment, shifting focus from external control to internal knowledge adaptability for general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI focuses on external objectives, leading to specialized but inflexible agents. The paper aims to address this by prioritizing internal knowledge control.

Method: Proposes representational empowerment, measuring an agent's ability to maintain and diversify its internal knowledge structures.

Result: Suggests that internal representation control enhances adaptability and preparedness, distinct from direct environmental influence.

Conclusion: Representational empowerment offers a new paradigm for designing adaptable intelligent systems by focusing on internal knowledge structures.

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: W-CFM improves CFM by weighting training pairs with a Gibbs kernel, enhancing efficiency and performance without costly mini-batch OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CFM produces inefficient paths, requiring fine discretization. Recent methods use costly mini-batch OT, prompting a need for a more efficient solution.

Method: W-CFM modifies CFM loss by weighting pairs with a Gibbs kernel, approximating entropic OT coupling while maintaining marginal distributions.

Result: W-CFM matches or outperforms baselines in sample quality, fidelity, and diversity, retaining CFM's computational efficiency.

Conclusion: W-CFM offers a computationally efficient alternative to mini-batch OT methods, improving CFM performance without added cost.

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

### [35] [Comparing Cluster-Based Cross-Validation Strategies for Machine Learning Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22299)
*Afonso Martini Spezia,Mariana Recamonde-Mendoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates cluster-based cross-validation strategies, proposing a new technique combining Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification. It compares methods on bias, variance, and computational cost, finding the new method effective for balanced datasets but favoring traditional stratified cross-validation for imbalanced ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential bias in cross-validation due to unrepresentative data folds and improve model evaluation strategies.

Method: Proposes a new cross-validation technique using Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification and compares it with other methods on 20 datasets using four supervised learning algorithms.

Result: The new technique outperformed others on balanced datasets but traditional stratified cross-validation was better for imbalanced ones. No single clustering algorithm consistently stood out.

Conclusion: The work enhances understanding of cluster-based cross-validation and reaffirms the value of stratified cross-validation, especially for imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

*Romulo B. da Silva,Cássio M. Oishi,Diego Passos,J. Nathan Kutz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CS-SHRED integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) for robust spatiotemporal data reconstruction, outperforming traditional SHRED with higher fidelity and noise resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reconstructing spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete, compressed, or corrupted data, especially in scenarios with sparse sensors, noise, and incomplete acquisitions.

Method: Combines CS techniques with SHRED, using a batch-based forward framework with ℓ1 regularization and an adaptive loss function (MSE, MAE, and SNR regularization).

Result: Achieves higher reconstruction fidelity (improved SSIM, PSNR, lower errors, better LPIPS scores) in tasks like fluid flows, humidity fields, and turbulent flows.

Conclusion: CS-SHRED's joint CS and SHRED design, with an SNR-guided adaptive loss, is a powerful tool for environmental, climatic, and scientific data analysis.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

TL;DR: MH-pFedHN and MH-pFedHNGD are hypernetwork-based frameworks for heterogeneous personalized federated learning, enhancing privacy and scalability without external data or model disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing methods that rely on external data, model decoupling, or partial learning, which hinder practicality and scalability.

Method: Uses a server-side hypernetwork with client-specific embeddings to generate personalized parameters, incorporating a multi-head structure for shared knowledge and optional global model integration.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and strong generalization across benchmarks, proving effective for model-heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: The frameworks offer a robust, privacy-preserving solution for personalized federated learning, serving as a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable deep learning framework (ParaSDM) is proposed for parametrized sequential decision-making, integrating the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model (SPN) to solve NP-hard FLPO problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of NP-hard Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO) problems, which involve mixed discrete-continuous structures and non-convex objectives.

Method: Combines MEP with the Shortest Path Network (SPN), a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder, for efficient gradient-based optimization over shared parameters.

Result: SPN achieves 100x speedup in policy inference and gradient computation, with a 6% optimality gap, and outperforms metaheuristic baselines by 10x in cost reduction. Matches Gurobi's optimal cost at 1500x speedup.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of structured deep models for large-scale mixed-integer optimization, setting a new state of the art for ParaSDM problems.

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

*Seokho Han,Seoyeon Yoon,Jinhee Kim,Dongwei Wang,Kang Eun Jeon,Huanrui Yang,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSQ is a memory-efficient bit sparsification quantization method for DNNs, reducing parameters and training time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing DNN efficiency for mobile/edge devices, addressing challenges in mixed-precision quantization and bit-level sparsity methods.

Method: Uses a round-clamp quantizer for differentiable LSB computation, regularization for sparsity, and Hessian information for pruning multiple LSBs.

Result: Achieves 8.00x parameter reduction, 86% training time reduction, and competitive accuracy/compression.

Conclusion: MSQ is a practical solution for efficient DNN training on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and unique characteristics of ST ocean data hinder model design and training, and a lack of comprehensive surveys impedes progress in ocean data mining.

Method: Review of ST ocean datasets, quality enhancement techniques, and classification of STDM tasks (prediction, event detection, pattern mining, anomaly detection).

Result: Identifies key techniques and open challenges in STDM for ocean science.

Conclusion: The survey aids computer and ocean scientists in understanding STDM concepts, techniques, and challenges for ocean science.

Abstract: With the rapid amassing of spatial-temporal (ST) ocean data, many
spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address
various oceanic issues, including climate forecasting and disaster warning.
Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more
complicated but with unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high
sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM
models on ST ocean data. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of existing studies remains missing in the literature, which hinders not only
computer scientists from identifying the research issues in ocean data mining
but also ocean scientists to apply advanced STDM techniques. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey of existing STDM studies for ocean science.
Concretely, we first review the widely-used ST ocean datasets and highlight
their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement
techniques are explored. Next, we classify existing STDM studies in ocean
science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern
mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate on the techniques for these tasks.
Finally, promising research opportunities are discussed. This survey can help
scientists from both computer science and ocean science better understand the
fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM for ocean
science.

TL;DR: Spec-VLA accelerates Vision-Language-Action models using speculative decoding, improving speed by 1.42x without compromising success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models face computational inefficiency due to large parameter sizes and autoregressive decoding. Speculative decoding, effective for LLMs, is unexplored for VLAs.

Method: Introduces Spec-VLA, a framework using speculative decoding with a relaxed acceptance mechanism based on action token distances.

Result: Achieves 1.42x speedup over OpenVLA, with 44% longer acceptance lengths, maintaining success rates.

Conclusion: Spec-VLA demonstrates speculative execution's potential for VLA models, offering significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Motivation: To address overestimation issues in gradient-based attacks caused by floating-point computation errors.

Method: Theoretical analysis of floating-point errors in four attack scenarios, leading to the proposal of T-MIFPE loss with an optimal scaling factor.

Result: T-MIFPE outperforms CE, C&W, DLR, and MIFPE in attack potency and robustness evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: T-MIFPE effectively minimizes floating-point errors, improving attack accuracy and robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss

TL;DR: RANA is a robust active learning framework for network alignment that addresses structural and labeling noise, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing network alignment methods overlook noise issues (structural and labeling noise), which degrade performance.

Method: RANA introduces a Noise-aware Selection Module for structural noise and a Label Denoising Module for labeling noise, using cleanliness scores and multi-source fusion denoising.

Result: RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active learning methods in alignment accuracy on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RANA effectively tackles noise in network alignment, enhancing robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces RCR-AF, a novel activation function combining GELU and ReLU advantages, to enhance neural network robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in safety-critical applications, prompting exploration of activation functions for improved robustness.

Method: Proposes RCR-AF, which integrates GELU's smoothness and ReLU's monotonicity, with hyperparameters controlling sparsity and capacity via Rademacher complexity.

Result: RCR-AF outperforms ReLU, GELU, and Swish in clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, validated through theoretical and empirical analysis.

Conclusion: RCR-AF offers a principled, effective solution to enhance model robustness, bridging gaps in current activation functions.

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in VFL (intra-party and inter-party) causes feature representation issues and model bias, hindering collaborative learning.

Method: Introduces class prototypes, probabilistic dual prototype learning, mixed prior guidance, and adaptive gated feature aggregation to dynamically handle unaligned samples and mitigate imbalance.

Result: Proto-EVFL achieves a convergence rate of 1/√T and outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%, even in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL effectively addresses class imbalance in VFL, enhancing feature representation and model performance through innovative dual prototypes and adaptive strategies.

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods treat all data equally, making it hard to forget certain data. The paper addresses this by leveraging loss to reflect unlearning difficulty.

Method: Proposes Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during unlearning with minimal overhead.

Result: LoReUn reduces the gap between existing methods and exact unlearning, improving prevention of harmful content in text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: LoReUn is a simple yet effective solution for enhancing machine unlearning, particularly for harmful content.

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends forecast reconciliation to nonlinear contexts, providing formal theorems for error reduction and releasing a Python package for implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of formal theorems for error reduction in nonlinear forecast reconciliation, extending prior work.

Method: Derive theorems for nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions, including cases with constant-sign and non-constant-sign curvature.

Result: Exact analog of a prior theorem for constant-sign curvature and probabilistic guarantees for broader cases.

Conclusion: The paper fills a theoretical gap and supports practical adoption with a JAX-based Python package.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces domain-specific pretraining tasks for molecular property prediction using SMILES strings, improving performance and efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance molecular property prediction by leveraging advances in NLP and transformer models, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Proposes novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks for SMILES strings, using transformer models, and evaluates through ablation studies.

Result: Outperforms traditional likelihood-based training and prior fine-tuning tasks in six benchmarks, with improved data and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining enhances molecular property prediction, offering comparable performance to fine-tuning with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower
computational overhead.

Motivation: To improve prediction accuracy and stability in event sequence tasks, especially for unbalanced datasets, using GCN architectures.

Method: Four GCN architectures (O-GCN, T-GCN, TP-GCN, TE-GCN) with varied node/graph attributes and temporal dependencies via edge weights.

Result: GCNConv models excel on unbalanced data; all models perform well on balanced data. HGCN(O) outperforms traditional methods.

Conclusion: HGCN(O) is effective for event sequence prediction, with applications like Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM).

Abstract: We propose HGCN(O), a self-tuning toolkit using Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) models for event sequence prediction. Featuring four GCN architectures
(O-GCN, T-GCN, TP-GCN, TE-GCN) across the GCNConv and GraphConv layers, our
toolkit integrates multiple graph representations of event sequences with
different choices of node- and graph-level attributes and in temporal
dependencies via edge weights, optimising prediction accuracy and stability for
balanced and unbalanced datasets. Extensive experiments show that GCNConv
models excel on unbalanced data, while all models perform consistently on
balanced data. Experiments also confirm the superior performance of HGCN(O)
over traditional approaches. Applications include Predictive Business Process
Monitoring (PBPM), which predicts future events or states of a business process
based on event logs.

### [52] [FGFP: A Fractional Gaussian Filter and Pruning for Deep Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22527)
*Kuan-Ting Tu,Po-Hsien Yu,Yu-Syuan Tseng,Shao-Yi Chien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the FGFP framework, combining fractional Gaussian filters and adaptive pruning to compress DNNs for edge devices, achieving high accuracy with significant model size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are computationally heavy for edge devices, and existing compression methods struggle with deployment. The goal is to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The FGFP framework uses fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs) with Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives for efficiency and integrates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) for higher compression.

Result: On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 saw a 1.52% accuracy drop with 85.2% size reduction. On ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 had a 1.63% drop with 69.1% reduction.

Conclusion: FGFP effectively compresses DNNs for edge devices, outperforming recent methods in accuracy and compression.

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size
by 69.1%.

TL;DR: A robust framework using AutoML-enhanced DEC and Bayesian Networks predicts accident-induced congestion with 95.6% accuracy, validated via SUMO simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address traffic congestion caused by accidents, which leads to delays, emissions, and safety issues.

Method: AutoML-enhanced Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC) for labeling and Bayesian Networks (BN) for congestion prediction, validated with SUMO simulations.

Result: AutoML-enhanced DEC outperforms traditional methods; BN achieves 95.6% accuracy and closely matches SUMO simulation results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework reliably predicts congestion from accidents, enhancing urban mobility.

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

*Yanjin He,Qingkai Zeng,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Zipf's law to determine optimal vocabulary size in tokenization, showing improved model performance when token distributions align with power-law behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for selecting vocabulary size in tokenization rely on heuristics or dataset-specific choices, lacking a principled approach.

Method: Analyze token frequency distributions using Zipf's law to align vocabulary size with power-law behavior.

Result: Models achieve peak performance when token distributions closely follow Zipf's law, validated across NLP, genomics, and chemistry.

Conclusion: Zipfian alignment is a robust and generalizable criterion for selecting vocabulary size, enhancing model efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of ONNs, traditionally used for combinatorial optimization, in solving linear algebra problems like matrix inversion, leveraging thermodynamic principles.

Method: The linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator model is analytically shown to yield the inverse matrix solution, with numerical simulations validating the approach.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical framework, identifying parameter regimes where computation accuracy is highest.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of ONNs for solving linear algebra problems, expanding their application beyond combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: We describe a thermodynamic-inspired computing paradigm based on oscillatory
neural networks (ONNs). While ONNs have been widely studied as Ising machines
for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems, this work
investigates their feasibility in solving linear algebra problems, specifically
the inverse matrix. Grounded in thermodynamic principles, we analytically
demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator
model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the
theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation
has the highest accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepC4, a deep learning method for spatial disaggregation, improving urban morphology mapping in Rwanda by integrating census data and satellite imagery, outperforming existing techniques like GEM and METEOR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing discrepancies and uncertainties in coarse-to-fine-grained urban mapping, particularly in developing economies, to enhance disaster risk reduction and sustainable development efforts.

Method: Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a deep learning approach that uses census statistics as constraints and multitask learning for satellite imagery analysis.

Result: Improved mapping quality for Rwandan urban morphology, specifically building exposure and vulnerability, at a detailed administrative level.

Conclusion: DeepC4 offers a scalable, accurate solution for large-scale spatial auditing, supporting global sustainability and disaster risk frameworks by 2030.

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in
2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards
a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large
scales.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAR, a visualization solution for comparing closely matched ML models in the Rashomon set, aiding developers in identifying optimal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple ML models with similar accuracies but different structures.

Method: VAR combines heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize and compare models within the Rashomon set.

Result: VAR enables developers to identify optimal models under specific conditions and understand the Rashomon set's characteristics.

Conclusion: VAR provides an effective tool for analyzing and comparing closely matched ML models, enhancing model selection and understanding.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

*Afshin Khadangi,Amir Sartipi,Igor Tchappi,Ramin Bahmani,Gilbert Fridgen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLDP is a reinforcement learning framework for differentially private optimization, improving model utility and efficiency while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between data privacy and model utility in LLMs, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, is a critical challenge. Existing DP-SGD methods are rigid and inefficient.

Method: RLDP uses deep reinforcement learning (SAC) to dynamically adjust per-parameter gradient-clipping thresholds and noise injection during training, optimizing privacy budget allocation.

Result: RLDP reduces perplexity by 1.3-30.5% and improves downstream utility by 5.6% on average, achieving baseline performance with 13-43% fewer gradient updates.

Conclusion: RLDP effectively balances privacy and utility, outperforming traditional DP-SGD methods while adhering to the same privacy guarantees.

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning and XAI approach is used to derive human-interpretable rules for classifying monotone matrices, identifying key polynomial coefficients as criteria with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of easy characterizations for monotone matrices, despite their simple definition, by leveraging machine learning.

Method: Combines deep neural networks with XAI techniques on a dataset of randomly generated matrices to identify classification criteria.

Result: Identifies two characteristic polynomial coefficients as sufficient for classification with 95% accuracy, leading to a simple bound for monotone matrices.

Conclusion: The study successfully derives a practical, interpretable criterion for monotone matrices, demonstrating the potential of ML in abstract algebra.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

TL;DR: HHFFT addresses hybrid heterogeneity in federated fine-tuning with H2Tune, tackling dimensional mismatches and multi-task interference via sparsified decomposition, layer alignment, and knowledge disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FFT methods fail in scenarios with double heterogeneity in model architectures and tasks, necessitating solutions for heterogeneous matrix aggregation and multi-task knowledge interference.

Method: H2Tune uses sparsified triple matrix decomposition, relation-guided layer alignment, and alternating task-knowledge disentanglement to handle hybrid heterogeneity.

Result: Achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement over baselines with a proven convergence rate of O(1/√T).

Conclusion: H2Tune effectively addresses hybrid heterogeneity challenges in federated fine-tuning, demonstrating superior performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven approach using deep neural networks to predict cell division plane positioning from cell geometry, outperforming traditional geometric rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hypothesis-driven methods rely on predefined geometric rules, limiting their flexibility. A data-based approach can better capture complex relationships.

Method: A modified UNet architecture is used to learn and predict division patterns from cell geometry, tested on synthetic and A. thaliana embryo cells.

Result: The model successfully predicts division patterns that existing geometric rules could not explain, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: Deep networks offer a powerful tool for understanding cell division and generating new hypotheses about its control.

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian Optimization-based method for optimizing and adjusting process parameters in sensor-based sorting systems, minimizing experiments while addressing uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous verification and re-adjustment of process parameters in sensor-based sorting systems are needed due to changing requirements and material compositions.

Method: Uses Gaussian process regression models as surrogate models within Bayesian Optimization to optimize process parameters, considering uncertainties and dual optimization targets.

Result: The method was evaluated with three example process parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing experiments while meeting sorting accuracy requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently optimizes and adjusts process parameters in sensor-based sorting systems, addressing uncertainties and reducing experimental needs.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Jacobian-based regularizer improves symbolic distillation of neural networks, boosting fidelity by 120% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current symbolic distillation of neural networks is brittle due to complex functions, leading to low-fidelity student models.

Method: Introduces a Jacobian-based regularizer to encourage smoother, more distillable functions in the teacher network.

Result: Improves the R² score of distilled symbolic models by 120% (relative) on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enhances interpretable model fidelity from neural networks without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address dataset shift in transductive learning, where traditional model selection methods fail due to non-IID data.

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

TL;DR: G-Core is a scalable RLHF training framework addressing challenges like controller scalability and resource placement in dynamic workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF systems struggle with scalability and efficiency in multi-modal and dynamic workflows.

Method: G-Core introduces a parallel controller model and dynamic resource placement for efficient orchestration.

Result: G-Core successfully trained models for WeChat, improving hardware utilization and scalability.

Conclusion: G-Core advances RLHF training, offering a robust solution for large-scale human-aligned models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

*Max Sondag,Christofer Meinecke,Dennis Collaris,Tatiana von Landesberger,Stef van den Elzen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a visualization system to improve the interpretability of random forests by clustering similar trees and using new distance metrics and visualization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random forests, while powerful, are hard to interpret due to their complexity. This work aims to make them more understandable without oversimplifying.

Method: The authors propose clustering trees using a new distance metric and introduce two visualization methods: Feature Plot and Rule Plot.

Result: The approach is validated on the "Glass" dataset and through a user study, showing improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively enhances the interpretability of random forests, making them more accessible for analysis.

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

*Zijing Zhang,Ziyang Chen,Mingxiao Li,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVMR integrates process-level supervision into RL to improve reasoning quality, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods reinforce flawed reasoning paths, leading to brittle agents. RLVMR aims to address this by rewarding verifiable meta-reasoning behaviors.

Method: RLVMR uses dense, process-level supervision, tagging cognitive steps and providing rule-based rewards for effective problem-solving, combined with outcome signals.

Result: Achieves 83.6% success rate on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, with improved reasoning quality and reduced redundant actions.

Conclusion: RLVMR produces more robust, efficient, and interpretable agents by enhancing reasoning processes.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

*Filippo Utro,Meltem Tolunay,Kahn Rhrissorrakrai,Tanvi P. Gujarati,Jie Shi,Sara Capponi,Mirko Amico,Nate Earnest-Noble,Laxmi Parida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum approach (Projected Quantum Kernel) to improve CAR T-cell cytotoxicity prediction, outperforming classical methods in data-constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combinatorial space of CAR T-cell co-stimulatory domains is vast and undersampled, making experimental testing challenging.

Method: A quantum method (PQK) embeds classical data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space and uses kernel methods for similarity measurement, tested on a 61-qubit quantum computer.

Result: PQK enhances classification performance over classical methods, especially for low-information signaling domains and positions.

Conclusion: Quantum computing shows promise for data-constrained problems like CAR T-cell engineering.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

*Andris Ambainis,Joao F. Doriguello,Debbie Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning MDPs, leveraging hybrid exploration-generative RL and quantum advantages for improved regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve regret bounds in RL for MDPs by avoiding traditional paradigms like optimism and posterior sampling, and leveraging quantum algorithms for better performance.

Method: Hybrid exploration-generative RL model with simulator access, employing classical and quantum algorithms to approximate optimal policies directly.

Result: Quantum algorithms achieve logarithmic regret in finite-horizon MDPs and poly-logarithmic regret in infinite-horizon MDPs, outperforming classical bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms, especially quantum ones, significantly improve regret bounds and generalize to compact state spaces.

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to estimate the full confusion matrix for performance monitoring of image classification models, particularly in clinical settings with class imbalances and dataset shifts. It benchmarks these methods on chest x-ray data, revealing limitations of current techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct assessment of model performance in real-world clinical settings is challenging due to unavailable ground-truth labels. Existing methods focus on accuracy estimation and lack evaluation in clinical domains with imbalances and shifts.

Method: The paper generalizes existing performance prediction methods to estimate the full confusion matrix. It evaluates these methods on chest x-ray data under real-world and simulated distribution shifts.

Result: The proposed methods reliably predicted clinically relevant metrics under distribution shifts but exposed failure modes of current techniques in simulated scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for better understanding of real-world deployment contexts when implementing performance monitoring for medical AI models.

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

### [71] [DO-EM: Density Operator Expectation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22786)
*Adit Vishnu,Abhay Shastry,Dhruva Kashyap,Chiranjib Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework for training latent variable models using density operators (DOMs) on classical hardware, addressing scalability issues in quantum-inspired machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum-inspired training algorithms, like those for Quantum Boltzmann Machines, fail to scale to real-world datasets (e.g., MNIST). The EM algorithm's success in classical probabilistic models motivates its adaptation for DOMs.

Method: The authors reformulate the EM algorithm's Expectation step as a quantum information projection (QIP) problem, solved using the Petz Recovery Map. They introduce the Density Operator EM (DO-EM) algorithm, optimizing a quantum evidence lower bound.

Result: The DO-EM algorithm ensures non-decreasing log-likelihood and scales to real-world data. Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (QiDBMs), trained with DO-EM, outperform classical DBMs on MNIST, reducing Fréchet Inception Distance by 40–60%.

Conclusion: The proposed DO-EM framework enables scalable training of DOMs on classical hardware, bridging the gap between quantum-inspired models and practical applications in machine learning.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using foundation models identifies key tokens and events in EHRs, improving anomaly detection and prediction of patient outcomes while enabling data reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the identification of significant events in EHRs beyond rule-based methods, leveraging context for better anomaly detection and outcome prediction.

Method: Uses foundation models to analyze EHR data in full hospitalization context, flagging anomalous events and assessing token informativeness.

Result: Flags significant events for outcome prediction, allows safe dropping of low-information events, and aids in interpreting prognostic models.

Conclusion: The approach improves EHR analysis by combining context-aware anomaly detection with data efficiency and model interpretability.

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative
tokens and events in electronic health records. Our approach considers incoming
data in the entire context of a patient's hospitalization and so can flag
anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal
range. We demonstrate that the events our model flags are significant for
predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified
as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained
on foundation model-derived representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover interpretable patterns in neural networks and demonstrate their reliance on learned features.

Method: Formally describe the implicit linear model and modify the backward pass to pull its decision boundary back to input space, generating excitation pullbacks.

Result: Excitation pullbacks reveal high-resolution, perceptually aligned features in ImageNet-pretrained architectures.

Conclusion: Neural networks rely on interpretable patterns, recoverable post-training, with implications for knowledge discovery and dependable AI.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

TL;DR: PAF-Net is a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework addressing challenges in multi-process manufacturing, outperforming baselines with lower MSE and MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is hindered by time-lagged interactions, overlapping operations, and inter-process dependencies.

Method: PAF-Net uses phase-correlation alignment, frequency-independent patch attention, and frequency-decoupled cross attention to address these challenges.

Result: PAF-Net achieves 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88% lower MAE than 10 baselines on 4 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: PAF-Net effectively resolves manufacturing prediction challenges, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%
lower MAE. Our code is available at

TL;DR: A decentralized, differentially private power method (D-DP-PM) for PCA in networked multi-agent settings, ensuring privacy and collaborative eigenvector estimation without a central aggregator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of PCA in scenarios where agents observe only subsets of dimensions, ensuring privacy and collaboration without centralized control.

Method: Agents share local embeddings of eigenvectors with Gaussian noise, leveraging random initialization and network topology for privacy and convergence.

Result: Proves (ε,δ)-DP guarantee, provides tight bounds on privacy and utility, and shows superior tradeoffs in moderate privacy regimes.

Conclusion: D-DP-PM offers efficient, privacy-preserving PCA with strong performance in networked settings.

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Motivation: The proliferation of LLM-powered agents in high-stakes domains necessitates verifiability and compliance as core design constraints.

Method: Introduces TrustTrack, a protocol with structural guarantees like verifiable identity and tamper-resistant logs, integrating compliance into agent infrastructure.

Result: Enables trust-native autonomy, reframing agent operations across organizations and jurisdictions with demonstrated use cases in regulated domains.

Conclusion: TrustTrack represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems, transitioning from Cloud to AI to Agent to Trust.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in
high-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge
is no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a
protocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy
commitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent
infrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By
treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,
TrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and
jurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use
cases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and
AI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust
transition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces successor features for knowledge transfer in games, proposing the GGPI algorithm to enable value and policy transfer across tasks, with demonstrated success in a pursuer-evader game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on task similarity for knowledge transfer, which fails when tasks differ. Successor features offer a solution for more robust transfer.

Method: The paper presents the GGPI algorithm for Markov games, deriving an error bound for transfer based on task similarity.

Result: GGPI achieves high-reward interactions, one-shot policy transfer, and outperforms baselines in success rates and path efficiency.

Conclusion: Successor features and GGPI provide effective knowledge transfer in games, even with task differences.

Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum,
complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent
systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for
agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge
transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which
heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to
failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper
presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel
algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to
address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed
algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An
upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity
of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we
demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and
one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial
conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path
efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.

Motivation: Enhancing interaction and prediction accuracy in autonomous multi-agent systems is crucial for system capabilities.

Method: Uses EvolveGCN for dynamic graph modeling and incorporates physics-constrained loss functions based on Clohessy-Wiltshire equations.

Result: Improved reliability and accuracy of future state estimations in multi-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines dynamic graphs and physics constraints for better predictions in autonomous systems.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of autonomous systems, interaction among
agents within a shared environment is both inevitable and essential for
enhancing overall system capabilities. A key requirement in such multi-agent
systems is the ability of each agent to reliably predict the future positions
of its nearest neighbors. Traditionally, graphs and graph theory have served as
effective tools for modeling inter agent communication and relationships. While
this approach is widely used, the present work proposes a novel method that
leverages dynamic graphs in a forward looking manner. Specifically, the
employment of EvolveGCN, a dynamic graph convolutional network, to forecast the
evolution of inter-agent relationships over time. To improve prediction
accuracy and ensure physical plausibility, this research incorporates physics
constrained loss functions based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of motion.
This integrated approach enhances the reliability of future state estimations
in multi-agent scenarios.

Motivation: Existing MAPF solvers lack handling for uncertain behavior of uncontrollable agents, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments.

Method: Combines a learned predictor for uncontrollable agents' movement, conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification, and a modified ECBS solver.

Result: CP-Solver achieves competitive throughput and reduced collisions in warehouse and game maps, with statistical guarantees for one-shot missions.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses uncertainty in MAPF, scaling to lifelong missions while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Existing multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers do not account for uncertain
behavior of uncontrollable agents. We present a novel variant of Enhanced
Conflict-Based Search (ECBS), for both one-shot and lifelong MAPF in dynamic
environments with uncontrollable agents. Our method consists of (1) training a
learned predictor for the movement of uncontrollable agents, (2) quantifying
the prediction error using conformal prediction (CP), a tool for statistical
uncertainty quantification, and (3) integrating these uncertainty intervals
into our modified ECBS solver. Our method can account for uncertain agent
behavior, comes with statistical guarantees on collision-free paths for
one-shot missions, and scales to lifelong missions with a receding horizon
sequence of one-shot instances. We run our algorithm, CP-Solver, across
