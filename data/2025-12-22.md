### [1] [Navigating Taxonomic Expansions of Entity Sets Driven by Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16953)
*Pietro Cofone,Giovanni Amendola,Marco Manna,Aldo Ricioppo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces logic-based expansion graphs for entity set expansion, formalizes reasoning tasks to compare entities without full graph construction, and shows efficient implementation under realistic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity set expansion typically follows a linear approach, which fails to capture taxonomic structures in knowledge resources, and full materialization of expansion graphs may be impractical due to large sizes.

Method: A logic-based framework with expansion graphs (rooted directed acyclic graphs) is used, where nodes represent semantic generalizations with logical formulas, and formal reasoning tasks are defined to check entity tuple relationships in the graph.

Result: Under realistic assumptions like bounding input or limiting entity descriptions, the reasoning tasks can be implemented efficiently, enabling local, incremental graph navigation without full construction.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning tasks allow practical applications of expansion graphs for taxonomic entity set expansion, avoiding the need for full graph materialization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recognizing similarities among entities is central to both human cognition and computational intelligence. Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.

TL;DR: Presents a framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI) with a benchmark revealing significant gaps in current LLMs' scientific capabilities across research, experimentation, and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in scientific AI, a coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)—the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains—remains lacking.

Method: We introduce an operational SGI definition grounded in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM): Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception. We operationalize SGI via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, dry/wet experiments, and experimental reasoning. We create SGI-Bench with over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions. We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference.

Result: Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10–20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. TTRL enhances hypothesis novelty without reference answer.

Conclusion: We have established a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery through our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights.

### [3] [PAACE: A Plan-Aware Automated Agent Context Engineering Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16970)
*Kamer Ali Yuksel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering) optimizes LLM agent states through plan-aware compression, improving accuracy while drastically lowering computational overhead, with distilled models cutting costs by over 10×.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents generate rapidly expanding contexts that need curation, transformation, and compression to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference costs. Existing summarization and compression methods ignore the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning.

Method: PAACE comprises two components: PAACE-Syn (large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows with compression supervision) and PAACE-FT (family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from teacher demonstrations).

Result: Experiments show PAACE improves agent correctness while reducing context load: higher accuracy on AppWorld, improved accuracy/F1 on OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. Distilled PAACE-FT retains 97% of teacher performance while reducing inference cost over 10×.

Conclusion: PAACE enables practical deployment of plan-aware compression with compact models, achieving high accuracy while significantly reducing context load and computational costs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in complex, multi-step workflows involving planning, tool use, reflection, and interaction with external knowledge systems. These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. Distilled PAACE-FT retains 97 percent of the teacher's performance while reducing inference cost by over an order of magnitude, enabling practical deployment of plan-aware compression with compact models.

### [4] [Security Risks of Agentic Vehicles: A Systematic Analysis of Cognitive and Cross-Layer Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17041)
*Ali Eslami,Jiangbo Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First security risk framework for Agentic Vehicles addressing both AI-layer vulnerabilities and cross-layer cyber-attacks through role-based architecture and attack-chain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks like OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks are insufficient for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms like vehicles, as they don't account for interactions with perception, communication, and control layers.

Method: The paper introduces a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles (Personal Agent and Driving Strategy Agent) and investigates vulnerabilities through severity matrix and attack-chain analysis.

Result: The framework demonstrates how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior, providing structured analysis of security risks in agentic AI for vehicles.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first structured framework for analyzing security risks in Agentic Vehicles, addressing both OWASP-style AI risks and cross-layer cyber-attacks, with practical implications for current and emerging vehicle platforms.

Abstract: Agentic AI is increasingly being explored and introduced in both manually driven and autonomous vehicles, leading to the notion of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), with capabilities such as memory-based personalization, goal interpretation, strategic reasoning, and tool-mediated assistance. While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they account for interactions with other layers such as perception, communication, and control layers. This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The resulting framework provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in both current and emerging vehicle platforms.

### [5] [UniRel-R1: RL-tuned LLM Reasoning for Knowledge Graph Relational Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17043)
*Yinxu Tang,Chengsong Huang,Jiaxin Huang,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces relation-centric KGQA, a new approach to knowledge graph question answering that focuses on retrieving informative subgraphs showing connections between entities, rather than just single answer entities. To address challenges like overwhelming candidate subgraphs, it proposes UniRel-R1, a framework combining subgraph selection, graph pruning, and LLM fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to identify compact and specific subgraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KGQA traditionally answers entity-centric queries with single entities, but real-world queries often seek to understand relationships between entities. The lack of a relation-centric approach that provides comprehensive semantic connections is a gap.

Method: Proposes UniRel-R1, a unified framework integrating subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and fine-tuning an LLM with reinforcement learning. The reward function prioritizes compact, specific subgraphs with informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward compared to Vanilla baselines, and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.

Conclusion: Relation-centric KGQA, enabled by UniRel-R1, addresses relational queries by retrieving informative subgraphs, overcoming challenges of candidate overload through integrated methods and reinforcement learning, with promising experimental results for generalization.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has traditionally focused on entity-centric queries that return a single answer entity. However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.

### [6] [Realistic threat perception drives intergroup conflict: A causal, dynamic analysis using generative-agent simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17066)
*Suhaib Abdurahman,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi,Chenxiao Yu,Nour S. Kteily,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-driven agent simulations in virtual societies reveal that realistic threats directly increase hostility, while symbolic threats only affect hostility indirectly through ingroup bias and only when realistic threats are absent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how realistic/material threats and symbolic threats interact in driving human conflict, addressing limitations of weak causal control and scarce temporal data in real-world studies.

Method: Using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently manipulating realistic and symbolic threats while tracking actions, language, and attitudes.

Result: Realistic threats directly increase hostility; symbolic threats have weaker effects, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and only increase hostility when realistic threats are absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that realist/material threats play a more dominant role in driving conflict directly, while symbolic threats operate indirectly and conditionally, highlighting the importance of threat type distinctions in conflict dynamics.

Abstract: Human conflict is often attributed to threats against material conditions and symbolic values, yet it remains unclear how they interact and which dominates. Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.

### [7] [Value Under Ignorance in Universal Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17086)
*Cole Wyeth,Marcus Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generalization of AIXI agent to handle utility functions with finite history predictions using Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in belief distributions where some hypotheses only predict finite history prefixes (semimeasure loss)

Method: Use Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory to compute expected utilities

Result: Recover standard recursive value function as special case; general expected utilities under death interpretation cannot be characterized as Choquet integrals

Conclusion: Framework extends AIXI to handle utility assignment for finite history predictions using imprecise probability methods

Abstract: We generalize the AIXI reinforcement learning agent to admit a wider class of utility functions. Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case. However, our most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as such Choquet integrals.

### [8] [A Solver-in-the-Loop Framework for Improving LLMs on Answer Set Programming for Logic Puzzle Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17093)
*Timo Pierre Schrader,Lukas Lange,Tobias Kaminski,Simon Razniewski,Annemarie Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach to improve LLM generation of Answer Set Programming code via solver-guided instruction-tuning and supervised fine-tuning, showing consistent improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with generating code for domain-specific languages like Answer Set Programming due to limited training examples, despite their effectiveness in combinatorial problem-solving.

Method: Uses solver feedback to categorize ASP statements into chosen/rejected instances from LLM continuations for logic puzzles, then applies supervised fine-tuning and solver-guided search with best-of-N sampling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in ASP code generation across two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.

Conclusion: The ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach effectively enhances LLM performance for ASP code generation, addressing semantic parsing challenges through targeted fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in coding assistants. While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.

### [9] [Reinforcement Learning for Self-Improving Agent with Skill Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17102)
*Jiongxiao Wang,Qiaojing Yan,Yawei Wang,Yijun Tian,Soumya Smruti Mishra,Zhichao Xu,Megha Gandhi,Panpan Xu,Lin Lee Cheong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes SAGE, an RL framework that enhances LLM agents' self-improvement through skill libraries using Sequential Rollout and Skill-integrated Reward, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle to adapt in new environments; current skill libraries rely on prompting, making consistent implementation challenging.

Method: SAGE framework with Sequential Rollout (iterative agent deployment across task chains) and Skill-integrated Reward to accumulate and reuse skills.

Result: On AppWorld, SAGE improved Scenario Goal Completion by 8.9%, reduced interaction steps by 26%, and token usage by 59% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SAGE enables effective skill accumulation and reuse, significantly outperforming existing methods in adaptability and efficiency for LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions but struggle to continuously improve and adapt when deployed in new environments. One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [10] [Solomonoff-Inspired Hypothesis Ranking with LLMs for Prediction Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17145)
*Josh Barber,Rourke Young,Cameron Coombe,Will Browne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Solomonoff-inspired method is proposed to weight LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit for uncertainty-aware reasoning on Mini-ARC tasks, outperforming Bayesian Model Averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning under uncertainty in AI faces challenges with sparse data, requiring systematic generalization, and existing methods struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple hypotheses.

Method: The method weights hypotheses generated by large language models based on their algorithmic simplicity and predictive fit to data, applied to Mini-ARC benchmark tasks to produce Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions.

Result: The method yields conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even with noisy or partially incorrect hypotheses; compared to Bayesian Model Averaging, it spreads probability more evenly across hypotheses rather than concentrating on the most likely ones.

Conclusion: Algorithmic information-theoretic priors enhance interpretable and reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty, highlighting the method's value for real-world AI tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a key challenge in AI, especially for real-world tasks, where problems with sparse data demands systematic generalisation. Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.

### [11] [MMRAG-RFT: Two-stage Reinforcement Fine-tuning for Explainable Multi-modal Retrieval-augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17194)
*Shengwei Zhao,Jingwen Yao,Sitong Wei,Linhai Xu,Yuying Liu,Dong Zhang,Zhiqiang Tian,Shaoyi Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method to enhance reasoning capabilities and explainability in Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) using a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMRAG methods lack explainability as they fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation.

Method: A two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework: first stage uses rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning for coarse-grained document ranking; second stage uses reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning to jointly optimize fine-grained ranking and answer generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on WebQA and MultimodalQA benchmarks, with effectiveness validated through comprehensive ablation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances reasoning capabilities and achieves explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) enables highly credible generation by integrating external multi-modal knowledge, thus demonstrating impressive performance in complex multi-modal scenarios. However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on WebQA and MultimodalQA, two benchmark datasets for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, and its effectiveness is validated through comprehensive ablation experiments.

### [12] [UmniBench: Unified Understand and Generation Model Oriented Omni-dimensional Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17196)
*Kai Liu,Leyang Chen,Wenbo Li,Zhikai Chen,Zhixin Wang,Renjing Pei,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UmniBench is a comprehensive benchmark for unified multimodal models (UMMs) that evaluates understanding, generation, and editing abilities together or separately across 13 domains and 200+ concepts, assessing 24 popular models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of UMMs are decoupled, assessing understanding and generation separately. There is a need for a unified benchmark to evaluate these abilities comprehensively within a single process.

Method: UmniBench uses human-examined prompts and QA pairs, leveraging the UMM's own understanding ability to evaluate its generation and editing. It covers 13 domains and 200+ concepts for thorough inspection.

Result: The benchmark was applied to 24 popular models, including UMMs and single-ability models, providing a comprehensive and objective assessment of their capabilities.

Conclusion: UmniBench offers a more holistic evaluation framework for UMMs, supporting community model improvement by enabling fine-grained and unified assessment of multimodal abilities.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.

### [13] [Accelerating Multi-modal LLM Gaming Performance via Input Prediction and Mishit Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17250)
*Ziyang Lin,Zixuan Sun,Sanhorn Chen,Xiaoyang Chen,Roy Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A speculation-and-correction framework reduces inference latency in real-time control by generating multiple action plans speculatively and correcting them with learned residual updates, cutting planning steps by ~44% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time sequential control agents are bottlenecked by inference latency, where even small per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade performance, necessitating methods to reduce latency without sacrificing robustness.

Method: Uses TD-MPC2 with a pretrained world model to generate action queues and latent rollouts, then applies a lightweight learned corrector (gated MLP or Transformer) for mismatch between predicted and real latent states, falling back to full replanning only for large mismatches.

Result: On DMC Humanoid-Walk, reduces planning inferences from 500 to 282, cuts step latency by 25%, and maintains control with only 7.1% return reduction; correction is crucial as speculative execution alone is unreliable over longer horizons.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances latency reduction and control robustness through mismatch-aware correction, demonstrating a scalable approach for real-time agents in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time sequential control agents are often bottlenecked by inference latency. Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.

*Miru Hong,Minho Lee,Geonhee Jo,Jae-Hee So,Pascal Bauer,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EventGPT is a player-conditioned transformer model that predicts football match events and evaluates player transfers through counterfactual simulations


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transfer evaluation methods fail to capture how players adapt to new tactical environments and teammates

Method: GPT-style autoregressive transformer treating match play as token sequences, predicting next action type/location/timing and residual On-Ball Value

Result: Outperforms baseline models in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision on Premier League data

Conclusion: Provides principled method for transfer analysis through player embedding substitution and counterfactual simulations

Abstract: Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.

TL;DR: LLMs can play Pokémon battles strategically and create balanced content, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pokémon battles present a unique testbed for evaluating LLMs' strategic reasoning (type matchups, statistical trade-offs, risk assessment) and content generation capabilities, mirroring human strategic thinking.

Method: Developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state (type effectiveness, stat-based damage, team management), then systematically evaluated multiple model architectures on win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency.

Result: LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, demonstrating tactical decision-making and the ability to generate novel, balanced game content.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as both competent tactical players and creative content designers in Pokémon battles, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based games and with implications for procedural content generation and adaptive difficulty systems.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making in Pokémon battles presents a unique testbed for evaluating large language models. Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.

### [16] [Dialectics for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17373)
*Zhengmian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI discovers concepts from raw experience without human labels, using algorithmic information theory to define concepts through structural relations rather than fixed definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human concepts are fluid (e.g., Pluto's planetary status changed), so concepts must be revisable structures tied to experience, not rigid labels.

Method: Proposes an information-theoretic framework: concepts as reversible consistency relations where missing parts are recoverable, with excess information measuring decomposition naturalness. Uses dialectics as optimization dynamics for concept evolution.

Result: A formal system where concepts emerge, split, merge, and align across agents via information compression and transmission protocols.

Conclusion: Provides a computable foundation for concept discovery and alignment, framing communication as a trade-off between computation and bits.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence discover, from raw experience and without human supervision, concepts that humans have discovered? One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of "concept" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents "concepts" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.

### [17] [Translating the Rashomon Effect to Sequential Decision-Making Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17470)
*Dennis Gross,Jørn Eirik Betten,Helge Spieker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the Rashomon effect from classification to sequential decision-making, showing that multiple policies can have identical behavior while differing internally, and demonstrates benefits for robustness and verification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Rashomon effect has been studied in classification but not in sequential decision-making, where verifying identical behavior is more complex due to stochastic transitions.

Method: The authors translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making, define it for policies, and use formal verification methods to compare probabilistic behavior of policies in environments.

Result: Experiments confirm the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. Ensembles from the Rashomon set show greater robustness to distribution shifts, and permissive policies reduce verification computational requirements while maintaining optimal performance.

Conclusion: The Rashomon effect is present and beneficial in sequential decision-making, offering advantages for robustness and efficient verification through policy ensembles and permissive policies.

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the phenomenon where multiple models trained on the same data produce identical predictions while differing in which features they rely on internally. This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in healthcare diagnostics, rising costs, limited specialist access, and the lack of interactivity and transparency in current AI diagnostic systems.

Method: Utilizes GPT-4o with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and explainable AI techniques, incorporating Chain-of-Thought prompting for transparent reasoning and adaptive symptom extraction.

Result: Achieved 90% accuracy and 100% Top-3 accuracy, surpassing traditional models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN.

Conclusion: The LLM-based diagnostic chatbot demonstrates significant potential for improving healthcare diagnostics through enhanced transparency, interactivity, and clinical effectiveness.

Abstract: Healthcare systems around the world are grappling with issues like inefficient diagnostics, rising costs, and limited access to specialists. These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare.

*Anirban Majumdar,Ritam Raha,Rajarshi Roy,David Parker,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Timed Reward Machines (TRMs) to extend reward machines with timing constraints, enabling more expressive reward specifications for time-sensitive RL applications. Proposes model-free RL algorithms with counterfactual-imagining heuristics that learn policies satisfying TRM timing constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward machines cannot model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive reinforcement learning applications.

Method: Extends reward machines to create TRMs with timing constraints. Develops model-free RL frameworks (tabular Q-learning) using timed automata abstractions and counterfactual-imagining heuristics to learn optimal policies under digital and real-time TRM semantics.

Result: Algorithms learn policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying TRM timing constraints on RL benchmarks. Comparative studies show performance differences under TRM semantics, and ablations demonstrate benefits of counterfactual-imagining.

Conclusion: TRMs enable more expressive temporal reward specifications, and the proposed learning framework effectively handles timing constraints in RL tasks through structural exploitation.

Abstract: Reward specification plays a central role in reinforcement learning (RL), guiding the agent's behavior. To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.

*Robin Schimmelpfennig,Mark Díaz,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran,Aida Davani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anthropomorphism in AI is not inherently risky; its effects on engagement and trust are culturally mediated, requiring context-specific AI governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the causal link between humanlike AI design and its effects on engagement and trust, and to address the gap in global diversity of AI users.

Method: Two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system.

Result: Humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users, but do not universally increase engagement and trust. The effects are moderated by culture.

Conclusion: We encourage moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.

Abstract: Over a billion users across the globe interact with AI systems engineered with increasing sophistication to mimic human traits. This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.

### [21] [When Reasoning Meets Its Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17901)
*Junyu Zhang,Yifan Sun,Tianang Leng,Jingyan Shen,Liu Ziyin,Paul Pu Liang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper introduces Laws of Reasoning (LoRe) framework for Large Reasoning Models, with compute law (compute scales linearly with question complexity) and accuracy law. They create LoRe-Bench to measure monotonicity and compositionality. Most models lack compositionality; finetuning for compositionality improves reasoning performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show promising performance but often exhibit counterintuitive reasoning behaviors, limiting their reasoning capabilities. A unified theoretical framework is needed to formalize desired reasoning patterns and guide model improvement. The authors aim to establish laws that govern reasoning compute and accuracy, and propose a benchmark to assess compliance, ultimately improving model reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces Laws of Reasoning (LoRe) comprising compute law (linear scaling of reasoning compute with question complexity) and supplementary accuracy law. Since question complexity is hard to quantify, they examine two properties: monotonicity and compositionality. They create LoRe-Bench, a benchmark to systematically measure these properties. They evaluate existing reasoning models and find they lack compositionality. They then develop a finetuning approach to enforce compute-law compositionality.

Result: Evaluation using LoRe-Bench shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. The authors' finetuning approach to enforce compute-law compositionality yields consistent improvement in reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

Conclusion: The authors propose the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe) framework to formalize desired reasoning behaviors in Large Reasoning Models. They establish the compute law (reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity) and the accuracy law. Through the LoRe-Bench benchmark, they find most models show reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. They develop a finetuning approach to enforce compute-law compositionality, which leads to improved reasoning performance across benchmarks and reveals synergistic effects. Thus, aligning models with LoRe laws enhances reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the superior performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their reasoning behaviors are often counterintuitive, leading to suboptimal reasoning capabilities. To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

*Kwangjun Ahn,Noah Amsel,John Langford*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Dion2, a simpler method than previous approaches to reduce Muon optimizer's computational cost by selectively sampling rows/columns for orthonormalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer has strong performance but suffers from super-linear orthonormalization cost that scales poorly. Previous attempts to reduce matrix size were complex.

Method: Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those, making the update sparse.

Result: Reduces both computation and communication costs, improving Muon's scalability.

Conclusion: Dion2 provides a simpler and effective approach to enhance Muon optimizer efficiency compared to prior methods.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer enjoys strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding. However, the super-linear cost of its orthonormalization step introduces increasing overhead with scale. To alleviate this cost, several works have attempted to reduce the size of the matrix entering the orthonormalization step. We introduce Dion2, a much simpler method for shrinking the matrix involved in Muon's computation compared to prior approaches. At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those. This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon.

TL;DR: Low-cost dual-mode neuro-muscular control system using EEG (blink detection) and EMG (threshold-based) for intuitive prosthetic arm control, built with affordable components for underserved populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of intuitive control systems in affordable upper-limb prostheses, which limits functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings.

Method: Integration of EEG and EMG signals: EEG signals from NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 with blink detection using a lightweight classification model; EMG signals from MyoWare 2.0 sensor with threshold-based detection for elbow control. System uses ESP32 microcontrollers for processing and actuation.

Result: A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars) with EEG-controlled finger servos and EMG-controlled elbow servos. The system enables real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.

Abstract: Affordable upper-limb prostheses often lack intuitive control systems, limiting functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings. This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical and empirical comparison of quantum-inspired ML paradigms, analyzing their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE variants.

Method: Experimental analysis comparing PGM and KPGM classifiers against classical random forest baseline using QSMOTE variants for synthetic oversampling.

Result: Both PGM and KPGM outperform classical random forest, with PGM achieving highest accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234) using stereo encoding and n_copies=2.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired classifiers provide tangible performance gains and complementary strengths - PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements while KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies.

Abstract: Quantum-inspired machine learning (QiML) leverages mathematical frameworks from quantum theory to enhance classical algorithms, with particular emphasis on inner product structures in high-dimensional feature spaces. Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies. Our results advance the understanding of kernel-based and measurement-based QiML methods, offering practical guidance on their applicability under varying data characteristics and computational constraints.

*Seong Ho Pahng,Guoye Guan,Benjamin Fefferman,Sahand Hormoz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffeoMorph is a differentiable framework for learning morphogenesis protocols using SE(3)-equivariant GNNs and a novel 3D Zernike-based shape-matching loss, enabling agents to self-organize into complex 3D shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address how distributed control in biological systems leads to precise global patterns, with applications in developmental biology, distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. The goal is to develop a learning framework for morphogenesis protocols that can guide agents to form target 3D shapes.

Method: The method introduces DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network for agent updates, trained with a novel shape-matching loss based on 3D Zernike polynomials that is invariant to agent ordering, count, and rigid-body transformations. It includes an alignment step for full SO(3) invariance, formulated as a bilevel optimization problem with implicit differentiation through the alignment step.

Result: The results show systematic benchmarking highlighting the advantages of the shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics. The framework is demonstrated to successfully form a range of shapes, from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies, using only minimal spatial cues.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DiffeoMorph is an effective framework for learning distributed morphogenesis protocols, capable of guiding agents to form complex 3D shapes using only minimal spatial cues, with the proposed shape-matching loss offering significant advantages over traditional distance metrics.

Abstract: Biological systems can form complex three-dimensional structures through the collective behavior of identical agents -- cells that follow the same internal rules and communicate without central control. How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.

### [26] [Compression is Routing: Reconstruction Error as an Intrinsic Signal for Modular Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16963)
*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes 'Compression is Routing' - using transformer autoencoder's reconstruction error as domain fingerprint for interpretable, scalable expert routing without explicit gating networks, achieving 64x sequence compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three major challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs): context length limitations, high inference costs, and catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. Current Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have limitations with complex routing mechanisms that lack interpretability.

Method: The authors trained an 87M-parameter Transformer Autoencoder to compress 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors (64x compression). They experimentally validated the compressor's domain discriminative capability by measuring reconstruction accuracy across in-domain, semi-out-of-distribution, and fully out-of-distribution data.

Result: The compressor achieved 99.47% reconstruction accuracy on in-domain (code) validation, 47.76% on semi-OOD (Wiki text), and 0.57% on fully OOD (random sequences), demonstrating extreme domain discriminative capability. This establishes reconstruction error as an Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint for routing.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed compression-based routing approach offers a novel and scalable architecture for modular neural networks, addressing key LLM limitations while providing new perspectives on VRAM compression and interpretable expert scheduling.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) face three major challenges: context length limitations, high inference costs, and catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures mitigate some of these conflicts, their routing mechanisms typically rely on explicitly trained auxiliary classifiers. This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.
  Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \textbf{99.47\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \textbf{47.76\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \textbf{0.57\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).
  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks.

TL;DR: XGBoost framework using METAR data for aviation weather nowcasting outperforms traditional TAF forecasts with better detection rates and explainability


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current operational approaches for low-visibility and precipitation nowcasting rely on computationally intensive methods with conservative biases and limited resolution

Method: Lightweight gradient boosting (XGBoost) trained on surface observation data (METAR) with physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles, evaluated across 11 international airports

Result: Model achieved 2.5-4.0 times improvement in recall at 3-hour horizons while reducing false alarms compared to operational TAF forecasts

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures local physical processes automatically and provides actionable explainability through SHAP analysis for operational situational awareness

Abstract: Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of GRPO to multi-turn tasks with long-horizon reasoning shows limitations, prompting investigation into more stable advantage estimation strategies.

Method: The authors first explore PPO as a more robust alternative to GRPO, then introduce turn-PPO which operates on a turn-level MDP formulation instead of token-level MDP.

Result: Experimental results on WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.

Conclusion: Turn-PPO provides a more effective approach for multi-turn reinforcement learning tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning compared to existing methods like GRPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has re-emerged as a natural approach for training interactive LLM agents in real-world environments. However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.

*Chang-Hwan Lee,Chanseung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GB-DQN is a novel deep reinforcement learning method that uses gradient boosting to create an adaptive ensemble of Q-networks, enabling better handling of non-stationary environments by incrementally learning residuals after environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep RL methods struggle in non-stationary environments where changes in dynamics or rewards cause catastrophic forgetting and invalidate learned value functions.

Method: Instead of retraining a single Q-network, GB-DQN builds an additive ensemble where each new learner is trained to approximate the Bellman residual of the current ensemble after environmental drift occurs.

Result: Experiments across various control tasks with controlled dynamics changes show GB-DQN achieves faster recovery, improved stability, and greater robustness compared to DQN and other non-stationary baselines.

Conclusion: GB-DQN effectively addresses model drift in non-stationary environments through incremental residual learning, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the optimal value function after environmental changes.

Abstract: Non-stationary environments pose a fundamental challenge for deep reinforcement learning, as changes in dynamics or rewards invalidate learned value functions and cause catastrophic forgetting. We propose \emph{Gradient-Boosted Deep Q-Networks (GB-DQN)}, an adaptive ensemble method that addresses model drift through incremental residual learning. Instead of retraining a single Q-network, GB-DQN constructs an additive ensemble in which each new learner is trained to approximate the Bellman residual of the current ensemble after drift. We provide theoretical results showing that each boosting step reduces the empirical Bellman residual and that the ensemble converges to the post-drift optimal value function under standard assumptions. Experiments across a diverse set of control tasks with controlled dynamics changes demonstrate faster recovery, improved stability, and greater robustness compared to DQN and common non-stationary baselines.

*Haoye Lu,Yaoliang Yu,Darren Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distribution restoration from corrupted samples using entropic optimal transport and EM-like algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully observed samples are expensive, while partial noisy observations are easier to collect.

Method: One-sided entropic optimal transport framed as an EM-like algorithm; SFBD-OMNI framework extends SFBD to handle arbitrary corruption models.

Result: Test criterion for recoverability; method works with few clean samples; outperforms benchmarks in diverse settings.

Conclusion: SFBD-OMNI effectively generalizes distribution restoration beyond Gaussian corruption, showing strong performance.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTDR is a lightweight retrieval method that dynamically adapts to task context to improve function calling success rates by 23-104% over static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing on-device agents often have static retrieval that fails to capture multi-step dependencies and evolving task context, leading to irrelevant tools and degraded performance.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), modeling tool dependencies from demonstrations and conditioning retrieval on initial query and execution context, with integration strategies into prompts.

Result: Benchmarked across datasets and LLMs, DTDR shows improvements in retrieval precision, task accuracy, and efficiency, with function calling success rates increasing by 23-104%.

Conclusion: Dynamic retrieval significantly outperforms static methods, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of function calling agents by adapting to context in real-time.

Abstract: Function calling agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) select external tools to automate complex tasks. On-device agents typically use a retrieval module to select relevant tools, improving performance and reducing context length. However, existing retrieval methods rely on static and limited inputs, failing to capture multi-step tool dependencies and evolving task context. This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold. We benchmark DTDR against state-of-the-art retrieval methods across multiple datasets and LLM backbones, evaluating retrieval precision, downstream task accuracy, and computational efficiency. Additionally, we explore strategies to integrate retrieved tools into prompts. Our results show that dynamic tool retrieval improves function calling success rates between $23\%$ and $104\%$ compared to state-of-the-art static retrievers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Establishes equivalence between k-NN classifier consistency, Lebesgue-Besicovitch differentiation property, and Nagata dimension for metric spaces, proving final implication (1)→(3) and correcting previous work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complete the proof of equivalence between three important mathematical conditions for complete separable metric spaces, which had one implication missing from previous literature.

Method: Mathematical proof establishing the implication that universal consistency of k-nearest neighbor classifier implies sigma-finite dimensionality in Nagata sense.

Result: Successfully proved the implication (1)→(3), completing the equivalence chain: (1)⇔(2)⇔(3). Also corrected an incorrect claim from previous work.

Conclusion: The three conditions are equivalent for complete separable metric spaces, providing a comprehensive characterization linking classification theory, measure differentiation, and geometric dimension theory.

Abstract: We prove the last remaining implication allowing to claim the equivalence of the following conditions for a complete separable metric space $X$:
  (1) The $k$-nearest neighbour classifier is (weakly) universally consistent in $X$, (2) The strong Lebesgue--Besicovitch differentiation property holds in $X$ for every locally finite Borel measure, (3) $X$ is sigma-finite dimensional in the sense of Nagata.
  The equivalence (2)$\iff$(3) was announced by Preiss (1983), while a detailed proof of the implication (3)$\Rightarrow$(2) has appeared in Assouad and Quentin de Gromard (2006). The implication (2)$\Rightarrow$(1) was established by Cérou and Guyader (2006). We prove the implication (1)$\Rightarrow$(3). The result was conjectured in the first article in the series (Collins, Kumari, Pestov 2020), and here we also correct a wrong claim made in the second article (Kumari and Pestov 2024).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of a Bandwidth-Efficient Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts paper


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts models face memory and bandwidth constraints; existing quantization methods degrade accuracy

Method: Router-guided precision restoration using precomputed low-rank compensators with Top-n expert selection

Result: Superior bandwidth-accuracy trade-off and improved throughput

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses bandwidth limitations while maintaining accuracy in MoE systems

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale capacity via sparse activation but stress memory and bandwidth. Offloading alleviates GPU memory by fetching experts on demand, yet token-level routing causes irregular transfers that make inference I/O-bound. Static uniform quantization reduces traffic but degrades accuracy under aggressive compression by ignoring expert heterogeneity. We present Bandwidth-Efficient Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts via Low-Rank Compensation, which performs router-guided precision restoration using precomputed low-rank compensators. At inference time, our method transfers compact low-rank factors with Top-n (n<k) experts per token and applies compensation to them, keeping others low-bit. Integrated with offloading on GPU and GPU-NDP systems, our method delivers a superior bandwidth-accuracy trade-off and improved throughput.

*Saraswathy Amjith,Mihika Dusad,Neha Muramalla,Shweta Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training models on intentionally flawed reasoning traces improves their ability to detect and recover from errors without harming standard problem-solving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought prompting is vulnerable to early errors propagating to final answers, creating a need for models that can identify and correct mistakes.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen3-4B using GRPO with binary reward on MATH-lighteval problems, using CoT prefixes containing controlled errors (calculation or reasoning errors).

Result: Mixed-CoT-RL matched standard RL on clean problems (41% accuracy) but outperformed it on flawed-reasoning problems (24% vs 19%). Reasoning error training provided greater robustness than calculation errors alone.

Conclusion: Exposure to flawed reasoning during training enhances error-recovery capability without accuracy loss, offering a pathway to more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become central to mathematical reasoning in large language models, yet models remain brittle to early errors: a single arithmetic slip or unjustified inference typically propagates uncorrected to an incorrect final answer. We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

*Lorenzo Loconte,Adrián Javaloy,Antonio Vergari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces parameterizations for squared circuits to enable efficient marginalization without loss of expressiveness, using ideas from canonical forms of tensor networks and determinism in circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Squared tensor networks and squared circuits are expressive distribution estimators but suffer from computational overhead in marginalization due to the squaring operation, limiting their applicability in machine learning.

Method: The authors propose parameterizing squared circuits via unitary matrices and leveraging orthogonality from canonical forms and determinism in circuits to simplify marginalization, even for factorizations not directly mapping to tensor networks.

Result: The parameterizations allow efficient marginalization in squared circuits for various factorizations, eliminating computational barriers without compromising expressiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed conditions in squared circuits enable more efficient learning in distribution estimation tasks, demonstrating practical applicability without expressiveness loss.

Abstract: Squared tensor networks (TNs) and their extension as computational graphs--squared circuits--have been used as expressive distribution estimators, yet supporting closed-form marginalization. However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical planning approach combining reinforcement learning and MPC that improves robustness and performance across domains like race driving and Lunar Lander.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing planning methods struggle with complex hierarchical problems; this work aims to create a more robust and adaptable planning framework.

Method: Tightly couples RL and MPC planning: uses RL actions to guide MPPI sampling and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples for value estimation, focusing exploration where uncertainty is high.

Result: Achieves up to 72% higher success rates and 2.1x faster convergence than baseline methods, with better data efficiency across tested domains.

Conclusion: The fused RL-MPC approach enables robust handling of complex planning problems with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for solving planning problems with a hierarchical structure, fusing reinforcement learning and MPC planning. Our formulation tightly and elegantly couples the two planning paradigms. It leverages reinforcement learning actions to inform the MPPI sampler, and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to inform the value estimation. The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature of deep neural networks limits trust and adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Method: Model-agnostic framework that modifies input samples to identify influential temporal features and assess impact on predictions.

Result: UniCoMTE produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations, outperforming LIME and SHAP in comprehensibility and generalizability.

Conclusion: By linking predictions to signal patterns, UniCoMTE advances interpretability for real-world time series applications.

Abstract: Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have demonstrated strong performance in classifying complex time series data. However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications.

Conclusion: The application of differentiable physical simulators, specifically the proposed GFPI method, is feasible and effective for fault diagnosis in PV systems, offering improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate fault diagnosis and quantification are essential for the reliable operation and intelligent maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. However, existing fault quantification methods often suffer from limited efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fault quantification approach for PV strings based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM). The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis.

Motivation: Need to overcome redundant model loads and fragmented execution in video-language pipelines on mobile devices

Method: Decomposes billion-parameter model into reusable modules (visual encoder, language decoder) and reuses them across subtasks

Result: 27-33% faster execution on smartphones with minimal performance impact

Conclusion: Atom enables practical, scalable video-language understanding on edge devices

Abstract: Recent advances in video-language models have enabled powerful applications like video retrieval, captioning, and assembly. However, executing such multi-stage pipelines efficiently on mobile devices remains challenging due to redundant model loads and fragmented execution. We introduce Atom, an on-device system that restructures video-language pipelines for fast and efficient execution. Atom decomposes a billion-parameter model into reusable modules, such as the visual encoder and language decoder, and reuses them across subtasks like captioning, reasoning, and indexing. This reuse-centric design eliminates repeated model loading and enables parallel execution, reducing end-to-end latency without sacrificing performance. On commodity smartphones, Atom achieves 27--33% faster execution compared to non-reuse baselines, with only marginal performance drop ($\leq$ 2.3 Recall@1 in retrieval, $\leq$ 1.5 CIDEr in captioning). These results position Atom as a practical, scalable approach for efficient video-language understanding on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current workflows wastefully discard curvature information after training only to recompute similar information for model merging, losing valuable trajectory data.

Method: Maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training that can be reused for geometry-aware model composition, with memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: Outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, improves multi-task merging over strong baselines, and exhibits rank-invariant convergence with superior hyperparameter robustness.

Conclusion: By treating optimization trajectory as a reusable asset, this approach eliminates redundant computation while enabling more principled model composition with established convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Training large neural networks and merging task-specific models both exploit low-rank structure and require parameter importance estimation, yet these challenges have been pursued in isolation. Current workflows compute curvature information during training, discard it, then recompute similar information for merging -- wasting computation and discarding valuable trajectory data. We introduce a unified framework that maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training, then reuses this information for geometry-aware model composition. The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines. The proposed framework exhibits rank-invariant convergence and superior hyperparameter robustness compared to existing low-rank optimizers. By treating the optimization trajectory as a reusable asset rather than discarding it, our approach eliminates redundant computation while enabling more principled model composition.

TL;DR: CLIP-based medical imaging models struggle with negation. This study fine-tunes a model to improve negation handling in chest X-ray retrieval, observing trade-offs and analyzing internal model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models like CLIP are useful in medical imaging for tasks like retrieval, report generation, and classification due to their ability to align images and text without extensive labeled data. However, CLIP-based models often underperform when interpreting negated phrases, which is problematic in medical diagnosis. This study aims to understand and improve the model's handling of negation in clinical contexts.

Method: The research evaluates the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on chest X-ray image retrieval using prompts with and without negation. It fine-tunes the base model using methods from previous work to improve retrieval accuracy. The internal model behavior is analyzed through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to understand changes in text encoders' representations of negated clinical language.

Result: The fine-tuned model shows improvement in handling negation but with a slight decrease in accuracy for positive prompt evaluation. Internal behavior analysis reveals how each fine-tuning approach reshapes the text encoder's representation of negated clinical language.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that fine-tuning CLIP-based models can improve their handling of negated phrases in medical imaging retrieval, though with a trade-off in positive prompt accuracy. The analysis of internal model behavior (token attribution, t-SNE, attention-head ablation) provides insights into how fine-tuning affects text encoders. This work contributes to understanding CLIP's internal mechanisms and enhancing its reliability for medical AI applications.

Abstract: Large vision-language models like CLIP are increasingly used in medical imaging tasks due to their ability to align images and text without the need for extensive labeled data. This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.

*Aaron Defazio,Konstantin Mishchenko,Parameswaran Raman,Hao-Jun Michael Shi,Lin Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA) extends Nesterov's method to overcome limitations of recent averaging optimizers like Schedule-Free and single-worker DiLoCo by decoupling interpolation constants, enabling smooth per-step averaging with better performance, simpler tuning, and reduced memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent averaging optimizers like Schedule-Free and single-worker DiLoCo improve AdamW but have limitations: Schedule-Free uses uniform averaging while DiLoCo has a complex two-loop structure with high memory and hyperparameter overhead.

Method: GPA decouples the interpolation constant in Nesterov's primal averaging formulation, allowing smooth averaging at every step instead of periodic aggregation, generalizing single-worker DiLoCo without its two-loop complexity.

Result: Empirical results show GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo, with speedups of 24.22% on Llama-160M, 12% on small batch ImageNet ViT, and 27% on large batch setups to reach AdamW's validation performance, while reducing memory to one buffer.

Conclusion: GPA provides a superior averaging strategy that simplifies optimization, reduces resource requirements, and maintains or improves convergence guarantees for base optimizers with O(√T) regret bounds.

Abstract: We propose Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA), an extension of Nesterov's method in its primal averaging formulation that addresses key limitations of recent averaging-based optimizers such as single-worker DiLoCo and Schedule-Free (SF) in the non-distributed setting. These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.

Stability is defined through a generalized Gale-Shapley multi-to-one matching, a well-established solution concept in wireless resource allocation. We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination. SMILE enables cells to distributedly balance exploration of unknown channels with exploitation of learned information. We prove that SMILE converges to the optimal stable allocation and achieves logarithmic regret relative to a genie with full knowledge of expected utilities. Simulations validate the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate SMILE's robustness, scalability, and efficiency across diverse spectrum-sharing scenarios.

*Shao-Ting Chiu,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BumpNet is a sparse neural network framework using trainable sigmoid-based basis functions for PDE solutions and operator learning, with three specialized variants showing strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radial-basis function networks have limitations for modern PDE learning; BumpNet aims to enable efficient use of modern training techniques through sigmoid-based basis functions.

Method: Constructs meshless basis functions from ordinary sigmoid activations; parameters (shape, location, amplitude) are fully trainable; achieves adaptivity via dynamic pruning; integrates with PINNs, EDNNs, and DeepONets.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and accuracy of BumpNet variants (Bump-PINNs, Bump-EDNN, Bump-DeepONet) for various PDE tasks.

Conclusion: BumpNet provides a flexible, high-performance framework for PDE numerical solutions and operator learning, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce BumpNet, a sparse neural network framework for PDE numerical solution and operator learning. BumpNet is based on meshless basis function expansion, in a similar fashion to radial-basis function (RBF) networks. Unlike RBF networks, the basis functions in BumpNet are constructed from ordinary sigmoid activation functions. This enables the efficient use of modern training techniques optimized for such networks. All parameters of the basis functions, including shape, location, and amplitude, are fully trainable. Model parsimony and h-adaptivity are effectively achieved through dynamically pruning basis functions during training. BumpNet is a general framework that can be combined with existing neural architectures for learning PDE solutions: here, we propose Bump-PINNs (BumpNet with physics-informed neural networks) for solving general PDEs; Bump-EDNN (BumpNet with evolutionary deep neural networks) to solve time-evolution PDEs; and Bump-DeepONet (BumpNet with deep operator networks) for PDE operator learning. Bump-PINNs are trained using the same collocation-based approach used by PINNs, Bump-EDNN uses a BumpNet only in the spatial domain and uses EDNNs to advance the solution in time, while Bump-DeepONets employ a BumpNet regression network as the trunk network of a DeepONet. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed architecture.

*Jiwoo Song,Daning Huang,John Harlim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel kernel ridge regression method that uses diffusion maps to adapt to the intrinsic geometry of dynamical systems achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many complex nonlinear dynamical systems are difficult to predict accurately over long time horizons, and existing data-driven models often fail when geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented.

Method: Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) combines kernel ridge regression with a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, which implicitly adapts to the system's intrinsic geometry without explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling.

Result: DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods (random feature models, neural networks, and operator-learning methods) across a broad range of systems including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, in both accuracy and data efficiency.

Conclusion: Long-term predictive skill depends critically on respecting geometric constraints through dynamically consistent model selection, and DM-KRR provides a promising path for reliable, efficient learning of complex dynamical systems through its simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to predict accurately over long time horizons. Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.

*Yongqi Li,Hao Lang,Fei Huang,Tieyun Qian,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces R-EMID, an information-theoretic metric to measure role-playing model (RPM) generalization degradation under distribution shifts, and proposes a co-evolving RL framework to improve RPM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Role-playing models underperform in real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (user, character, dialogue composition), but existing methods lack fine-grained diagnosis and formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization.

Method: Developed R-EMID metric to interpretably measure RPM performance degradation, derived an upper bound for worst-case generalization prediction, and proposed co-evolving reinforcement learning to model connections among user, character, and dialogue context.

Result: Evaluation showed user shift poses the highest risk to RPM generalization, and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM performance.

Conclusion: R-EMID provides an interpretable framework for diagnosing RPM generalization issues, with theoretical insights and practical reinforcement learning solutions to mitigate distribution shift effects.

Abstract: Role-playing models (RPMs) are widely used in real-world applications but underperform when deployed in the wild. This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of EV charging demand forecasting across time horizons and spatial scales using multiple models and real-world datasets


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As electric vehicles adoption grows, concerns about their impact on grid management have increased, making EV charging demand prediction an important problem. However, few studies systematically compare forecasting methods across different time horizons and spatial scales in diverse urban settings.

Method: The authors compare five time series forecasting models (statistical, machine learning, deep learning) across three temporal horizons (minutes, hours, days) and multiple spatial aggregation levels (individual stations, regional, city-level) using four public real-world datasets.

Result: The paper presents evaluation results of five forecasting models across multiple temporal and spatial dimensions using four real-world datasets. While specific performance metrics aren't detailed in the abstract, the comprehensive analysis provides insights into model effectiveness for different forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive benchmarking of EV charging demand forecasting methods, offering practical insights for model selection based on time horizon and spatial scale. It represents the first systematic evaluation across such a wide range of temporal and spatial dimensions using multiple real-world datasets.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of electric vehicles as a means of addressing climate change, concerns have emerged regarding their impact on electric grid management. As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate EV charging demand forecasting across such a wide range of temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels using multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: M2RU provides a scalable and energy-efficient solution for real-time adaptation in edge temporal intelligence, with up to 12.2 years of operational lifetime.

Abstract: Continual learning on edge platforms remains challenging because recurrent networks depend on energy-intensive training procedures and frequent data movement that are impractical for embedded deployments. This work introduces M2RU, a mixed-signal architecture that implements the minion recurrent unit for efficient temporal processing with on-chip continual learning. The architecture integrates weighted-bit streaming, which enables multi-bit digital inputs to be processed in crossbars without high-resolution conversion, and an experience replay mechanism that stabilizes learning under domain shifts. M2RU achieves 15 GOPS at 48.62 mW, corresponding to 312 GOPS per watt, and maintains accuracy within 5 percent of software baselines on sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Compared with a CMOS digital design, the accelerator provides 29X improvement in energy efficiency. Device-aware analysis shows an expected operational lifetime of 12.2 years under continual learning workloads. These results establish M2RU as a scalable and energy-efficient platform for real-time adaptation in edge-level temporal intelligence.

### [50] [SHARP-QoS: Sparsely-gated Hierarchical Adaptive Routing for joint Prediction of QoS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17262)
*Suraj Kumar,Arvind Kumar,Soumi Chattopadhyay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHARP-QoS proposes a unified joint QoS prediction model using hyperbolic convolution, adaptive feature-sharing, and EMA-based loss balancing to overcome sparse/noisy QoS data and negative transfer issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world QoS data are sparse, noisy, and hierarchical with dependencies, making accurate prediction hard. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple models that increase cost and reduce generalization. Joint prediction models suffer from negative transfer due to inconsistent QoS parameter ranges and inadequate representation.

Method: 1. Dual hyperbolic convolution in Poincaré ball to extract hierarchical QoS and contextual features. 2. Adaptive feature-sharing with gated fusion for dynamic selection between structural/shared representations. 3. EMA-based loss balancing for stable joint optimization.

Result: Outperforms single- and multi-task baselines on three datasets with 2/3/4 QoS parameters. Effectively addresses sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start problems with moderate computational overhead.

Conclusion: SHARP-QoS provides reliable joint QoS prediction by integrating hierarchical feature extraction, adaptive sharing, and balanced optimization, demonstrating strong practical capability.

Abstract: Dependable service-oriented computing relies on multiple Quality of Service (QoS) parameters that are essential to assess service optimality. However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincaré ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines. Extensive study shows that our model effectively addresses major challenges, including sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start, while maintaining moderate computational overhead, underscoring its capability for reliable joint QoS prediction.

*Michael Merry,Pat Riddle,Jim Warren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a criterion for inherent explainability using graph theory, provides annotations for local explanations, and demonstrates with PREDICT model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of consistent definition or test for inherent explainability in XAI; current approaches rely on metrics or intuition.

Method: Uses graph theory to decompose models for structure-local explanations and recompose into global explanations with verifiable hypothesis-evidence annotations.

Result: Criterion matches intuitions on inherent explainability, differentiates explainable vs explained models, and provides full explanation of PREDICT model.

Conclusion: Provides formal structure for explainability work and offers regulators a flexible, rigorous test for compliance frameworks.

Abstract: Inherent explainability is the gold standard in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - "we know it when we see it". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks.

*Zhenyu Tao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GBSM, a generalized bisimulation metric for comparing state similarities across different MDPs, with proven mathematical properties and improved theoretical bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While bisimulation metrics work well within single MDPs, existing extensions to multiple MDPs lack established mathematical foundations, limiting theoretical analysis.

Method: The authors formally define GBSM with rigorous proofs of three fundamental metric properties: symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and distance bounds on identical spaces.

Result: GBSM enables tighter theoretical bounds for policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, with closed-form sample complexity improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: GBSM provides a mathematically sound framework for multi-MDP analysis, validated by numerical experiments showing its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for analyzing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to state similarity between multiple MDPs remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive pruning algorithm for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks to reduce communication overhead in edge deployment for smart mobility, while maintaining accuracy via novel SEPA metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying ST-GNNs at the edge across cloudlets creates substantial communication overhead due to overlapping node feature transmissions, necessitating efficient filtering.

Method: Propose adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbor features based on recent model performance; introduce SEPA metric for event responsiveness; evaluate in online semi-decentralized settings with FL and Gossip Learning on traffic datasets.

Result: Our approach maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost; SEPA metric exposes true spatial connectivity benefits in dynamic traffic prediction.

Conclusion: Communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events, demonstrating practical efficiency for edge deployment in smart mobility systems.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) are well-suited for processing high-frequency data streams from geographically distributed sensors in smart mobility systems. However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning model for analyzing long-term electricity markets and decarbonization pathways


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for advanced tools to support policymakers in designing and evaluating long-term electricity markets for decarbonization

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning using independent proximal policy optimization, tested on Italian electricity system with varying competition levels and market designs

Result: Framework successfully captures key features of decarbonizing energy systems and highlights critical role of market design in avoiding price volatility

Conclusion: The proposed model enables assessment of long-term electricity markets where multiple policies and mechanisms interact, with participants adapting to decarbonization pathways

Abstract: Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.

*Farinaz Mostajeran,Aruzhan Tleubek,Salah A Faroughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MINPO is a neural framework that learns nonlocal operators from integro-differential equations, using KANs or MLPs to efficiently model spatiotemporal dependencies without repeated convolution evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical methods for integro-differential equations (IDEs) are computationally expensive due to repeated convolution integrals, and existing neural solvers lack generalization across diverse nonlocal structures.

Method: MINPO uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or MLPs as encoders to learn the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, with a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss to enforce coherence between operator and solution.

Result: MINPO shows high accuracy and robustness in handling various kernel types, dimensionalities, and computational demands, outperforming classical techniques and neural-based strategies like A-PINN, fPINN, A-PIKAN, and fPIKAN.

Conclusion: MINPO generalizes beyond problem-specific approaches, providing a unified framework for systems with nonlocal operators, making it efficient and scalable for diverse IDE applications.

Abstract: Many physical systems exhibit nonlocal spatiotemporal behaviors described by integro-differential equations (IDEs). Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators.

*Yen-Chieh Huang,Rui Fang,Ming-Syan Chen,Pi-Cheng Hsiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WG-KV introduces a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before writing to the KV cache, reducing memory usage and speeding up inference for long-context LLMs with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of long-context LLM inference, which is hindered by quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth, by focusing on selective writing to persistent memory rather than post-hoc selection or eviction.

Method: The method involves learning to predict token utility before it enters the cache, thus filtering low-utility states early. This is instantiated through Write-Gated KV, which maintains a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache.

Result: The results show a 46-57% reduction in memory usage, 3.03-3.45x prefill speedup, and 1.89-2.56x decode speedup on Llama models with negligible accuracy loss. The method is compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that learning what tokens to write to the KV cache is a principled and practical approach for efficient long-context inference, as demonstrated by significant speedups and memory reductions with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical assessments for Alzheimer's disease are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets, creating a fundamental challenge for machine learning approaches.

Method: The framework integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory (using Wasserstein distances) to leverage manifold structure in neuroimaging data and propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations.

Result: Evaluated on nearly 5,000 subjects, MATCH-AD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects, substantially outperforming all baseline methods with kappa indicating almost perfect agreement.

Conclusion: Principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of partially annotated neuroimaging data, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining clinical-level accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis face a fundamental challenges. Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability. These results demonstrate that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of the vast repositories of partially annotated neuroimaging data accumulating worldwide, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy suitable for clinical deployment.

Motivation: To develop a parameter-efficient and fast model for long-term multivariate time series forecasting, enhancing spatial corrections over linear baselines while being more compact and interpretable than transformer-based methods.

Method: Integrates decomposition-based temporal modeling (trend-seasonal) with a spatial module using low-rank Top-K adjacency learning for sparse graph structure and conservative horizon-wise gating for message passing.

Abstract: We propose Lite-STGNN, a lightweight spatial-temporal graph neural network for long-term multivariate forecasting that integrates decomposition-based temporal modeling with learnable sparse graph structure. The temporal module applies trend-seasonal decomposition, while the spatial module performs message passing with low-rank Top-$K$ adjacency learning and conservative horizon-wise gating, enabling spatial corrections that enhance a strong linear baseline. Lite-STGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmark datasets for horizons up to 720 steps, while being parameter-efficient and substantially faster to train than transformer-based methods. Ablation studies show that the spatial module yields 4.6% improvement over the temporal baseline, Top-$K$ enhances locality by 3.3%, and learned adjacency matrices reveal domain-specific interaction dynamics. Lite-STGNN thus offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting.

*Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeBench-Seq is a reproducible CPU-only protein hazard screening benchmark using homology control, calibrated classifiers, and public data to address biosecurity risks from foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for protein design pose biosecurity risks, and the community lacks a simple, reproducible baseline for sequence-level hazard screening that runs on commodity CPUs and is explicitly evaluated under homology control.

Method: Built SafeBench-Seq using public data from SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benign sequences. Used interpretable features (physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition), homology clustering at ≤40% identity with cluster-level holdouts, and calibrated classifiers with multiple evaluation metrics.

Result: Random splits significantly overestimate robustness compared to homology-clustered evaluation. Calibrated linear models show good calibration, while tree ensembles have slightly higher Brier/ECE scores. The benchmark successfully enables rigorous evaluation without distributing hazardous sequences.

Conclusion: SafeBench-Seq provides a reproducible CPU-only baseline for protein hazard screening under homology control, mitigating shortcut learning risks and enabling rigorous evaluation without distributing hazardous sequences.

Abstract: Foundation models for protein design raise concrete biosecurity risks, yet the community lacks a simple, reproducible baseline for sequence-level hazard screening that is explicitly evaluated under homology control and runs on commodity CPUs. We introduce SafeBench-Seq, a metadata-only, reproducible benchmark and baseline classifier built entirely from public data (SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benigns) and interpretable features (global physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition). To approximate "never-before-seen" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE. SafeBench-Seq is CPU-only, reproducible, and releases metadata only (accessions, cluster IDs, split labels), enabling rigorous evaluation without distributing hazardous sequences.

*Yikang Yue,Yishu Yin,Xuehai Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreedySnake is an SSD-offloaded training system using vertical scheduling that achieves 1.96-2.53x higher throughput than ZeRO-Infinity for large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSD-offloaded training needs cost-effective solutions; existing horizontal scheduling systems have limitations with smaller batch sizes.

Method: Uses vertical scheduling (processing all microbatches per layer first), gradient accumulation, and overlaps optimization with next iteration's forward pass.

Result: Achieves 1.96x (1 GPU) and 1.93x (4 GPUs) throughput improvement for GPT-65B, and 2.53x (1 GPU) for GPT-175B compared to ZeRO-Infinity.

Conclusion: GreedySnake significantly improves training throughput for large LLMs, making SSD-offloaded training more practical and cost-effective.

Abstract: SSD-offloaded training offers a practical and promising approach to making LLM training cost-effective. Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

### [61] [Task Schema and Binding: A Double Dissociation Study of In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17325)
*Chaeha Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICL decomposes into separable Task Schema and Binding mechanisms validated across architectures, with schema reliance inversely correlated with prior knowledge, enabling improved prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the ICL puzzle by providing causal validation of separable mechanisms rather than treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism, contrasting with prior views that were retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian.

Method: Activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters) with double dissociation analysis and correlation studies.

Result: 1. Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching proving separable mechanisms. 2. Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596). 3. Mechanism operates across all tested architectures including Mamba. 4. Prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) not direct output competition (0%).

Conclusion: Causal mechanistic validation establishes that in-context learning decomposes into two neurally separable mechanisms - Task Schema and Binding - that operate across Transformer and non-Transformer architectures, with practical implications for prompt engineering and system reliability.

Abstract: We provide causal mechanistic validation that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema (abstract task type recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations). Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:
  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms
  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)
  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba
  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.

### [62] [More Consistent Accuracy PINN via Alternating Easy-Hard Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17607)
*Zhaoqian Gao,Min Yanga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid training strategy combining hard and easy prioritization for PINNs achieves high accuracy and robustness across diverse PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training strategies for PINNs show trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types.

Method: Alternating training algorithm that combines hard and easy prioritization.

Result: Achieves relative L2 errors of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baselines with better reliability.

Conclusion: Provides insights for designing hybrid training strategies to enhance PINN performance and robustness.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a prominent paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their training strategies remain underexplored. While hard prioritization methods inspired by finite element methods are widely adopted, recent research suggests that easy prioritization can also be effective. Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE. This work provides new insights into designing hybrid training strategies to enhance the performance and robustness of PINNs.

### [63] [SCOPE: Sequential Causal Optimization of Process Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17629)
*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOPE is a Prescriptive Process Monitoring approach that uses backward induction and causal learning to recommend aligned sequential interventions to optimize KPIs, outperforming existing methods on sequential PresPM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PresPM methods often treat interventions independently or rely on approximations for reinforcement learning, failing to effectively handle sequences of interventions that interact over time in realistic business processes.

Method: SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate intervention effects by propagating impact from final to first decision points, using causal learners to directly utilize observational data without process approximation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in KPI optimization, with a reusable benchmark dataset provided.

Conclusion: SCOPE addresses the gap in sequential intervention alignment in PresPM by offering a method that avoids simulation dependencies and directly leverages observational data, establishing a foundation for future research in sequential PresPM.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) recommends interventions during business processes to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs). In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM.

*Yidong Chai,Yi Liu,Mohammadreza Ebrahimi,Weifeng Li,Balaji Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ARHOCD framework for adversarially robust harmful content detection using LLM-based sample generation, ensemble methods, dynamic weighting, and iterative adversarial training to improve generalizability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms face harmful content like hate speech, misinformation, and extremist rhetoric. ML models for detection are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Need to enhance adversarial robustness with detectors that can defend against diverse attacks while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Developed a sequential approach: (1) LLM-SGA framework identifies key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and uses them to ensure generalizability; (2) Instantiates ARHOCD detector with three novel components: ensemble of base detectors, dynamic weight assignment using Bayesian inference, and iterative adversarial training strategy.

Result: Empirical evaluation across three datasets (hate speech, rumor, extremist content) shows ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed ARHOCD framework successfully addresses adversarial robustness challenges in harmful content detection, demonstrating strong generalizability and improved accuracy across multiple content types.

Abstract: Social media platforms are plagued by harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, and extremist rhetoric. Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions.

*Mingyu Su,Jian Guan,Yuxian Gu,Minlie Huang,Hongning Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRAPO is a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance, using trust-region SFT and adaptive prefix selection to overcome limitations of the traditional SFT-then-RL pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from inconsistency where SFT's rigid imitation suppresses exploration and causes forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvement in complex reasoning.

Method: TRAPO interleaves SFT and RL by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on model's own completions. It uses Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT) for stable updates and adaptive prefix selection to allocate expert guidance based on utility.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, SFT-then-RL pipelines, and recent state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: TRAPO establishes a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs by unifying external supervision and self-exploration through adaptive interleaving of SFT and RL.

Abstract: Post-training methods, especially Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), play an important role in improving large language models' (LLMs) complex reasoning abilities. However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\textbf{T}rust-\textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs.

### [66] [AdvJudge-Zero: Binary Decision Flips in LLM-as-a-Judge via Adversarial Control Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17375)
*Tung-Ling Li,Yuhao Wu,Hongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems where short control tokens can hack judgments, proposes AdvJudge-Zero to generate such tokens causing false positives in benchmarks, and finds adversarial training mitigates this without harming quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems are crucial for post-training like RLHF/DPO/RLAIF but are susceptible to subtle adversarial strings that flip judgments, posing practical security risks in model refinement processes.

Method: Develops AdvJudge-Zero, a method using next-token distributions and beam search to generate diverse low-perplexity control tokens that perturb hidden states, analyzing their impact on binary judgments across benchmark tasks.

Result: AdvJudge-Zero tokens cause high false positive rates in judge models on math/reasoning tasks, with hidden-state perturbations concentrating in low-rank 'soft modes' anti-aligned to refusal directions, indicating systemic vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Vulnerabilities in judge systems are exploitable via realistic control tokens, but adversarial training on augmented examples can significantly reduce false positives while maintaining evaluation integrity, highlighting needs for robustness measures.

Abstract: Reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems are central to modern post-training pipelines such as RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF, where they provide scalar feedback and binary decisions that guide model selection and RL-based fine-tuning. We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.

TL;DR: YOTO: end-to-end framework for joint gene subset selection and prediction in single-cell transcriptomics using differentiable architecture with multi-task learning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature selection methods are either multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. Need for more integrated approach where prediction directly guides gene selection.

Method: YOTO uses differentiable architecture with sparsity constraint so only selected genes contribute to inference. Implements multi-task learning to share representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform each other without additional training steps.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, demonstrating improved predictive performance while yielding compact, meaningful gene subsets.

Conclusion: Sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact biomarkers, advancing single-cell analysis and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Selecting compact and informative gene subsets from single-cell transcriptomic data is essential for biomarker discovery, improving interpretability, and cost-effective profiling. However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.

### [68] [DeepShare: Sharing ReLU Across Channels and Layers for Efficient Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17398)
*Yonathan Bornfeld,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel activation module using prototype channels to reduce DReLU operations in private inference, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Private Inference (PI) faces computational bottlenecks from ReLU operations, particularly DReLU, which hinders efficiency.

Method: Introduces a method where DReLU is applied only on prototype channels, with replicate channels copying results, reducing non-linear operations.

Result: Drastically cuts DReLU operations in ResNet-type networks, solves an extended XOR problem with minimal non-linearity, and sets new SOTA in classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: The prototype channel approach efficiently reduces computational costs in PI while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Private Inference (PI) uses cryptographic primitives to perform privacy preserving machine learning. In this setting, the owner of the network runs inference on the data of the client without learning anything about the data and without revealing any information about the model. It has been observed that a major computational bottleneck of PI is the calculation of the gate (i.e., ReLU), so a considerable amount of effort have been devoted to reducing the number of ReLUs in a given network.
  We focus on the DReLU, which is the non-linear step function of the ReLU and show that one DReLU can serve many ReLU operations. We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels. We then extend this idea to work across different layers.
  We show that this formulation can drastically reduce the number of DReLU operations in resnet type network. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that this new formulation can solve an extended version of the XOR problem, using just one non-linearity and two neurons, something that traditional formulations and some PI specific methods cannot achieve. We achieve new SOTA results on several classification setups, and achieve SOTA results on image segmentation.

TL;DR: Easy Adaptation (EA) uses Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement large models for task-specific improvements without fine-tuning, reducing resource costs and parameter dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have high resource costs and rely on updating model parameters, which is impractical for closed-source models accessed via APIs; small models can excel on specific tasks with minimal resources.

Method: Propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution of Large Models (LMs) without accessing their parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments show EA matches PEFT performance on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters and requires minimal resources.

Conclusion: EA provides an effective alternative to PEFT by leveraging SSMs to adapt LMs to tasks efficiently and cost-effectively, overcoming key challenges of resource constraints and parameter inaccessibility.

Abstract: While the enormous parameter scale endows Large Models (LMs) with unparalleled performance, it also limits their adaptability across specific tasks. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources.

TL;DR: A statistical toolbox for rigorous subgroup performance analysis in medical imaging, addressing metric selection, uncertainty quantification, multiple comparisons correction, and intersectional subgroup discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for statistically rigorous methods to analyze ML model performance across patient subgroups in medical applications, as current approaches face challenges in valid comparisons and subgroup identification.

Method: Development of a statistical toolbox that handles appropriate performance metrics, uncertainty determination, multiple comparisons correction, and combinatorial subgroup analysis mechanisms.

Result: Toolbox successfully applied in two medical imaging case studies: skin lesion malignancy classification (ISIC2020) and chest X-ray disease classification (MIMIC-CXR), demonstrating practical utility.

Conclusion: The presented toolbox enables rigorous assessment of subgroup performance disparities in medical imaging ML models, providing crucial insights into failure modes while maintaining statistical validity.

Abstract: Analyzing machine learning model performance stratified by patient and recording properties is becoming the accepted norm and often yields crucial insights about important model failure modes. Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The analyses provided by the toolbox are illustrated in two case studies, one in skin lesion malignancy classification on the ISIC2020 dataset and one in chest X-ray-based disease classification on the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

*Herlock Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Score-based diffusion models improved with information geometry using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao frameworks for better sampling of multimodal distributions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical diffusion sampling methods deteriorate exponentially for non-log-concave or multimodal target distributions common in practical generative modeling

Method: Augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms using WFR geometries and implement via weighted stochastic differential equations with Feynman-Kac representation

Result: Formulated reweighting mechanisms with explicit correction terms providing rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics

Conclusion: Establishes geometric and operator-theoretic foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments in diffusion-based sampling

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models currently constitute the state of the art in continuous generative modeling. These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.
  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.

*Shubham Das,Kaushal Singhania,Amit Sadhu,Suprabhat Das,Arghya Nandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes deep learning-based surrogate models, specifically a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder and a BiLSTM-Transformer hybrid, to rapidly and accurately predict creep strain in Inconel 625 alloys, replacing computationally expensive finite-element simulations in ANSYS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finite-element creep simulations for high-temperature alloys like Inconel 625 in tools such as ANSYS are computationally expensive, often taking tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run, which hinders design optimization and reliability assessment in aerospace and energy systems.

Method: Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses (50–150 MPa) and temperatures (700–1000°C). This dataset was used to train two deep learning architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM-Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior.

Result: Both models act as effective surrogate predictors. The BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable probabilistic creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong deterministic accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests show substantial speedup: ANSYS simulations take 30–40 minutes per condition, whereas the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed deep-learning surrogate framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring in high-temperature alloy applications, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional finite-element simulations.

Abstract: Time-dependent deformation, particularly creep, in high-temperature alloys such as Inconel 625 is a key factor in the long-term reliability of components used in aerospace and energy systems. Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications.

*Salar Beigzad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFF learning enhances Forward-Forward algorithm with inter-layer collaboration, improving performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inter-layer isolation in Forward-Forward algorithm that limits convergence in deeper networks.

Method: Introduces Fixed CFF (constant coupling) and Adaptive CFF (learnable parameters) with collaborative goodness function.

Result: Significant performance improvements on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

Conclusion: Inter-layer collaboration is a fundamental enhancement for Forward-Forward learning, applicable to neuromorphic and energy-constrained systems.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm eliminates backpropagation's memory constraints and biological implausibility through dual forward passes with positive and negative data. However, conventional implementations suffer from critical inter-layer isolation, where layers optimize goodness functions independently without leveraging collective learning dynamics. This isolation constrains representational coordination and limits convergence efficiency in deeper architectures. This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations. These findings establish inter-layer collaboration as a fundamental enhancement to Forward-Forward learning, with immediate applicability to neuromorphic computing architectures and energy-constrained AI systems.

TL;DR: New Bayesian optimisation methods for decoupled constraints outperform state-of-the-art by evaluating only binding constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimisation is powerful for expensive global black-box optimisation, but existing methods may not efficiently handle problems with decoupled black-box constraints where only a few constraints are binding at the optimum.

Method: Propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions that evaluate only relevant constraints by leveraging the decoupled nature of constraints.

Result: Empirical benchmarking shows the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The new methods effectively optimise functions with decoupled constraints by selectively evaluating relevant constraints, demonstrating superiority over existing techniques.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation has proven to be a powerful tool for expensive global black-box optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.

*Mahesh Keswani,Raunak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRPL framework improves SafeRL for autonomous driving by using predictive safety models, showing better reward-safety tradeoffs and generalization in real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SafeRL faces a fundamental tension between performance optimization and strict safety requirements in autonomous driving, needing better approaches.

Method: The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework equips agents with predictive models of future constraint violations.

Result: SRPL improves success rates and reduces costs with significant effect sizes (r=0.65-0.86 and r=0.70-0.83 respectively, p<0.05) on WOMD and NuPlan datasets, enhancing robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Predictive safety representations in SRPL show strong potential to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving, though effectiveness depends on policy optimizers and data distribution.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.

*Arthur Guijt,Dirk Thierens,Ellen Kerkhof,Jan Wiersma,Tanja Alderliesten,Peter A. N. Bosman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigates asynchronous model collaboration via stitching layers to address data fragmentation issues in federated learning, showing competitive performance while maintaining generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data fragmentation across parties (e.g., medical domain) prevents sharing, and federated learning requires synchronous training. Asynchronous collaboration using pre-trained models is unexplored.

Method: Proposes stitching layers to combine intermediate representations of individually trained models, evaluated from a multi-objective perspective on each party's data.

Result: Stitching recovers competitive performance on each party's own data while improving generalization to other parties' data, outperforming individual training or ensembles.

Conclusion: Asynchronous collaboration with stitching is viable for fragmented data settings, balancing personalized and generalized performance without synchronous training.

Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be very capable at performing many real-world tasks. However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.
  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze neural networks in the limiting case where both the number of neurons per layer and number of hidden layers approach infinity, forming a continuum representation.

Method: Derives integral infinite width neural representations, extends to deep residual CNNs, formalizes approximation errors via discretization, and creates a unified DiPaNet representation.

Result: Shows that most existing finite and infinite-dimensional NN architectures are related through homogenization/discretization with the DiPaNet framework.

Conclusion: The DiPaNet framework provides a deterministic approach applicable to general matrix weight functions, with potential generalizations and applications discussed.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the limiting case of neural networks (NNs) architectures when the number of neurons in each hidden layer and the number of hidden layers tend to infinity thus forming a continuum, and we derive approximation errors as a function of the number of neurons and/or hidden layers. Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation. Our approach is purely deterministic and applies to general, uniformly continuous matrix weight functions. Differences and similarities with neural fields are discussed along with further possible generalizations and applications of the DiPaNet framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithms increasingly operate in complex systems with disturbances, noise, and interconnections, but existing convergence guarantees typically assume isolation. There is a need to systematically analyze algorithmic performance under such realistic conditions.

Method: The authors leverage converse Lyapunov theorems to derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances on algorithmic convergence and stability.

Result: The paper provides stability bounds and convergence rates for algorithms operating under disturbances, demonstrating applicability in distributed learning (communication constraints), machine learning generalization (sensitivity), and privacy (noise injection).

Conclusion: The derived results serve as a unifying tool for analyzing algorithms in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems, extending the applicability of classical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.

Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in Interventional Radiology and Cardiology. Therefore, we present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a deep learning model that can approximate nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity while preserving global smoothness and maintaining a probabilistic interpretation.

Method: A deep learning architecture using polyharmonic splines derived from random function theory, trained by solving global linear systems on each batch rather than gradient descent.

Result: Fast learning without overfitting on MNIST dataset, with efficient 2D matrix operations executed on GPU.

Conclusion: The polyharmonic cascade architecture offers a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based deep learning, providing both theoretical rigor and practical efficiency for complex function approximation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep machine learning architecture, the "polyharmonic cascade" -- a sequence of packages of polyharmonic splines, where each layer is rigorously derived from the theory of random functions and the principles of indifference. This makes it possible to approximate nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity while preserving global smoothness and a probabilistic interpretation. For the polyharmonic cascade, a training method alternative to gradient descent is proposed: instead of directly optimizing the coefficients, one solves a single global linear system on each batch with respect to the function values at fixed "constellations" of nodes. This yields synchronized updates of all layers, preserves the probabilistic interpretation of individual layers and theoretical consistency with the original model, and scales well: all computations reduce to 2D matrix operations efficiently executed on a GPU. Fast learning without overfitting on MNIST is demonstrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding for SARSA in federated reinforcement learning settings with heterogeneous local transitions and rewards.

Method: Developed a novel multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA and analyzed FedSARSA with local training under heterogeneity.

Result: Proved convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates and quantified heterogeneity impact; showed linear speed-up with number of agents (up to Markovian sampling effects).

Conclusion: FedSARSA achieves efficient convergence with theoretical guarantees in heterogeneous federated RL settings, supported by numerical validation.

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical analysis of Federated SARSA (FedSARSA) with linear function approximation and local training. We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: A spatially-informed transformer combining geostatistical priors with neural networks achieves superior spatio-temporal forecasting with calibrated uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dichotomy between probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics (computationally prohibitive) and flexible deep learning (lacks geometric inductive bias) for modeling high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes.

Method: A hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel, decomposing attention into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks, demonstrating 'Deep Variography' where the network recovers true spatial decay parameters end-to-end.

Conclusion: The proposed spatially-informed transformer effectively bridges the gap between probabilistic geostatistical rigor and flexible deep learning, delivering superior predictive accuracy and well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts.

Abstract: The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.

TL;DR: LaLoRA applies Laplace approximation to LoRA weights for regularization, preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA that lose prior domain knowledge when specializing to downstream tasks.

Method: Laplace approximation applied only to LoRA weights estimates parameter confidence and constrains updates in high-curvature directions.

Result: Improved learning-forgetting trade-off controllable via regularization strength, tested on Llama for mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: LaLoRA effectively preserves prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning through selective regularization.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enable fast specialization of large pre-trained models to different downstream applications. However, this process often leads to catastrophic forgetting of the model's prior domain knowledge. We address this issue with LaLoRA, a weight-space regularization technique that applies a Laplace approximation to Low-Rank Adaptation. Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength. We further explore different loss landscape curvature approximations for estimating parameter confidence, analyze the effect of the data used for the Laplace approximation, and study robustness across hyperparameters.

Method: Introduces ECHO benchmark with three synthetic graph tasks (shortest paths, eccentricity, diameter) on challenging topologies, plus two real-world chemical datasets (ECHO-Charge, ECHO-Energy) with DFT-level reference computations.

Result: Benchmarking reveals clear performance gaps in popular GNN architectures, showing difficulty with true long-range propagation while highlighting effective design choices.

Conclusion: ECHO sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation in GNNs and demonstrates its importance for AI in science.

Abstract: Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.

TL;DR: Proposes a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) for multi-instance partial-label learning to improve both classification accuracy and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-instance partial-label learning approaches suffer from poor calibration, which undermines classifier reliability.

Method: Two instantiations of CDL: one calibrates predictions using probabilities from candidate label set, the other integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. It can be incorporated into existing frameworks.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows CDL has lower bound and regularization properties superior to conventional losses. Experiments confirm significant improvements in classification and calibration.

Conclusion: CDL effectively addresses calibration issues in MIPL while maintaining high classification performance, making it a valuable enhancement for weakly supervised learning.

Abstract: Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is a weakly supervised framework that extends the principles of multi-instance learning (MIL) and partial-label learning (PLL) to address the challenges of inexact supervision in both instance and label spaces. However, existing MIPL approaches often suffer from poor calibration, undermining classifier reliability. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm that our CDL significantly enhances both classification and calibration performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simple ensemble of ID- and text-based models outperforms complex fusion strategies, showing both features are necessary but no complex fusion needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of understanding about complementarity between ID and modality features in sequential recommendation models

Method: Propose independent training of ID- and text-based models with simple ensembling strategy

Result: Proposed method outperforms competitive SR baselines

Conclusion: Both ID and text features are necessary for state-of-the-art SR performance, but complex fusion architectures are not required

Abstract: Modern Sequential Recommendation (SR) models commonly utilize modality features to represent items, motivated in large part by recent advancements in language and vision modeling. To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not.

TL;DR: Proposes a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) method with finite element reconstruction (RRFF-FEM) to learn operators from noisy data, offering robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel-based operator learning is accurate but computationally expensive for large datasets and sensitive to noise, needing a scalable and noise-resistant approach.

Method: Uses random features from multivariate Student's t distributions with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization to suppress high-frequency noise.

Result: The method ensures well-conditioned systems with theoretical guarantees; experiments on PDE problems show improved robustness, reduced training time, and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: RRFF and RRFF-FEM provide an effective, scalable solution for operator learning from noisy data, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Operator learning is a data-driven approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, such as the solution operators of partial differential equations. Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.

*Monika Zamojska,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Transactional Analysis-based multi-agent system with ego states and information retrieval to enhance psychological realism in LLM-powered agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents currently lack psychological depth and consistency to model real human thinking, missing deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations in interactions, limiting their use in social, political, and psychological research and group dynamics simulations.

Method: The paper integrates Transactional Analysis theory by dividing each agent into three ego states (Parent, Adult, Child) as separate knowledge structures with distinct perspectives and reasoning styles, and incorporates an information retrieval mechanism to access relevant contextual information from vector stores, with evaluation through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario comparing agents with and without retrieval.

Result: The results are promising, showing that the proposed architecture enhances agent realism, opening new directions for exploring psychologically grounded structures in multi-agent simulations, as demonstrated through experimental comparisons.

Conclusion: The contribution is an agent architecture combining Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to improve the realism of LLM-based multi-agent systems, addressing current limitations in psychological modeling and enabling more accurate simulations of human-like social behavior.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are now used in many areas, from customer support to education, and there is increasing interest in their ability to act more like humans. This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like evolutionary rules or value-based RL struggle with payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations.

Method: Uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) with a centralized critic for joint strategy evaluation, and MAPPO-LCR adds local cooperation rewards for policy alignment.

Result: Simulations show stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence; statistical analyses confirm MAPPO's learning advantage over PPO.

Conclusion: MAPPO and MAPPO-LCR effectively handle spatial public goods games, enabling cooperative behavior through decentralized execution with centralized training.

Abstract: Spatial public goods games model collective dilemmas where individual payoffs depend on population-level strategy configurations. Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.

*Abhivansh Gupta*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A paper proposing a Verifiability-First architecture for secure LLM-based agents, with an OPERA benchmark suite for evaluating detectability and remediation of misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring controllability, auditability, and faithfulness to deployer intent as LLM-based agents become more autonomous and multi-modal.

Method: Verifiability-First architecture integrating run-time attestations, lightweight Audit Agents, and challenge-response protocols; includes OPERA benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Proposes an approach shifting evaluation from misalignment likelihood to detection and remediation speed and reliability.

Conclusion: The architecture and OPERA benchmark aim to enhance security and trust in autonomous LLM-based agents by enabling timely detection and remediation of misaligned behaviors.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents grow more autonomous and multi-modal, ensuring they remain controllable, auditable, and faithful to deployer intent becomes critical. Prior benchmarks measured the propensity for misaligned behavior and showed that agent personalities and tool access significantly influence misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose a Verifiability-First architecture that (1) integrates run-time attestations of agent actions using cryptographic and symbolic methods, (2) embeds lightweight Audit Agents that continuously verify intent versus behavior using constrained reasoning, and (3) enforces challenge-response attestation protocols for high-risk operations. We introduce OPERA (Observability, Provable Execution, Red-team, Attestation), a benchmark suite and evaluation protocol designed to measure (i) detectability of misalignment, (ii) time to detection under stealthy strategies, and (iii) resilience of verifiability mechanisms to adversarial prompt and persona injection. Our approach shifts the evaluation focus from how likely misalignment is to how quickly and reliably misalignment can be detected and remediated.
