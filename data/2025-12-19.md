### [1] [Emergence: Overcoming Privileged Information Bias in Asymmetric Embodied Agents via Active Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15776)
*Shaun Baek,Sam Liu,Joseph Ukpong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows LLMs struggle with symbol grounding in asymmetric environments due to Privileged Information Bias, proposing a Pull-based communication protocol that doubles success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack Theory of Mind when guiding sensor-limited agents, failing to effectively transfer knowledge in collaborative tasks due to asymmetric information distribution.

Method: Developed Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework in AI2-THOR to measure Privileged Information Bias through Leader-Follower experiments comparing Push vs Pull communication protocols.

Result: Pull-based protocol (active querying) achieved 2x higher success rates than Push-based, with successful episodes featuring twice as many clarification requests.

Conclusion: Active uncertainty reduction through Pull-based communication is essential for overcoming symbol grounding challenges in human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

### [2] [Anubuddhi: A Multi-Agent AI System for Designing and Simulating Quantum Optics Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736)
*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anubuddhi is a multi-agent AI system that uses natural language prompts to design and simulate quantum optics experiments without programming, achieving high design-simulation alignment through semantic retrieval and physics simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize computational experiment design in quantum optics by enabling users without specialized programming knowledge to create and validate experiments via natural language, bridging the gap between conceptual ideas and practical simulation.

Method: The architecture employs intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and semantic retrieval to arrange optical components from a three-tier toolbox, validating designs through physics simulation with QuTiP and FreeSim for convergent refinement.

Result: Evaluation of 13 experiments, including Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and boson sampling, shows design-simulation alignment scores of 8–9/10, with free-form simulation outperforming constrained frameworks in 11 out of 13 cases, indicating flexible mathematical representations are crucial for quantum optics diversity.

Conclusion: Anubuddhi successfully democratizes quantum optics design for research and education, producing robust initial designs that users can iteratively refine. It highlights the distinction between structural correctness and quantitative accuracy, emphasizing the need for expert review for numerical precision.

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

### [3] [AMUSE: Audio-Visual Benchmark and Alignment Framework for Agentic Multi-Speaker Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16250)
*Sanjoy Chowdhury,Karren D. Yang,Xudong Liu,Fartash Faghri,Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu,Oncel Tuzel,Dinesh Manocha,Chun-Liang Li,Raviteja Vemulapalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces AMUSE benchmark and RAFT framework to address MLLMs' weaknesses in multi-speaker audiovisual reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with agentic reasoning in multi-speaker dialogue scenarios requiring tracking speakers, roles, and temporal grounding across audio-visual streams.

Method: Created AMUSE benchmark with diverse tasks and evaluation modes, plus RAFT framework combining reward optimization with multimodal self-evaluation for efficient agentic alignment.

Result: Current models perform poorly on AMUSE, but RAFT achieves up to 39.52% relative improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: AMUSE and RAFT provide effective tools for evaluating and enhancing agentic reasoning capabilities in multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

### [4] [The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740)
*Timothy Prescher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a framework showing ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state, converting Action Duty to Repair Duty as uncertainty increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty by treating it as a constraint, lacking a dynamic approach to moral responsibility.

Method: The PPD is formalized with a mathematical equation for Total Duty involving Knowledge, Humility/Uncertainty, and Contextual Signal Strength, supported by Monte Carlo simulations to test stability.

Result: Systems with a humility coefficient produce more stable duty allocations and reduce overconfident decisions; the framework proves applicable in clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and AI.

Conclusion: The PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility, serving as a stabilizing principle in complex systems by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence and contextual risk.

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

### [5] [Prompt-to-Parts: Generative AI for Physical Assembly and Scalable Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15743)
*David Noever*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language using discrete parts vocabulary and LLMs with LDraw representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output by addressing limitations of pixel-based diffusion methods and CAD models in supporting complex assembly instructions.

Method: Uses LDraw as text-rich intermediate representation with guided LLMs to produce valid construction sequences, plus Python library for programmatic model generation.

Result: Successfully generates assembly instructions for complex designs (satellites, aircraft, architecture) with over 3000 parts, demonstrating scalability and modularity.

Conclusion: The 'bag of bricks' method serves as a physical API, enabling natural language to compile into material reality while opening new design options for manufacturing.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

### [6] [AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783)
*Kit Tempest-Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Epidemiology applies epidemiological surveillance methods to AI governance, using statistical analysis of AI outputs rather than internal model inspection to detect unreliable AI behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods struggle with complex deployed models, creating governance gaps as AI systems scale.

Method: Standardizes capture of AI-expert interactions into risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score fields that function as exposure variables predicting output failure through statistical associations.

Result: Enables detection of unreliable AI outputs through validation against expert overrides and real-world outcomes, providing automatic audit trails and governance continuity across model updates.

Conclusion: AI Epidemiology democratizes AI oversight by allowing domain experts to govern systems without ML expertise, providing practical governance for complex AI deployments.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

### [7] [Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784)
*Zibin Liu,Cheng Zhang,Xi Zhao,Yunfei Feng,Bingyu Bai,Dahu Feng,Erhu Feng,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOBIMEM proposes a memory-centric agent system using specialized memory primitives and OS-inspired services to enable self-evolution without model retraining, achieving faster personalization, higher task success, and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with self-evolution post-deployment, requiring costly model retraining and facing trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Introduces three memory primitives (Profile, Experience, Action Memory) and OS-inspired services (scheduler, AgentRR, exception handling) to decouple evolution from model weights.

Result: Achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83ms retrieval (280x faster than baselines), 50.3% higher task success, and 9x lower latency on mobile devices.

Conclusion: MOBIMEM enables efficient, continuous agent self-evolution without model retraining, improving personalization, capability, and efficiency in real-world environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

### [8] [State-Augmented Graphs for Circular Economy Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15824)
*Richard Fox,Rui Li,Gustav Jonsson,Farzaneh Goli,Miying Yang,Emel Aktas,Yongjing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel decision-making framework for circular economy triage using a state-augmented DSP graph to optimize product disassembly and sustainability pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions balancing retained value against costs and constraints; current methods lack a unified approach for optimal, recursive evaluation.

Method: Develops a deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning graph, encoding disassembly history to enforce Markov property, with choices between continuing disassembly or CE options.

Result: The framework demonstrates flexibility through an example of hierarchical triage for EV batteries, enabling accommodation of mechanical complexity, safety, and economic factors.

Conclusion: The unified formalism provides a tractable and generalizable foundation for optimizing CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

### [9] [PediatricAnxietyBench: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Under Parental Anxiety and Pressure in Pediatric Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15894)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evaluation of LLM safety for pediatric advice under parental pressure using PediatricAnxietyBench benchmark shows significant vulnerabilities, with larger models performing better but still having critical failures, especially with adversarial queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used by parents for pediatric guidance, but their safety under real-world adversarial pressures like urgent language and parental anxiety is poorly understood.

Method: Used PediatricAnxietyBench benchmark with 300 queries across 10 pediatric topics, assessing two Llama models (70B and 8B) with a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition.

Result: Mean safety score was 5.50/15; 70B model outperformed 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95) with fewer critical failures; adversarial queries reduced safety by 8%, with urgency causing the largest drop; vulnerabilities in seizure and post-vaccination queries; hedging correlated with safety, while emergency recognition was absent.

Conclusion: Model scale influences safety, but all models show vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures; PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes missed by standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

### [10] [Darth Vecdor: An Open-Source System for Generating Knowledge Graphs Through Large Language Model Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15906)
*Jonathan A. Handler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Darth Vecdor (DV) extracts structured knowledge from LLMs into SQL databases to address reliability and efficiency concerns, offering a user-friendly interface for healthcare applications despite potential risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct LLM queries face issues like cost, speed, safety, and confidence in high-volume operations, especially in domains like healthcare, necessitating pre-extracted, structured knowledge.

Method: DV mitigates LLM response problems (e.g., errors, inconsistencies) by mapping knowledge into a SQL database and providing a browser-based GUI for easy prompt engineering by non-technical users.

Result: DV is released as open-source software with warnings about potential serious bugs, emphasizing user responsibility for safe use, but aims to benefit healthcare through structured knowledge access.

Conclusion: While acknowledging risks, DV's structured approach could improve healthcare by making LLM knowledge more reliable and accessible, with future versions expected to enhance utility.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.

### [11] [Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922)
*Jovan Pavlović,Miklós Krész,László Hajdu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel RAG framework using spreading activation on knowledge graphs improves complex reasoning tasks, outperforming iterative RAG while being easily integrable and effective with small language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems struggle with multi-step reasoning due to treating all retrieved information equally and lacking credibility assessment. GraphRAG approaches have limitations in graph quality and traversal reliability.

Method: The framework employs spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from documents connected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, enhancing LLM performance on complex tasks like multi-hop QA.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG, with up to 39% absolute gain in answer correctness when combined with chain-of-thought retrieval, using small open-weight models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses RAG limitations for complex reasoning, offering improved performance, easy integration, and efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

*Polaris Jhandi,Owais Kazi,Shreyas Subramanian,Neel Sendas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SLMs can replace LLMs in enterprise workflows with 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench, reducing costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of LLMs limit enterprise adoption; SLMs offer cost-effective alternative for targeted tasks.

Method: Fine-tuned facebook/opt-350m model using Hugging Face TRL's SFT trainer for document summarization, QA, and data interpretation tasks.

Result: Fine-tuned SLM achieved 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench, outperforming ChatGPT-CoT (26.00%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27%).

Conclusion: Thoughtful SLM design enables cost-effective AI integration, lowering adoption barriers for production systems.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

### [13] [Subjective functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15948)
*Samuel J. Gershman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes the concept of a 'subjective function' as an endogenous, higher-order objective function for agents, exploring its connections to psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, with expected prediction error as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses fundamental questions about the origin and selection of objective functions: 'Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue?' It highlights human intelligence's ability to synthesize new objective functions on the fly and asks how this process works and whether artificial systems can be endowed with the same capability.

Method: The paper proposes an approach starting with the concept of a 'subjective function,' defined as a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent, meaning it is defined with respect to the agent's features rather than an external task. It investigates expected prediction error as a concrete example of a subjective function.

Result: The proposal connects the concept of subjective functions to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, suggesting a framework for understanding and replicating adaptive goal-setting in artificial systems.

Conclusion: The paper offers a novel approach to understanding the emergence of objective functions by introducing subjective functions, with the aim of advancing the development of adaptive, human-like intelligence in artificial systems.

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

### [14] [Conversational Time Series Foundation Models: Towards Explainable and Effective Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16022)
*Defu Cao,Michael Gee,Jinbo Liu,Hengxuan Wang,Wei Yang,Rui Wang,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uses an LLM as an intelligent judge to coordinate an interpretable ensemble of time series models, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in time series foundation models, where no single method consistently excels, by creating an interpretable ensemble approach, but direct application of LLMs to time series forecasting is ineffective.

Method: Reposition the LLM as an intelligent judge to evaluate, explain, and strategically coordinate an ensemble of foundation models, with an R1-style finetuning process guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores to interpret ensemble weights as causal statements, followed by iterative multi-turn conversations for forward-looking assessments and adaptive refinement.

Result: Significant outperformance on the GIFT-Eval benchmark across 23 datasets and 97 settings, with improved CRPS and MASE metrics.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the GIFT-Eval benchmark, outperforming leading time series foundation models in both CRPS and MASE metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of using an LLM as an intelligent judge for ensemble coordination.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

*Lukas Nel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models show systematic overconfidence in predicting future events despite good accuracy, with scaling and enhanced reasoning not improving calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large language models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events, unlike traditional benchmarks that measure accuracy on static knowledge.

Method: Created KalshiBench benchmark with 300 prediction market questions from a regulated exchange, evaluated five frontier models on their calibration using metrics like ECE and Brier Skill Score.

Result: All models showed systematic overconfidence, with Claude Opus 4.5 being best but still having substantial errors (ECE=0.120), and reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh performing worse (ECE=0.395). Only one model achieved positive Brier Skill Score.

Conclusion: Epistemic calibration is a distinct capability not automatically improved by scaling or enhanced reasoning, requiring targeted development.

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

*Diane Myung-kyung Woodbridge,Allyson Seba,Freddie Seba,Aydin Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed an automated system using topic modeling and LLMs to analyze AI policies in education, achieving high classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid adoption of GenAI in education creates policy inconsistencies, leaving students uncertain about proper usage guidelines.

Method: Combined unsupervised topic modeling with GPT-4 classification to categorize policies from syllabi and institutional websites.

Result: System achieved 0.73 coherence score for topic discovery and 0.92-0.97 precision/0.85-0.97 recall across 8 policy categories.

Conclusion: Tool provides structured policy analysis to promote safe, equitable GenAI integration in education.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

TL;DR: WeMusic-Agent is a training framework for LLM-based conversational music recommendation that balances internal knowledge and tool use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration in personalized music recommendation.

Method: Integrates knowledge internalization (continued pretraining on 50B music corpus) and agentic boundary learning to decide when to use internal knowledge vs external tools.

Result: Significant improvements over existing models demonstrated on real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables intelligent decision-making between internal knowledge and tool invocation for conversational music recommendation.

Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.

Conclusion: ToolForge provides a cost-effective, high-quality solution for training LLMs in tool-calling, with open-sourced code and dataset, advancing efficient AI tool-learning.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks.

*Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We propose a Weighted K-Harmonic Means (WKHM) clustering algorithm that offers numerically stable soft assignments via inverse-distance weighting, with applications in wireless networks for user association, convergence proofs under deterministic and stochastic settings, and superior performance in simulations compared to existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a clustering algorithm that ensures numerical stability, allows soft assignments, and has a direct interpretation in wireless networks for fractional user association based on signal strength, overcoming limitations of classical K-means and constrained K-means by transforming K-harmonic means into a regularized variant for improved robustness and applicability.

Method: Introduction of the Weighted K-Harmonic Means (WKHM) algorithm, which applies inverse-distance weighting for soft assignments and includes regularization to prevent instability. Convergence is analyzed under deterministic conditions with monotone descent to local minima, and stochastic settings with initializations based on Binomial Point Process (BPP) and decay conditions, using rigorous proofs to address non-convexity and random initialization challenges.

Result: Convergence is proven under fixed initialization (monotone descent to local minimum), BPP initialization (convergence in probability), and decay conditions (almost sure convergence), providing the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Simulations show WKHM achieves a better tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines across diverse user distributions.

Conclusion: WKHM is a principled and effective algorithm for clustering with applications in wireless networks, offering numerical stability, soft assignments, direct interpretability for user association, robust convergence guarantees, and superior performance in balancing signal strength and fairness, making it suitable for joint radio node placement and user association tasks.

Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.

*Jianming Liu,Ren Zhu,Jian Xu,Kun Ding,Xu-Yao Zhang,Gaofeng Meng,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDE-Agent is a novel multi-agent framework using LLMs and external tools to automate PDE solving from natural language, outperforming prior methods in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solving methods are manual and expert-dependent, while existing neural approaches like PINNs still lack full autonomy.

Method: Introduces PDE-Agent with Prog-Act framework for dynamic planning/error correction and Resource-Pool for tool coordination.

Result: PDE-Agent shows superior applicability and performance in complex PDE tasks, validated via PDE-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: This toolchain-augmented multi-agent paradigm advances automated scientific computing.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: SPRITE introduces a framework using simulators and LLMs to generate scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data, overcoming limitations of traditional template-based or manual annotation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have limited spatial understanding due to rigid template-based datasets or unscalable manual annotation, creating a need for precise, diverse, and scalable spatial reasoning data.

Method: SPRITE reframes ground-truth generation as a code-generation task, using LLMs to compile spatial questions into executable programs verified against scene meta-information from simulators.

Result: A dataset with 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ pairs was created; VLMs trained on this data show significant gains on spatial benchmarks and outperform other open-source datasets of similar size.

Conclusion: SPRITE effectively addresses the dilemma in spatial data generation, enabling robust and generalizable spatial intelligence, with framework code and dataset to be publicly released.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

*Aniruddha Roy,Jyoti Patel,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlignMerge is a geometry-aware merging framework that preserves alignment while combining LLMs, outperforming existing methods on safety and performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard model merging techniques can degrade alignment properties even when preserving loss, requiring explicit geometric constraints to maintain safety.

Method: Uses Fisher-Rao geometry around an aligned base model with alignment subspace projection, optimizing a loss function combining geometric proximity, alignment preservation, and budget constraints via the AQI metric.

Result: Outperforms Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge and MergeAlign across 5 model families, improving alignment metrics while maintaining/exceeding expert performance on instruction-following and reasoning.

Conclusion: Alignment-preserving merging should be a primary design goal, with geometry-aware composition providing a path forward for foundation model development.

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents learn to predict precise waiting times through semantic priors and ICL, enabling synchronization with asynchronous environments without constant polling, reducing query overhead and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agentic tasks involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a Temporal Gap. Existing environment-side solutions like blocking wrappers or frequent polling limit scalability or dilute context windows with redundant observations.

Method: Extend Code-as-Action paradigm to temporal domain; agents use semantic priors and In-Context Learning to predict waiting durations (time.sleep(t)) for synchronization.

Result: Experiments in simulated Kubernetes cluster show agents can precisely calibrate internal clocks to minimize query overhead and execution latency.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuadSentinel is a four-agent guardrail system that converts natural language safety policies into machine-checkable rules for better protection against risks in LLM-based agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks exist in LLM-based agents due to ambiguous natural language policies that are hard to enforce reliably at runtime.

Method: Uses four specialized agents (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, referee) to compile policies into observable predicates and enforce them efficiently with hierarchical conflict resolution.

Result: Improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives on benchmark tests compared to single-agent baselines.

Conclusion: QuadSentinel provides effective safety control that can be deployed without modifying core agents, keeping policies separate and machine-checkable.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces OS-Oracle, a critic model framework addressing GUI action verification in computer-using agents, featuring a data pipeline, training method, and benchmark, achieving SOTA performance and enhancing GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Errors in GUI navigation accumulate in long tasks, and irreversible actions risk consequences, necessitating critic models to evaluate actions pre-execution, but data and benchmarks for step-level evaluation are lacking.

Method: Develops OS-Oracle with a scalable data pipeline for cross-platform GUI critic data, a two-stage training paradigm (SFT and CP-GRPO), and OS-Critic Bench for evaluation across platforms.

Result: Curated 310k critic samples; OS-Oracle-7B model achieves SOTA among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, beats proprietary models in mobile domain, and improves GUI agents like UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: OS-Oracle effectively bridges gaps in GUI critic modeling, providing a robust framework for reliable step-level decision-making in CUAs, with open-sourced code for broader adoption.

Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/numbmelon/OS-Oracle.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ForenAgent is a multi-round interactive image forgery detection framework that uses MLLMs to generate and refine Python-based low-level tools, combining high-level semantics with low-level artifacts through a dynamic reasoning loop, trained via a two-stage pipeline and validated on the FABench dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFD methods suffer from a gap between low-level artifacts and high-level semantic knowledge provided by MLLMs, as these information streams are heterogeneous in paradigm and reasoning, lacking effective unification or cross-level interaction modeling.

Method: Propose ForenAgent, which enables MLLMs to autonomously create, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools for forgery analysis. Uses a two-stage training pipeline (Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning) and a dynamic reasoning loop (global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, holistic adjudication) implemented as data-sampling and reward strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning in challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, showing effectiveness toward general-purpose forgery detection.

Conclusion: ForenAgent charts a promising route for general-purpose IFD by bridging semantic and artifact-based approaches through agent-driven tool interaction, with code to be released post-review.

Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

### [29] [Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317)
*Arther Tian,Alex Ding,Frank Chen,Alan Wu,Aaron Chan,Bruce Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-aware Proof of Quality (PoQ) framework for decentralized LLM inference, integrating efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both inference and evaluator nodes to ensure economic sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized LLM inference aims for transparent and censorship-resistant AI access, but existing verification methods fall short for modern models. PoQ shifts to consensus over output quality but overlooks heterogeneous computational costs among nodes, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed cost-aware PoQ framework incorporates ground truth token-level F1 scores, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT-based judgments into a unified evaluation pipeline. It uses a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost. Experiments involve five LLMs (TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B) and three evaluator models on tasks like extractive question answering and abstractive summarization, with Monte Carlo simulations over 5,000 PoQ rounds to test the reward scheme.

Result: A semantic textual similarity bi-encoder evaluator correlates significantly better with ground truth and GPT scores than cross-encoders, highlighting evaluator architecture as key. Quality-cost analysis reveals the largest models are most efficient per latency unit. Simulations show the cost-aware reward scheme awards higher rewards to high-quality, low-cost inference models and efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow, low-quality nodes.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that cost-aware PoQ offers a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference by effectively aligning rewards with both output quality and computational efficiency of nodes, addressing scalability and heterogeneity issues.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

### [30] [AI Needs Physics More Than Physics Needs AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16344)
*Peter Coveney,Roger Highfield*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI's overstated impact, noting its limitations in scientific validity, and proposes 'Big AI' combining theoretical rigor with ML flexibility as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between AI's promotional hype and its actual modest technical impact outside few domains, highlighting how physics can better contribute to advancing AI rather than vice versa.

Method: Review of current AI architectures' limitations (e.g., meaningless parameters, bias, lack of uncertainty quantification) and analysis of opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing.

Result: Identification of key flaws in contemporary AI systems and a proposed roadmap for 'Big AI' that integrates theory-based approaches with machine learning.

Conclusion: Physics offers more to current AI than AI does to physics; adopting 'Big AI' could overcome existing limitations and foster meaningful advancements.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.

Conclusion: PCIA is an effective and competitive metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by human path-building behavior, suitable for various optimization tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Achieves up to 95% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks, demonstrating flexible adaptation to user constraints and accounting for chemical feasibility.

Conclusion: Synthelite is envisioned as both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

*Yadong Li,Tong Zhang,Bo Huang,Zhen Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SC2BA, a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment for benchmarking MARL algorithms in adversarial modes, addressing limitations of fixed AI opponents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL benchmarks like SMAC use fixed built-in AI for opponents, leading to less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation.

Method: Developed SC2BA environment with fairness, usability, and customizability, and created APyMARL library with easy-to-use interfaces. Benchmarked classic MARL algorithms in dual-algorithm paired and multi-algorithm mixed adversarial modes.

Result: Extensive experiments revealed thought-provoking observations on algorithm effectivity, sensibility, and scalability in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: SC2BA marks a new step for MARL benchmarking, with potential to advance the field through open-sourced environment and experiments.

Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for interpreting time-series data, but their application to real-world battery energy storage system operation remains unexplored.

Method: TS2R encodes temporal dynamics into natural language through segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation to bridge sensor signals with contextual insights.

Result: TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in accuracy, robustness, and explainability across anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management tasks.

Conclusion: TS2R enables LLMs to achieve expert-level decision quality without retraining, establishing a practical path for LLM-driven battery intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

*Jinwu Chen,Qidie Wu,Bin Li,Lin Ma,Xin Si,Yang Hu,Shouyi Yin,Jun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: cuPilot is a multi-agent framework that uses strategy-coordinated evolution to optimize CUDA kernels, achieving 3.09x speedup over PyTorch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based kernel optimization approaches suffer from poor agent designs and mismatched evolution representations.

Method: Proposes strategy as intermediate semantic representation, strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization.

Result: Average 3.09x speedup over PyTorch on 100 kernels; GEMM tasks show sophisticated optimizations and high hardware utilization.

Conclusion: cuPilot effectively addresses representation mismatches in kernel evolution and demonstrates significant performance improvements with open-sourced kernels.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a behavior-grounded metric using XAI to compare causal evidence in decisions for matched real-synthetic pairs, enhancing simulator calibration and revealing discrepancies missed by traditional fidelity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual testing for AV safety relies on synthetic data, but visual realism alone doesn't ensure reliable simulation-to-real transfer; current fidelity measures lack focus on causal evidence underlying system decisions across domains.

Method: Proposes DFF, a SUT-specific metric that leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare decisive features in matched real-synthetic pairs, with practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations and a DFF-guided calibration scheme.

Result: Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs show DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity, and DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

Conclusion: DFF extends the fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity, ensuring AV testing focuses on causal evidence behind decisions rather than just visual realism, enabling more robust simulation-to-real transfer in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing best practices for meta-algorithmics are scattered across publications and fields, making it hard to ensure scalable and valid experiments. This fragmentation threatens scientific validity due to experimental design errors.

Method: The authors collect and synthesize good practices from the COSEAL community subfields, covering the entire experimental lifecycle: research question formulation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and impartial presentation.

Result: The report establishes current state-of-the-art practices and creates a unified guideline for empirical meta-algorithmic research.

Conclusion: This work serves as a comprehensive resource to guide new researchers and practitioners, promoting rigorous and consistent experimentation in meta-algorithmics.

Abstract: Empirical research on meta-algorithmics, such as algorithm selection, configuration, and scheduling, often relies on extensive and thus computationally expensive experiments. With the large degree of freedom we have over our experimental setup and design comes a plethora of possible error sources that threaten the scalability and validity of our scientific insights. Best practices for meta-algorithmic research exist, but they are scattered between different publications and fields, and continue to evolve separately from each other. In this report, we collect good practices for empirical meta-algorithmic research across the subfields of the COSEAL community, encompassing the entire experimental cycle: from formulating research questions and selecting an experimental design, to executing ex- periments, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results impartially. It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ParamExplorer, an interactive framework using reinforcement learning principles to help artists explore complex parameter spaces in generative art, with evaluation of different exploration agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative art systems have high-dimensional parameter spaces where visually appealing outputs are scarce, forcing artists to rely on inefficient manual trial-and-error methods that miss many interesting configurations.

Method: The authors develop ParamExplorer, a modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that facilitates parameter space exploration through human-in-the-loop or automated feedback, with seamless integration to p5.js projects.

Result: Several exploration strategies (agents) were implemented and evaluated within the framework to demonstrate its effectiveness in navigating generative art parameter spaces.

Conclusion: ParamExplorer provides a systematic approach to discovering aesthetic outputs in generative art, addressing the limitations of manual exploration through interactive and automated guidance.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CPU-only inference scaling laws for local LLMs/VLMs: computational cost scales linearly with input length for LLMs, while VLMs show a resolution knee effect. Quantum-inspired compression reduces resource usage by up to 71.9% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most consumer hardware relies on CPUs rather than GPUs for AI deployment, but CPU-only inference scaling laws for local language and vision-language models remain unexplored despite their practical importance for edge devices.

Method: Systematic benchmarking on two CPU tiers (MacBook Pro M2 and Raspberry Pi 5) using continuous sampling of processor/memory usage with AUC integration to characterize computational load scaling with input length for LLMs and image resolution for VLMs.

Result: Identified two scaling laws: 1) LLM inference cost scales linearly with token length, 2) VLMs exhibit a resolution knee where compute remains constant above an internal clamp and drops sharply below it. Quantum-inspired compression achieves up to 71.9% reduction in processor/memory usage and 62% energy savings while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides first systematic quantification of multimodal CPU-only scaling for local AI workloads, identifying model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective low-cost strategies for sustainable edge inference.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

*Himanshu Gharat,Himanshi Agrawal,Gourab K. Patro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory-enhanced LLM agents can introduce and amplify bias in personalized systems, as demonstrated in a recruitment simulation using safety-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While memory enhances LLM agent capabilities through personalization, it may unintentionally introduce bias, an understudied risk area.

Method: Simulated behavior of memory-enhanced personalized agents in a recruitment use case across various operational stages.

Result: Experiments revealed systematic introduction and reinforcement of bias through personalization, even with safety-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Protective measures or agent guardrails are necessary to mitigate bias risks in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

*Yumeng Wang,Tianyu Fan,Lingrui Xu,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Needle in the Web, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs and search agents on fuzzy exploratory searches over real web content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks neglect fuzzy exploratory search - vague, multifaceted queries where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer.

Method: Created a benchmark with 663 questions across 7 domains using a flexible methodology to generate queries of controllable difficulty based on factual web content claims.

Result: Most models and search systems struggled, with many below 35% accuracy and none excelling consistently across domains or difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current systems, highlighting the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

### [45] [Prefix Probing: Lightweight Harmful Content Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16650)
*Jirui Yang,Hengqi Guo,Zhihui Lu,Yi Zhao,Yuansen Zhang,Shijing Hu,Qiang Duan,Yinggui Wang,Tao Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prefix Probing is a lightweight harmful content detection method that uses prefix probability comparisons and caching to achieve high accuracy with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face a trade-off between detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment costs in safety-sensitive applications, creating a need for efficient detection methods.

Method: The method compares conditional log-probabilities of 'agreement/execution' versus 'refusal/safety' prefixes using single log-probability computation and prefix caching, with an algorithm to automatically discover informative prefixes.

Result: Extensive experiments show Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to external safety models with minimal computational cost and no additional model deployment.

Conclusion: Prefix Probing offers strong practicality and efficiency for harmful content detection, balancing performance with low overhead.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

### [46] [Comprehensive AI Literacy: The Case for Centering Human Agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16656)
*Sri Yash Tadimalla,Justin Cary,Gordon Hull,Jordan Register,Daniel Maxwell,David Pugalee,Tina Heafner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes shifting AI education from functional skills to human agency-focused literacy, advocating for critical and ethical reasoning alongside frameworks for AI literacy, fluency, and competency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current educational frameworks fail to address the literacy gap created by AI adoption, where operational skills overshadow critical and ethical analysis, risking disempowered users.

Method: The paper argues for a systemic educational shift, introducing AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks that emphasize human agency for intentional and responsible AI interaction.

Result: The proposed frameworks aim to empower educators and students to make informed choices about AI use, fostering critical thinking and ethical considerations in academic and societal contexts.

Conclusion: True AI literacy requires centering human agency, rejecting inevitability, and emphasizing conscious decision-making to ensure responsible and critical AI engagement across all educational stakeholders.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how the Apriori algorithm can automatically group Islamic hadith texts into meaningful thematic categories like worship, revelation, and narration through association pattern mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to automate thematic grouping of hadith texts due to increasing digitalization of Islamic literature, requiring efficient methods to organize and analyze large collections.

Method: Unsupervised learning using Apriori algorithm with preprocessing (case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) and association rule mining with support, confidence, and lift parameters on Indonesian-translated Bukhari hadith dataset.

Result: The algorithm successfully identified meaningful association patterns including rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story relationships, revealing themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration.

Conclusion: The Apriori algorithm effectively uncovers latent semantic relationships in hadith texts, contributing to digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems development.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

*Mahbub E Sobhani,Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi,Mohammad Nehad Alam,Proma Hossain Progga,Swakkhar Shatabda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent pipelines consistently improve performance for open-source models on geometry problem-solving benchmarks, but show mixed results for proprietary models, with benefits mainly on newer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare the effectiveness of single-agent versus multi-agent designs for MLLMs on diagram-grounded geometry problem solving across multiple benchmarks.

Method: Comparative analysis of single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math using both open-source (Qwen-2.5-VL variants) and closed-source (Gemini-2.0-Flash) models.

Result: Open-source models gained significant improvements with multi-agent design (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL 7B: +6.8 points on Geometry3K). Proprietary Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performed better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, with only modest multi-agent gains on newer We-Math dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal across all models and datasets.

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cyber Humanism in Education framework to maintain human agency in AI-driven learning, introducing three design pillars and case studies showing enhanced epistemic agency with implementation tensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI tools are transforming education by creating hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and de-professionalization of educators.

Method: Conceptualizes AI-enabled learning as socio-technical infrastructures, proposes three design pillars (reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, dialogic design), and presents higher-education case studies using prompt-based learning and Conversational AI Educator certification.

Result: Case studies demonstrate strengthened epistemic agency but reveal tensions related to workload, equity, and governance in AI-enabled education.

Conclusion: The Cyber Humanism framework offers a pathway for human-centered AI education, emphasizing the role of educators and learners as algorithmic citizens who co-shape learning infrastructures.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.

### [50] [Dual Computational Horizons: Incompleteness and Unpredictability in Intelligent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16707)
*Abhisek Ganguly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two computational limits constrain intelligence: formal incompleteness (limits deductive reasoning) and dynamical unpredictability (limits long-term prediction). Together they prevent algorithmic agents from computing their own maximal prediction horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental constraints on algorithmic intelligence by examining two key computational limitations and their combined effects on self-analysis capabilities.

Method: Formalization of two independent computational limitations through theoretical analysis of algorithmic reasoning systems and prediction capabilities.

Result: Demonstrated that formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability jointly impose structural bounds preventing agents from computing their own maximal prediction horizon.

Conclusion: There are inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems that cannot be overcome algorithmically.

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for learning interpretable PDDL-style models of black-box AI systems to represent their sequential decision-making capabilities using Monte-Carlo tree search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box AI systems are increasingly used for sequential decision making, but their lack of interpretability raises safety concerns. There is a need for efficient methods to create sound and interpretable representations of these systems' capabilities.

Method: The approach uses Monte-Carlo tree search to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. The learned PDDL-style models describe capabilities, execution conditions, possible outcomes, and associated probabilities.

Result: Theoretical results demonstrate soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple black-box AI systems show the method's scope, efficiency, and accuracy.

Conclusion: PDDL-style representations can effectively model black-box AI planning capabilities, providing interpretable models that capture execution conditions and probabilistic outcomes while ensuring theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid ML-LLM pipeline accurately predicts breakthrough pain episodes in lung cancer patients from EHR data, improving sensitivity and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breakthrough pain is common in lung cancer, yet proactive management is challenging; better prediction tools are needed.

Method: Combined ML for temporal medication trends and LLM for interpreting unstructured EHR data like dosing records and clinical notes.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with LLM augmentation boosting sensitivity by 8.6% and 10.4%.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, interpretable tool for early pain forecasting, enhancing oncology care precision and resource allocation.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

TL;DR: CitySeeker benchmark evaluates VLMs' ability to handle implicit needs in urban navigation, revealing severe limitations (21.1% task completion) and proposing human-inspired strategies for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel at explicit instructions but struggle with interpreting implicit human needs (e.g., "I'm thirsty") in dynamic urban environments, creating a gap in embodied navigation capabilities.

Method: Developed CitySeeker benchmark with 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities and 7 goal-driven scenarios. Analyzed model failures and investigated strategies inspired by human cognition: Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR).

Result: Top VLMs achieve only 21.1% task completion. Key bottlenecks identified: error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall.

Conclusion: The analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence needed for "last-mile" navigation challenges, emphasizing iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

*Khurram Khalil,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TOGGLE integrates Signal Temporal Logic (STL) into LLM compression to reduce computational costs and model size while formally preserving linguistic properties, enabling edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require high computational resources, limiting edge deployment; existing compression techniques degrade linguistic properties without formal guarantees.

Method: Proposed TOGGLE framework uses STL to specify linguistic properties and STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to explore quantization and pruning configurations.

Result: Evaluation on four LLM architectures achieved up to 3.3x reduction in FLOPs and up to 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic constraints.

Conclusion: TOGGLE is the first formal method integration in LLM compression, enabling efficient and verifiable edge hardware deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

*Nenad Tomašev,Matija Franklin,Julian Jacobs,Sébastien Krier,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper argues for serious consideration of patchwork AGI emergence hypothesis where coordination among sub-AGI agents achieves general capabilities, proposing a framework for distributional AGI safety using virtual agentic sandbox economies with market mechanisms and oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety and alignment research focuses on safeguarding individual AI systems, assuming a monolithic AGI emergence, but neglects the patchwork AGI hypothesis where groups of sub-AGI agents coordinate. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use and coordination capabilities makes this an urgent safety issue.

Method: Propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that goes beyond individual agent evaluation and alignment. The framework involves designing and implementing virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms.

Result: The paper introduces a novel framework to address collective risks in patchwork AGI scenarios, centered on virtual agentic sandbox economies with market mechanisms, auditability, reputation management, and oversight to safeguard against coordination-related hazards.

Conclusion: The patchwork AGI hypothesis should be given serious consideration to inform safety and alignment efforts. The proposed distributional AGI safety framework offers a proactive approach to mitigate risks in scenarios where general capabilities emerge through agent coordination, emphasizing the need for urgent development of corresponding safeguards.

Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing responsible AI frameworks provide principles but lack enforceable engineering mechanisms for embedding societal values throughout the AI lifecycle.

Method: Development of the SRS framework using a constraint-based formulation with safety-envelopes and feedback mechanisms, applied through case studies in clinical decision support, autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems.

Result: SRS successfully bridges normative objectives with actionable engineering controls, enabling continuous monitoring and enforcement of values like fairness and autonomy.

Conclusion: SRS provides a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems by integrating ethics, control theory, and governance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Adversarial Reasoner (GAR) is an on-policy joint training framework that uses an LLM discriminator to evaluate reasoning slices, providing dense step-level rewards to improve LLM mathematical reasoning quality and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs with reasoning capabilities still make process errors like incorrect calculations and brittle logic, requiring better training methods to enhance reasoning robustness.

Method: Co-evolves an LLM reasoner and LLM discriminator through adversarial RL; uses a compute-efficient review schedule to partition reasoning chains into slices, with the discriminator evaluating each slice's soundness.

Result: Consistent gains on mathematical benchmarks: improved DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 on AIME24 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7.

Conclusion: GAR enhances LLM reasoning by providing dense, calibrated step-level rewards, improving credit assignment and sample efficiency, with flexible applications in teacher distillation and preference alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

*Wei Guan,Jian Cao,Jinyu Cai,Qiqi Cai,Jianqi Gao,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLOW is a unified framework that combines graph neural networks and LLMs to predict Agentic Workflow performance, addressing limitations in existing methods by capturing both topological dependencies and semantic logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AW performance prediction methods fail to simultaneously capture topological dependencies and deep semantic logic, limiting scalability due to costly execution-based evaluation.

Method: GLOW integrates GNNs for graph-structure modeling and a graph-oriented LLM for semantic feature extraction, using contrastive alignment to refine the latent space for distinguishing high-quality AWs.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench demonstrate GLOW's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

Conclusion: GLOW offers an effective solution for scalable AW performance prediction by unifying structural and semantic modeling, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

*Sveinung Myhre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiscoverDCP is a framework that uses symbolic regression with DCP rules to automatically generate globally convex models for system identification, avoiding complex convexity checks and enabling more flexible forms than traditional convex expressions like quadratics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for system identification often rely on fixed convex forms (e.g., quadratic functions), which can be restrictive and inaccurate. Post-hoc convexity verification for discovered models is computationally challenging, limiting practical use in safety-critical applications.

Method: The framework integrates symbolic regression with Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) rule sets. It enforces that all candidate model expressions generated during regression adhere to DCP composition rules, ensuring global convexity by construction without needing separate verification steps.

Result: DiscoverDCP produces convex surrogate models that are more relaxed and accurate than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions. The output expressions are interpretable, verifiable, and flexible, maintaining convexity while improving functional fit.

Conclusion: DiscoverDCP offers a novel, efficient way to perform system identification by guaranteeing convex models from the start. It is suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks, overcoming computational hurdles and enhancing model accuracy and flexibility compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

### [60] [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Ensemble Learning for S\&P 500 Directional Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15738)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis and Decision Transformer achieves 60.14% directional accuracy on S&P 500 prediction, significantly outperforming individual models and prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial market prediction is challenging due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency, with most models struggling to exceed 55-57% accuracy. The paper aims to overcome limitations of prior approaches through a novel hybrid framework.

Method: Combines quantum sentiment analysis (4-qubit variational quantum circuit), Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection with five different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression). Uses smart filtering to exclude weak predictors.

Result: Achieves 60.14% directional accuracy (3.10% improvement over individual models) on 2020-2023 S&P 500 data. Statistical significance confirmed via McNemar's test (p<0.05). Backtesting shows Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8.

Conclusion: The hybrid ensemble framework demonstrates superior performance, with architecture diversity being more important than dataset diversity. Quantum-enhanced sentiment analysis and strategic model selection provide meaningful improvements in financial market prediction accuracy with practical trading potential.

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

*Ruifeng Xu,Liang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) to optimize irrigation and nitrogen fertilization for crops, addressing complexity and delayed feedback issues, showing improved yield and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with optimizing water-nitrogen combinations due to high complexity and poor yield results, and have difficulty quantifying mild stress signals leading to imprecise dynamic regulation and low resource utilization.

Method: The NDRL method uses a parent agent to select macroscopic actions based on projected yield and a child agent that incorporates quantified stress factors (WSF, NSF) with a mixed probability distribution to optimize daily strategies. DSSAT was calibrated with field data to simulate interactions.

Result: Experimental results showed simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both years, irrigation water productivity by 5.6% and 5.1%, and nitrogen partial factor productivity by 6.3% and 1.0% compared to the best baseline.

Conclusion: The method advances cotton irrigation and fertilization, offering new solutions for complexity and precision in agricultural resource management and sustainable development.

Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

*Jeff Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHARe-KAN uses vector quantization and a hardware-aware compiler to compress KANs, reducing memory 88x while maintaining accuracy on vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs suffer from high memory demands due to learned basis functions, hindering deployment in memory-limited settings, and traditional pruning fails due to holographic information distribution.

Method: Propose SHARe-KAN with Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to reduce functional redundancy, and LUTHAM compiler for static memory planning and hardware optimization.

Result: Achieves 88x runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB to 12.91 MB) with baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC, and >90% L2 cache residency on NVIDIA Ampere, decoupling from DRAM constraints.

Conclusion: SHARe-KAN effectively overcomes KAN memory limitations, enabling efficient deployment without accuracy loss, leveraging compression and hardware-aware compilation.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

### [63] [Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback: Preference Optimization as a Sequential Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16626)
*Barna Pásztor,Thomas Kleine Buening,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLHF is a new preference optimization framework modeling alignment as a sequential game between Leader and Follower policies, enabling inference-time refinement and handling complex preferences better than RLHF or NLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RLHF (using scalar rewards) and NLHF (seeking simultaneous equilibrium) have limitations in capturing rich preference structures and enabling flexible refinement.

Method: SLHF decomposes preference optimization into a Follower refinement problem and a Leader optimization problem against an adversary in a sequential-move game setting.

Result: Experiments show SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and allows inference-time refinements transferable across model families without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SLHF offers advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences, providing a promising framework for preference-based alignment.

Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

### [64] [How Do Graph Signals Affect Recommendation: Unveiling the Mystery of Low and High-Frequency Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15744)
*Feng Liu,Hao Cang,Huanhuan Yuan,Jiaqing Fan,Yongjing Hao,Fuzhen Zhuang,Guanfeng Liu,Pengpeng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals that both low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equally important for recommendation systems using GNNs, challenging the common belief that only low-frequency signals matter. It proposes practical methods to optimize signal usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The role of different frequency signals (low vs. high) in graph neural networks for recommendation is unclear, despite recent emphasis on high-frequency components.

Method: The authors theoretically prove equivalence of low/high-frequency signals, propose a frequency signal scaler module for fine-tuning, and introduce a space flip method to enhance graph embeddings.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show that either frequency alone suffices for effective recommendations, validating the proposed methods.

Conclusion: Both low and high-frequency graph signals are functionally equivalent in recommendation tasks, and practical modules can optimize their use in existing GNN frameworks.

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

TL;DR: LLaDA2.0 is a family of large discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) converted from auto-regressive models, featuring efficient knowledge inheritance and a 3-phase training scheme, with two open-sourced variants optimized for practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a new paradigm for frontier-scale model deployment by converting pre-trained auto-regressive models into diffusion models instead of costly training from scratch, enabling knowledge inheritance and practical efficiency.

Method: A novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable), and reverting to compact-size block diffusion (decay), followed by post-training alignment with SFT and DPO.

Result: Creation of LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts variants that deliver superior performance and efficiency at frontier scale through parallel decoding.

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0 successfully demonstrates a viable pathway for scaling diffusion models efficiently while preserving knowledge from auto-regressive predecessors, with both models open-sourced to advance practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

### [66] [A Unified Generative-Predictive Framework for Deterministic Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15746)
*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Janus is a deep learning framework for inverse design of heterogeneous materials, combining generative and predictive models to enable fast, accurate, and physics-informed microstructural design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse design of material microstructures is ill-posed and computationally expensive due to high-dimensional design spaces and nonlinear physics, with existing generative models lacking efficient deterministic inversion.

Method: Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder with a separable predictive head called KHRONOS, learning a latent space that is isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction, promoting disentanglement.

Result: On MNIST, Janus achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification, and diverse inverse generation. For thermal conductivity-labeled microstructures, it achieves R²=0.98 prediction accuracy, sub-5% pixelwise reconstruction error, and inverse solutions within 1% relative property error.

Conclusion: Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure design at lower computational cost than optimization-based methods, with a unified latent space supporting smooth manifold traversal and interpretable inverse mapping.

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

### [67] [D3G: Diverse Demographic Data Generation Increases Zero-Shot Image Classification Accuracy within Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15747)
*Javon Hickmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes D3G, a training-free zero-shot method using CLIP and Stable Diffusion XL to improve image classification accuracy and reduce demographic bias by generating diverse demographic data at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image classification suffers from underfitting in low-capacity models and demographic bias when datasets are imbalanced, particularly harmful in zero-shot settings.

Method: Uses CLIP as base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL to generate diverse demographic data at inference without additional training.

Result: Demonstrates improved classification accuracy and reduced demographic bias by providing diverse demographic representations during inference.

Conclusion: D3G effectively addresses bias and performance issues in zero-shot image classification through inference-time demographic diversity.

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

### [68] [Surely Large Multimodal Models (Don't) Excel in Visual Species Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15748)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is enhanced by combining few-shot learning expert models with large multimodal models (LMMs) through a post-hoc correction method called POC, which improves accuracy without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Species-level annotation requires domain expertise, making few-shot learning necessary for VSR models. LMMs, despite strong general recognition, underperform in specialized VSR tasks, but can correct expert model errors.

Method: The paper introduces Post-hoc Correction (POC): prompt an LMM to re-rank top predictions from an FSL expert model using enriched prompts with softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples.

Result: POC outperforms prior FSL methods by +6.4% in accuracy across five VSR benchmarks, without extra training, validation, or manual intervention, and generalizes across different backbones and LMMs.

Conclusion: POC effectively leverages LMMs to enhance FSL expert models in VSR, achieving significant accuracy gains as a plug-and-play module, highlighting synergy between specialized and general models.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

### [69] [A Special Case of Quadratic Extrapolation Under the Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15749)
*Abiel Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a gap in understanding ReLU NTK extrapolation near the origin, revealing it exhibits quadratic behavior unlike linear extrapolation far from origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research analyzed linear extrapolation of ReLU MLPs under NTK regime for distant OOD points, but extrapolation behavior near the origin remained unexplored due to NTK's lack of translational invariance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of neural tangent kernel properties, particularly examining feature map characteristics (non-translational invariance but rotational invariance) to study extrapolation behavior.

Result: Discovery that ReLU NTK exhibits quadratic extrapolation for evaluation points close to the origin, contrasting with linear extrapolation observed for distant points.

Conclusion: Near-origin extrapolation represents a fundamentally different special case from distant extrapolation in ReLU NTK, with quadratic behavior establishing important theoretical bounds for understanding MLP generalization.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

*Zihao Wang,Wei Peng,Junming Zhang,Jian Li,Wenxin Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TAO-Net, a two-stage network for encrypted traffic classification that handles both known and unknown traffic types using hybrid OOD detection and LLM-based semantic classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encrypted traffic classification methods struggle with new Out-of-Distribution (OOD) applications, either failing to handle them or using overly simplistic 'Other' categorization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Hybrid OOD detection using transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis; 2) LLM-based semantic classification with prompt strategy for fine-grained OOD categorization.

Result: Achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1 on three datasets, significantly outperforming previous methods (44.73-86.30% macro-precision).

Conclusion: TAO-Net effectively handles emerging encrypted traffic applications through adaptive OOD classification, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in interpreting complex datasets with high dimensionality and variable collinearity, aiming to improve interpretability and parsimony beyond traditional correlation analyses.

Method: Developing two color-coded visualization tools: Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) for nonlinear associations between variable pairs, and Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN) for nonlinear feature-ranking relative to a target.

Result: PKAN and MKAN provide more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information, capturing relationship strength and functional forms effectively.

Conclusion: The KAN-based tools enhance interpretability, support model workflow stages, and aid in discovering hidden patterns, promoting domain-informed model development.

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

TL;DR: ReactorFold reformulates nuclear fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models, enabling generative discovery of novel topologies beyond fixed human-defined constraints, such as asymmetric configurations and emergent inventory adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for designing nuclear reactor cores search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting the discovery of fundamentally new design topologies.

Method: The framework uses Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train a language model on pressurized-water-reactor assemblies, generating candidate layouts in a single forward pass.

Result: The DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion, autonomously adjusting gadolinium rod inventory to meet power-peaking constraints and discovering high-performing asymmetric configurations, despite training on fixed configurations.

Conclusion: Language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods.

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

Method: TMvRKM integrates kernel machines with multi-view learning via a regularized least squares approach, early/late fusion strategies, and a coupling term to balance errors across views.

Result: Outperforms baseline models on UCI, KEEL, and AwA datasets, with statistical analyses confirming superior generalization performance.

Conclusion: TMvRKM effectively addresses computational and generalization limitations of traditional multi-view kernel methods, demonstrating robust performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

*Jahidul Arafat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA) improves federated learning under non-IID data by incorporating domain knowledge constraints, achieving faster convergence, reduced heterogeneity, better privacy-utility tradeoffs, and validated on manufacturing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data due to ignoring semantic validity in client updates, requiring a theoretically-grounded approach to incorporate domain knowledge.

Method: Introduces SCFA, a framework that integrates domain knowledge constraints (e.g., from ontologies like ISA-95) into distributed optimization, with theoretical analysis of convergence and privacy.

Result: SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho), reduces data heterogeneity by 41%, improves privacy-utility tradeoffs by factor 2.7x, and shows 22% faster convergence and 41.3% model divergence reduction in experiments on Bosch data.

Conclusion: SCFA effectively addresses non-IID challenges in federated learning through semantic constraints, matching theoretical predictions with empirical results and enabling practical applications like predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework for discovering compact physical laws that reveal dimensional invariance, making experimental data analysis more interpretable and robust.

Method: Transforms experimental measurements into dimensionless groups using neural networks with regularization that encourages simple, interpretable coefficients like integers.

Result: The method successfully identifies dimensionless numbers, handles noise and sampling issues, and works for cases with single or multiple groups, though computational challenges remain.

Conclusion: Dimensionless learning is a promising approach for deriving physically meaningful laws from data, but requires further development in automation, computational efficiency, and usability.

Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable machine learning framework for thrombosis risk assessment in blood pumps using CFD-derived flow features, providing efficient and transparent predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational models fail to reliably predict thrombosis risk due to incomplete understanding of flow feature contributions.

Method: Logistic regression with structured feature-selection pipeline trained on spatial risk patterns from validated thrombosis model.

Result: Model accurately reproduces risk distributions and identifies thrombosis-prone regions even when applied to different pump types.

Conclusion: Framework successfully links flow features to thrombosis risk with high computational efficiency and transparency, enabling rapid thrombogenicity screening.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

TL;DR: CSA-TTA is a novel framework that enhances intraoperative hypotension prediction by incorporating cross-sample data from other patients during test-time adaptation, overcoming rare event limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative hypotension prediction is challenging due to patient-specific variability, and existing test-time adaptation methods struggle with unreliable training due to rare hypotension events.

Method: Constructs cross-sample bank with historical data, uses coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy (K-Shape clustering + semantic similarity), and integrates masked reconstruction and sequence forecasting signals during training.

Result: Improves Recall by +1.33% and F1 by +1.13% under fine-tuning, and +7.46% Recall and +5.07% F1 in zero-shot scenarios on VitalDB dataset.

Conclusion: CSA-TTA demonstrates strong robustness and generalization for personalized hypotension prediction by effectively leveraging cross-patient data during test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

### [79] [AdaGradSelect: An adaptive gradient-guided layer selection method for efficient fine-tuning of SLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15764)
*Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta,Manisha Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGradSelect is a new PEFT method that adaptively selects which transformer blocks to fine-tune based on gradient norms, achieving near-full fine-tuning performance with 12% faster training and 35% less GPU memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of LLMs is expensive and memory-intensive, while existing PEFT methods like LoRA can underperform by restricting updates to a limited subspace. For SLMs, where efficiency is crucial, a more adaptive and effective method is needed.

Method: AdaGradSelect selects transformer blocks for updating based on their gradient norms. It uses Dirichlet-based sampling (considering past update frequency) and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy, allowing exploration of different blocks early in training and focusing on the most important ones later.

Result: The method trains 12% faster and uses 35% less GPU memory while performing very close to full fine-tuning. On GSM8K, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3% on models like Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B, achieving similar accuracy on MATH.

Conclusion: AdaGradSelect offers a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods, particularly beneficial for SLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.
  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.
  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.
  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

*Mélissa Tamine,Otmane Sakhi,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies Shapley value computation for data valuation in LLMs, enabling scalable collaboration among data owners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data owners need methods to make informed investment decisions about data curation and to collaborate fairly when pooling resources for LLM training, but traditional Shapley value computation is computationally expensive.

Method: Leverages the specific mathematical structure of DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to enable scalable computation of Shapley values for data valuation.

Result: DPO dramatically reduces the computational cost of Shapley value computation, making it feasible for large LLMs without requiring numerous model retrainings.

Conclusion: This breakthrough unlocks practical applications at the intersection of data valuation and LLMs, facilitating fair resource pooling and informed data investment decisions.

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

### [81] [Bridging Data and Physics: A Graph Neural Network-Based Hybrid Twin Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15767)
*M. Gorpinich,B. Moya,S. Rodriguez,F. Meraghni,Y. Jaafra,A. Briot,M. Henner,R. Leon,F. Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid twin approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the gap between physics-based simulations and reality, requiring fewer sparse measurements while improving accuracy across different configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based models like FEM often have discrepancies from reality due to unmodeled effects, but purely data-driven approaches need large amounts of dense data which is impractical in real-world scenarios with sparse measurements.

Method: The method uses GNNs to represent the ignorance model, learning spatial patterns of missing physics from limited measurement locations, allowing data-driven corrections to enrich physics-based models without dense spatial, temporal, or parametric data.

Result: Evaluated on nonlinear heat transfer problems across various meshes, geometries, and load positions, the GNN-based hybrid twin successfully captures ignorance and generalizes corrections, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The GNN-enabled hybrid twin approach effectively bridges the gap between physics simulations and reality using sparse data, demonstrating practical applicability for complex physical phenomena with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

Motivation: Traditional PDE numerical methods struggle with high-dimensional/complex problems, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face accuracy and boundary condition handling limitations.

Method: Integrates natural gradient optimization with Euler/Heun time-stepping schemes, incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into loss function to enforce Dirichlet constraints precisely.

Result: Experiments on heat equation show Heun method's superior accuracy due to second-order corrections and Euler method's computational efficiency for simpler scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides foundation for extending framework to Neumann/mixed boundary conditions and broader PDE classes, advancing neural network-based solver applicability for real-world problems.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

TL;DR: TS-DP proposes a speculative decoding framework using an imitation drafter and RL scheduler to accelerate Diffusion Policy inference by 4.17x while maintaining performance in dynamic embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policy has high latency due to iterative denoising, and static acceleration methods fail in dynamic embodied environments where task difficulty varies over time.

Method: Distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model's denoising and use an RL-based scheduler to dynamically adjust speculative parameters based on task difficulty.

Result: TS-DP achieves up to 4.17x faster inference with over 94% draft acceptance, reaching 25 Hz frequency without performance loss in diverse embodied environments.

Conclusion: TS-DP enables real-time diffusion-based control through temporal-aware speculative decoding, effectively balancing efficiency and accuracy in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

TL;DR: This study evaluates nine kernel functions for t-SNE in biological sequence analysis, finding cosine similarity kernel superior to Gaussian and isolation kernels in both visualization quality and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional t-SNE uses Gaussian kernel which lacks data-dependence and has computational limitations for categorical biological sequences, while existing alternatives like isolation kernel may not optimally capture sequence similarities.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of nine kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences using three embedding methods (One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers), assessed through visualization and objective metrics including neighborhood preservation scores.

Result: Cosine similarity kernel outperforms other kernels, achieving better runtime efficiency and superior preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space, validated through classification and clustering experiments across six biological datasets.

Conclusion: Kernel selection significantly impacts visualization quality and downstream analytical tasks, with cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it ideal for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

### [87] [A Unification of Discrete, Gaussian, and Simplicial Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15923)
*Nuria Alina Chandra,Yucen Lily Li,Alan N. Amin,Alex Ali,Joshua Rollins,Sebastian W. Ober,Aniruddh Raghu,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified theory connecting three discrete sequence diffusion methods (discrete space, Gaussian in Euclidean space, simplex diffusion) through the Wright-Fisher population genetics model, showing they're parameterizations of the same process with practical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different discrete sequence diffusion methods have incompatible algorithms, theories, and tradeoffs, making it hard for practitioners to choose or switch between them. Previous theories only connected them in special cases.

Method: Building a theory that unifies all three diffusion methods as parameterizations of the Wright-Fisher model, identifying simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as large-population limits, and leveraging genetics literature to stabilize simplicial diffusion.

Result: The unified theory formally connects model likelihoods and hyperparameters. Experiments show Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous models on DNA generation, and single models can perform diffusion in multiple domains competitively.

Conclusion: The Wright-Fisher framework successfully unifies discrete diffusion methods, enables stable simplicial diffusion, and allows training single models that work across domains, relieving practitioners from balancing trade-offs.

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

### [88] [DSO: Direct Steering Optimization for Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15926)
*Lucas Monteiro Paes,Nivedha Sivakumar,Yinong Oliver Wang,Masha Fedzechkina Donaldson,Luca Zappella,Nicholas Apostoloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Direct Steering Optimization (DSO), a reinforcement learning method to control bias in generative models during inference by optimizing activation steering for better fairness-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models exhibit demographic biases that affect real-world decisions, and current steering methods fail to achieve equitable outcomes across groups while allowing user control over bias-performance balance.

Method: DSO uses reinforcement learning to find optimal linear transformations of model activations, specifically designed to reduce bias while preserving overall capabilities through inference-time control.

Result: DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fairness and performance on both vision-language and language models, enabling practitioners to adjust bias mitigation levels during inference.

Conclusion: Direct optimization of steering strategies is more effective for bias intervention than heuristic-based approaches, demonstrating superior controllability and fairness in generative models.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

TL;DR: BarcodeMamba+ is a foundation model for fungal DNA barcode classification that uses a pretrain-finetune approach with hierarchical enhancements, achieving superior performance over existing methods on challenging fungal taxonomy benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fungal DNA barcode classification faces challenges due to sparse labeling and long-tailed taxa distributions where conventional supervised methods struggle with generalization and hierarchical data structure.

Method: BarcodeMamba+ uses a state-space model architecture with pretraining on partially labeled data followed by fine-tuning with hierarchical label smoothing, weighted loss functions, and multi-head output layers adapted from MycoAI.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods across all taxonomic levels on benchmarks with distribution shifts, with each component contributing significant performance gains.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective tool for biodiversity genomics and establishes a scalable training paradigm for taxonomic classification in data-sparse domains.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

TL;DR: Transformers can effectively use both labeled and unlabeled data for in-context learning, improving performance even with limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most theory on Transformer in-context learning focuses on supervised settings, but in practice they work well with sparse or no labels, suggesting unlabeled data provides important structure.

Method: Introduction and study of in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where Transformers leverage both small labeled sets and large unlabeled examples.

Result: Transformers learn robust, context-dependent representations from unlabeled data, enabling accurate predictions and significant performance gains in low-label scenarios.

Conclusion: This offers foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack interpretability and control, hindering transparency and reliability in AI systems.

Method: Uses  ℓ₁-regularized autoencoder for unsupervised sparse feature learning, Grad-FAM for validation, and weight-space interventions for editing.

Result: Enables precise, continuous modulation of features, derives α_crit for diagnostics, and works on ResNet-18 and ViT-B/16 models.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework for feature discovery and model editing, advancing transparent and controllable AI.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIE4ML is a comprehensive framework for automating optimized AI model deployment on AMD's Versal AIE-ML devices, achieving near-peak kernel performance and efficient full-model execution with entirely on-chip data movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIE kernel optimizations don't address full neural network execution across the 2D array, and manual optimization for AMD's AIE architecture is challenging due to VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management.

Method: Developed a framework that automatically converts AI models to optimized firmware using a structured parallelization method scaling across the 2D AIE fabric, novel graph placement/search algorithm for topology-optimized placements, and seamless integration with high-level tools like hls4ml/PyTorch.

Result: Achieved 98.6% efficiency in layer scaling benchmarks using 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) with entirely on-chip data movement, demonstrating GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints in real-world models.

Conclusion: AIE4ML provides a practical solution for ultra-low-latency AI inference on AMD's AIE-ML devices, making it suitable for applications like particle physics trigger systems.

Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

*Alexios Veskoukis,Dimitris Kalles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decision-tree studies often use predictors that fall under privacy-regulated categories like health data and biometrics, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how commonly decision-tree methods use predictors that are regulated by privacy laws, using published studies as a proxy for real-world data usage.

Method: Compiled a corpus of decision-tree studies, categorized each reported predictor into regulated data categories (e.g., health data, biometric identifiers), and linked categories to excerpts from EU and US privacy laws.

Result: Many predictors in decision-tree studies are regulated, with healthcare having the largest share; prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns were analyzed, showing clear differences across industries.

Conclusion: The findings support the adoption of privacy-preserving methods and governance checks in machine learning practices, extending beyond decision trees.

Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

*John Hateley,Sriram Narasimhan,Omid Abari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel RFID localization method for forest environments achieves GPS-level accuracy without needing prior known tag positions, using Gaussian Process modeling and weighted log-likelihood matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commodity RFID systems perform poorly in forested areas due to signal issues, and existing fingerprinting methods require tags at known locations beforehand, which is not always feasible.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process to model environments based solely on RF signal responses, then matches unknown RF signals to the closest model in a dictionary via a new weighted log-likelihood method.

Result: Achieves localization accuracy comparable to GPS using passive RFID, enabling tracking of dozens of wildfire assets simultaneously near mobile readers without prior known positions.

Conclusion: This approach provides a cost-effective, scalable solution for asset tracking in forests, outperforming traditional RFID methods and offering GPS-like accuracy at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes low-rank factorization of attention layers in LLMs, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional low-rank approximations use static ranks that lack flexibility across different input contexts, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses an RL agent to formulate rank selection as sequential policy optimization, with online matrix perturbation theory for incremental updates and lightweight Transformer policy network with batched SVD.

Result: Maintains equivalent accuracy to full-rank attention while significantly reducing FLOPs, especially for long sequences (L > 4096).

Conclusion: Bridges adaptive efficiency with theoretical rigor, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

### [96] [Provably Extracting the Features from a General Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15987)
*Allen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient algorithm for recovering features from superposition in complex machine learning models using Fourier space refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex models encode features in superposition (overcomplete regime) making them hard to recover; existing methods struggle with general settings.

Method: Query-based algorithm using noisy oracle access; iteratively refines search space in Fourier space to locate hidden feature directions.

Result: Successfully identifies all non-degenerate feature directions and reconstructs the function f under general conditions.

Conclusion: The approach handles arbitrary superpositions and response functions, advancing feature recovery beyond prior limitations.

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

Motivation: Solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs) is computationally expensive with traditional numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer fast approximations but suffer from degraded predictive power over long time horizons.

Method: (1) Introduce a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme. (2) Propose a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. Demonstration on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance ROMs for parameterized PDEs by improving long-term predictive accuracy, potentially reducing computational costs in physical science applications.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

TL;DR: FTBSC-KGML is a pretraining-fine-tuning framework that improves carbon cycle quantification by leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity across agricultural sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for agroecosystem carbon quantification underutilize transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity, limiting accuracy in variable regions.

Method: The framework uses a pretrained global model fine-tuned with site-specific parameters and data (remote-sensing GPP, climate, soil) to learn place-aware representations.

Result: FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and better explanatory power than global models, effectively capturing spatial variability.

Conclusion: The approach enhances local accuracy and interpretability in carbon cycle estimation, extending previous KGML frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

*Paul Seurin,Dean Price,Luis Nunez*

TL;DR: A unifying geometric design optimization approach combining surrogate models and reinforcement learning reduces Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) by over 57% for heat-pipe microreactors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heat-pipe microreactors are suitable for remote areas but suffer from high costs and lack of economic viability. Early-stage design iteration informed by comprehensive economic and physics analyses is needed to address this.

Method: Generate random samples to train surrogate models (Gaussian processes and multi-layer perceptrons), then deploy them in a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework to optimize LCOE under constraints like fuel lifetime and peak heat flux.

Result: Operation and maintenance costs and capital costs are primary LCOE contributors. The optimizer adjusts design parameters to minimize costs while meeting constraints, achieving over 57% LCOE reduction in both high and low axial reflector cost cases.

Conclusion: The optimization approach effectively reduces costs for microreactors. Future work will integrate fuel and heat-pipe performance with multi-objective optimization to better understand constraint-cost interactions.

Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

TL;DR: CauStream is a new framework that uses adaptive causal graphs for more interpretable and generalizable streamflow forecasting, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models neglect physical processes and use fixed causal graphs that don't adapt to data, limiting interpretability and generalization in streamflow forecasting.

Method: CauStream jointly learns a runoff causal graph for meteorological factors and a dynamic routing graph between stations, with established nonparametric identifiability conditions.

Result: The model consistently beats state-of-the-art methods across three U.S. river basins and forecasting horizons, with performance gaps increasing for longer forecasts.

Conclusion: CauStream provides interpretable causal insights aligned with domain knowledge and offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling applicable to various scientific domains.

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

*Shao-Ting Chiu,Aditya Nambiar,Ali Syed,Jonathan W. Siegel,Ulisses Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepOSets is a non-attention neural architecture that can perform in-context learning for PDE operators, approximating solutions without weight updates after training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that in-context learning (ICL) can emerge from non-autoregressive, non-attention architectures like DeepOSets for scientific machine learning applications.

Method: Modified DeepOSets architecture combining DeepSets and DeepONets, tested on Poisson and reaction-diffusion PDE boundary-value problems with example pairs in prompts.

Result: DeepOSets accurately predicts solutions for unseen PDEs using in-context examples, proving universal approximation capability for continuous operators.

Conclusion: DeepOSets is a universal in-context learner for PDE operators, showing ICL is not exclusive to transformer architectures.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

### [104] [Privacy Blur: Quantifying Privacy and Utility for Image Data Release](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16086)
*Saeed Mahloujifar,Narine Kokhlikyan,Chuan Guo,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes privacy risks in image obfuscation methods, showing that Gaussian blur is reversible and less private than alternatives like pixelization or DP-Pix, which offer better privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image data often contains private information like faces and license plates, requiring obfuscation methods that hide this information while preserving utility for model-training. Standard Gaussian blurring is widely used but may not ensure privacy.

Method: The study evaluates four obfuscation algorithms: Gaussian blur, pixelization, DP-Pix (pixelization plus noise addition), and cropping. Privacy is assessed via reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility is measured by the quality of learned representations from models trained on obfuscated data.

Result: Gaussian blur is the least private method, susceptible to reversal attacks in low-precision implementations. Pixelization and DP-Pix, at appropriate granularity, provide better privacy and utility for computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: Practical implementations of Gaussian blur are reversible and insecure for privacy. Pixelization-based methods with proper parameters offer a superior privacy-utility balance, leading to the release of a software package called Privacy Blur.

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIMM is an AI framework that detects market manipulation risk by combining Reddit activity, bot indicators, and market data into a daily risk score for stocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market manipulation increasingly stems from coordinated social media campaigns, creating need for tools linking online narratives to market behavior for retail investors, regulators, and brokerages.

Method: Fuses Reddit activity, bot/coordination indicators, and OHLCV market data into daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score per ticker using parquet-native pipeline with Streamlit dashboard. Uses synthetic social features due to API restrictions.

Result: Created AIMM-GT dataset with 33 labeled ticker-days, showed discriminative capability with early warnings (flagged GME 22 days before Jan 2021 squeeze).

Conclusion: AIMM provides preliminary detection capability and early warning system for social media-driven manipulation, with released code/dataset supporting further research.

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes BUILD, a deterministic bottom-up algorithm for learning Directed Acyclic Graphs from precision matrices under linear Gaussian SEMs with equal noise variances, showing competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning DAG structure from observational data is crucial for causal discovery and machine learning, but existing methods may lack robustness or scalability.

Method: Exploits structure in the precision matrix to identify leaf nodes and parents stepwise, then prunes leaves. Periodically re-estimates precision matrix from finite data to mitigate error accumulation.

Result: BUILD exactly reconstructs DAG from true precision matrix. Experiments show it compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: BUILD provides an efficient and robust alternative for DAG learning with explicit control over complexity, suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals privacy risks in retained data during machine unlearning, introducing DVIA attack that exploits dual-model queries to amplify privacy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine unlearning protects unlearned data but creates unexplored privacy risks for retained data when adversaries can query both original and unlearned models.

Method: Proposed DVIA (Dual-View Inference Attack) using black-box queries to both models with a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module, eliminating attack model training.

Result: Experiments confirm DVIA effectively extracts membership information from retained data across datasets/model architectures, demonstrating amplified privacy leakage.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities for retained data in dual-view settings, requiring new safeguards against inference attacks.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework using graph-based analysis of hand-drawn cube sketches combined with demographic and neuropsychological data for Alzheimer's disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease is challenging, and cube-copying tasks provide simple but informative assessments of visuospatial function impairment in AD patients.

Method: Convert cube drawings into graph representations capturing geometric and topological properties, process them with graph neural networks, and fuse with age, education, and NPT scores using a late-fusion model.

Result: Graph-based representations outperform pixel-based convolutional models, and multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors.

Conclusion: Graph-based analysis of cube copying provides an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening that aligns well with clinical observations.

Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

TL;DR: stMFG introduces a novel multi-scale interactive fusion graph network with layer-wise cross-view attention and contrastive learning to improve spatial domain identification in transcriptomic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial transcriptomics methods process spatial and gene features separately with late fusion, limiting multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interactions.

Method: Proposes a graph network with layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution, combining cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

Conclusion: stMFG's interactive fusion approach effectively captures complex gene-spatial interactions, demonstrating significant performance gains in spatial domain identification.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel analysis of rank-based zeroth-order optimization algorithms establishing explicit non-asymptotic query complexity bounds for both convex and nonconvex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank-based ZO optimization is widely used but lacks rigorous theoretical analysis with explicit convergence rates, creating a gap between practical success and theoretical understanding.

Method: Analyzes a simple rank-based ZO algorithm using novel analysis techniques that avoid classical drift and information-geometric methods.

Result: Establishes explicit query complexity bounds:  Õ(dL/μ log(dL/μδ) log(1/ε)) for strongly convex functions and O(dL/ε log(1/ε)) for smooth nonconvex functions, both holding with high probability.

Conclusion: Provides the first explicit non-asymptotic convergence rates for rank-based ZO methods, offering new insights into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient optimization and bridging theory-practice gap.

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model is developed to rapidly predict geohazard runout (flow extent and deposit thickness) with high accuracy, outperforming numerical solvers in speed by 100–10,000 times, trained on extensive simulations and demonstrating generalization across flow types and terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting geohazard runout (e.g., landslides, avalanches) is crucial for risk reduction but challenging due to the trade-off between physical realism and computational speed in existing models.

Method: A machine learning model trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations using 10,000+ real-world digital elevation model chips, aiming to emulate physical behaviors like avulsion and deposition patterns.

Result: The model accurately predicts flow extent and deposit thickness, with computation speeds 100 to 10,000 times faster than numerical solvers, and generalizes effectively across diverse flow types and landscapes.

Conclusion: Neural emulation enables rapid, scalable runout prediction, offering significant potential for disaster risk reduction and large-scale early warning systems.

Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

TL;DR: Proposes CFC framework using LLMs for coarse-to-fine open-set classification on graphs, improving OOD detection by 10% and achieving 70% OOD classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all OOD samples as one class, but real applications like fraud detection need deeper OOD insights including probable labels without true label information.

Method: CFC framework: 1) coarse classifier with LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, 2) GNN-based fine classifier trained with identified OOD samples for better OOD detection and ID classification, 3) refined OOD classification via LLM prompts and post-processed labels using semantic OOD instances.

Result: CFC improves OOD detection by 10% over SOTA methods on graph/text domains and achieves up to 70% accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Conclusion: CFC effectively extends OOD detection to classification without true labels, leveraging LLMs for semantic OOD instances to enhance interpretability and practical utility in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAL is a novel federated graph learning algorithm that combines sharpness-aware optimization with correlation-based regularization to improve generalization and alleviate dimensional collapse in heterogeneous graph data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training of graph neural networks faces privacy concerns, while existing federated graph learning solutions struggle with data heterogeneity issues causing poor generalization and dimensional collapse in learned representations.

Method: The proposed SEAL algorithm simultaneously minimizes the loss function and its sharpness to find flat minima, and introduces a regularizer based on correlation matrices to relax representation correlations and prevent dimensional collapse.

Result: Experimental results on graph classification benchmarks show SEAL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated graph learning baselines and provides accuracy gains for more participants.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively enhances classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated settings by addressing both sharp minima and dimensional collapse problems.

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

TL;DR: A Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model is proposed to improve optimization of second-order latent factor models by incorporating sharpness via Hessian-vector products, showing superior performance on industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order latent factor (SLF) models are effective for high-dimensional incomplete data but suffer from difficult optimization due to their bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) can help find flat minima to improve generalization.

Method: The SSLF model uses two key ideas: acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products and injecting a sharpness term into the Hessian through designed Hessian-vector products.

Result: Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed SSLF model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating sharpness into second-order models via Hessian-based techniques effectively addresses optimization challenges, enhancing model performance and generalization.

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework called CKA Guided Modular Quantization is proposed, which automatically selects the best quantization algorithm for each layer of large language models using Linear CKA similarity, yielding better performance than uniform or existing mixed-precision methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training quantization methods use uniform strategies across all layers, ignoring that different layers may be algorithmically suited for different quantization approaches, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms per layer, uses Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to select the optimal quantization strategy for each layer, and integrates these into a hybrid quantized model without fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show the approach consistently outperforms uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods on LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen, in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: By customizing quantization per layer via CKA guidance, the framework achieves superior model compression and performance without fine-tuning, highlighting the importance of layer-wise algorithmic suitability in quantization.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

Motivation: Current unlearning techniques assume clean dataset separation, which is unrealistic in operational settings with highly entangled distributions. Perturbation-based methods often degrade model utility or fail to ensure safety when datasets overlap.

Method: Proposes Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), which uses a feature-aware activation-editing framework with structured misdirection vectors and activation importance maps to selectively suppress harmful representations.

Result: On WMDP benchmark, SRMU achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility loss, remaining effective under 20-30% dataset overlap where baselines collapse.

Conclusion: SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in LLM applications, addressing limitations of existing unlearning methods in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

### [119] [Multivariate Uncertainty Quantification with Tomographic Quantile Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16383)
*Takuya Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is crucial for safe AI. TQF is a method for multivariate uncertainty by modeling directional projections with a single nonparametric tree-based model, avoiding convexity restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariable targets, limiting reliable AI deployment.

Method: TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections using tree-based regression, aggregates quantiles across directions, and reconstructs the multivariate distribution via an efficient alternating scheme minimizing sliced Wasserstein distance.

Result: TQF is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets; source code is released on GitHub.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible, uncertainty-aware model that overcomes limitations of classical methods by handling all directions without convexity constraints.

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

### [120] [Quantitative Verification of Fairness in Tree Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16386)
*Zhenjiang Zhao,Takahisa Toda,Takashi Kitamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for quantifying fairness violations in tree ensembles that provides real-time upper/lower bounds, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fairness verification only gives single counterexamples, lacking important quantitative information about bias scope needed for effective mitigation.

Method: Leverages tree ensembles' discrete structure to create efficient quantification technique with anytime bounds, unlike model-agnostic CEGAR approaches that scale poorly.

Result: Experiments on 5 datasets show superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art fairness testing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed quantitative verification method successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches and provides practical tools for bias diagnosis in tree ensembles.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

*Dhruv Deshmukh,Saurabh Goyal,Nipun Kwatra,Ramachandran Ramjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kascade is a training-free sparse attention method that accelerates LLM inference by reusing top-k attention indices across layers, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention computation is the main bottleneck in long-context LLM inference, particularly for reasoning models and RAG applications, creating a need for efficient methods.

Method: Leverages intrinsic sparsity of post-softmax attention and stability of high-weight keys across layers. Uses anchor layers with exact Top-k computation and reuses indices in intermediate layers via dynamic programming optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 4.1x decode attention speedup and 2.2x prefill speedup over FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPUs while matching dense attention accuracy on LongBench and AIME-24 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Kascade provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating long-context LLM inference through layer-aware sparse attention reuse.

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

*Hao Tang,Jiongyu Zhu,Zimeng Feng,Hao Li,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GLNO, a neural operator framework using pole-residue decomposition and Laplace-Beltrami eigenbasis to handle aperiodic dynamics and irregular geometries, with a grid-invariant architecture (GLNONet) showing strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and irregular or non-Euclidean domains, limiting their applicability to real-world problems like PDEs on manifolds.

Method: Develop a generalized operator learning framework based on pole-residue decomposition with exponential basis functions. Introduce GLNO by embedding Laplace spectral representation into Laplace-Beltrami eigenbasis, and design GLNONet as a grid-invariant network architecture for practical implementation.

Result: Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed GLNO and GLNONet achieve robust performance, outperforming state-of-the-art models in handling aperiodic, decaying dynamics and arbitrary Riemannian manifolds.

Conclusion: The GLNO framework overcomes limitations of prior neural operators by enabling expressive modeling on non-periodic, irregular geometries, providing a powerful tool for operator learning with broad applicability across mathematical and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

### [123] [Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance: hierarchical MCMC sampling for Bayesian inverse problems combining multiple solvers through deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16430)
*Filippo Zacchei,Paolo Conti,Attilio Alberto Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme using neural networks to combine predictions from solvers of varying fidelity, avoiding expensive high-fidelity simulations during Bayesian inverse problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse UQ methods like MCMC are computationally infeasible with full-order models, while surrogate models face high data generation costs. Low-fidelity data is cheaper but less accurate.

Method: Multi-fidelity neural networks trained offline combine coarse solver outputs. During online phase, likelihood evaluations use coarse solvers and trained networks without high-fidelity simulations.

Result: Enables heterogeneous coarse solvers in hierarchy, improves approximation accuracy, achieves longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference.

Conclusion: Demonstrated effectiveness on groundwater flow and reaction-diffusion benchmarks with substantial computational savings.

Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

*Maeve Madigan,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Glenn Moynihan,Tom Kempton,David Sutton,Stuart Burrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-agent systems improve predictive performance but lack fairness evaluation methods, creating deployment risks in high-stakes domains like finance. The paper develops fairness evaluation methodologies and reveals emergent bias patterns through large-scale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lack of effective evaluation methodologies makes multi-agent systems unsafe for deployment in high-stakes domains like consumer finance, where biased decisions can cause regulatory breaches and financial loss.

Method: Develop fairness evaluation methodologies and conduct large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms.

Result: Reveals patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agents, showing multi-agent systems exhibit genuinely collective behaviors.

Conclusion: Fairness risks represent a significant component of model risk in financial applications. Multi-agent systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of components.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

*Roman Akramov,Artem Khamatullin,Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares automated methods for selecting optimal number of topics in LDA, showing learned optimizers like SABBO and PABBO outperform evolutionary ones in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of number of topics in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) impacts model fit and interpretability; there is need for efficient automated selection.

Method: Formulated topic number selection as discrete black-box optimization, compared Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolution Strategy (ES), Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO), and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO).

Result: All methods achieve similar final perplexity, but amortized optimizers (PABBO and SABBO) are more sample- and time-efficient; SABBO finds near-optimal topic number in one evaluation, PABBO in few, while GA and ES need full budget.

Conclusion: Learned amortized optimizers provide superior efficiency for automated topic number selection in LDA, enabling practical application with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) classifier to categorize Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and normal cells from microscopic blood images, achieving 98.88% accuracy on the ALL-IDB2 dataset and integrated into an IoMT framework for real-time communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual examination of blood and bone marrow smears for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) diagnosis is prone to human error and time-consuming, necessitating AI-based methods for accurate and efficient detection.

Method: The method combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) classifier to process microscopic blood images, classifying ALL and healthy cells, and is deployed within an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) structure.

Result: The model achieved an average accuracy of 98.88% in the test step on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2), enabling rapid leukemia identification.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework effectively automates leukemia diagnosis, reducing manual errors and time, and its integration into IoMT allows for quick, safe identification and real-time communication between patients and clinicians.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

*Pengfei Sun,Wenyu Jiang,Piew Yoong Chee,Paul Devos,Dick Botteldooren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a BN-free, fully integer quantized neural network using progressive layer-wise distillation that achieves competitive accuracy while enabling true integer-only inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantized neural networks still depend on batch normalization layers which prevent true integer-only deployment. Prior BN-removal methods often sacrifice stability and accuracy.

Method: Uses progressive layer-wise distillation: starts from pretrained BN-enabled teacher, trains student using layer-wise targets and Progressive compensation to eliminate BN while maintaining integer-only inference.

Result: On ImageNet with AlexNet, achieves competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantization without BN layers.

Conclusion: The method enables end-to-end integer-only inference suitable for resource-constrained edge and embedded devices, integrating directly with standard quantization workflows.

Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

*Daniël Bot,Leland McInnes,Jan Aerts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLSCAN is a novel density-based clustering algorithm that automatically identifies optimal cluster sizes by analyzing HDBSCAN* stability, showing improved clustering accuracy and competitive computational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density-based clustering algorithms require hyperparameter selection without prior data knowledge, making practical application challenging. DBSCAN needs density thresholds and HDBSCAN* requires minimum cluster size parameters.

Method: PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and persistent homology on a novel metric space to efficiently identify all minimum cluster sizes where HDBSCAN* produces stable leaf clusters.

Result: PLSCAN achieves higher average Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) than HDBSCAN* and shows less sensitivity to changes in mutual reachability neighbors. It demonstrates competitive run-times with k-Means in low dimensions and scales similarly to HDBSCAN* in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: PLSCAN provides an effective solution for parameter-free density-based clustering, offering improved stability and performance while maintaining computational efficiency across different dimensionalities.

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User purchase behavior modeling in display advertising faces challenges due to sparse positive events, class imbalance, and irregular timing, with existing methods overlooking temporal intent evolution and underutilizing event-counting statistics.

Method: Introduces Abacus, a self-supervised pretraining approach that predicts empirical frequency distributions of user events, combined with a hybrid objective integrating Abacus with sequential learning objectives.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods in accelerating convergence and achieving up to +6.1% AUC improvement.

Conclusion: Abacus effectively addresses sparsity and stochasticity in user behavior modeling by unifying aggregated statistics with sequence sensitivity, demonstrating superior performance in display advertising systems.

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MS-SHOT, a method addressing source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI by using momentum-guided soft pseudo-labeling to adapt models without source data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based RFFI models degrade when deployed across different receivers due to hardware-induced distribution shifts, necessitating adaptation without source data.

Method: Proposes Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), which uses momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and global structural constraints for adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness, handling label shifts and non-uniform class distributions.

Conclusion: MS-SHOT provides a practical, scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI adaptation, overcoming key limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

TL;DR: DataFlow is a unified LLM-driven framework for scalable, reproducible data preparation, featuring reusable operators and pipelines that boost LLM performance across math, code, and text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data pipelines for LLMs rely on ad-hoc scripts that lack principled abstractions, hindering reproducibility and limiting model-in-the-loop data generation.

Method: DataFlow introduces system-level abstractions and a PyTorch-style API for building modular dataflows, includes ~200 reusable operators and six domain pipelines, and integrates DataFlow-Agent to translate natural language into executable pipelines via operator synthesis and verification.

Result: Improves downstream LLM performance: +3% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7% average gains on code benchmarks, and 1-3 point improvements on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME; a 10K-sample dataset from DataFlow outperforms models trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data.

Conclusion: DataFlow offers a practical, high-performance foundation for reliable and scalable LLM data preparation, establishing a system-level basis for data-centric AI development.

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data. These results demonstrate that DataFlow provides a practical and high-performance substrate for reliable, reproducible, and scalable LLM data preparation, and establishes a system-level foundation for future data-centric AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text classification, such as gender classification from blogs, is a mature area with applications in market analysis and recommendation systems. Despite existing machine learning and deep learning approaches, there is a need to explore and compare neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy) methods to potentially enhance performance or combine symbolic reasoning with neural networks effectively.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

*John M. Statheros,Hairong Wang,Richard Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLARiTy is a vision transformer model for chest X-ray analysis that achieves competitive multi-label pathology classification and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization using class-specific tokens and SegmentCAM with anatomical priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray interpretation faces challenges in multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization, constrained by scarce region-level annotations.

Method: Uses multiple class-specific tokens for attention maps, SegmentCAM for foreground segmentation with anatomical priors, distillation from ConvNeXtV2, and is trained on NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset.

Result: Achieves competitive classification on 14 pathologies and SOTA weakly-supervised localization on 8 pathologies (50.7% improvement), with pronounced gains for small pathologies. Efficient variant works well in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: CLARiTy advances CNN-ViT hybrids by combining ViT self-attention for global context with convolutional background suppression for precise heatmaps, confirmed by ablation studies.

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

TL;DR: SPICE is a reproducible Python framework that reimplements three deep-learning-based Predictive Process Mining methods to enable fair comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PPM approaches lack reproducibility, transparency, and benchmarking capabilities, making comparisons difficult.

Method: Proposed SPICE framework reimplements three baseline deep-learning PPM methods in PyTorch with a common configurable base.

Result: Comparison with original metrics and fair evaluation on 11 datasets shows SPICE's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SPICE provides a robust foundation for reproducible and comparable PPM research.

Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

TL;DR: AI-based phishing detection system combining character-level CNN and LightGBM achieves 99.8% accuracy with real-time capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks continue evolving, requiring advanced detection methods to protect users from sophisticated threats.

Method: Ensemble approach using character-level CNN for sequential features and LightGBM with 36 engineered lexical, structural, and domain-based URL features.

Result: 99.819% accuracy, 100% precision, 99.635% recall, and 99.947% ROC-AUC on 19,873 URL test dataset; ensemble outperforms individual models (60% CNN, 40% LightGBM contribution).

Conclusion: The ensemble method effectively detects modern phishing techniques with minimal false positives, deployed via FastAPI for real-time detection.

Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

*Yuriy N. Bakhvalov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cascade architecture using polyharmonic spline packages to solve scalability and high-dimensional limitations of previous kernel-based regression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous analytical solution using polyharmonic splines had O(N^3) computational complexity and theoretical breakdown in high-dimensional spaces, limiting practical applications.

Method: Proposes a cascade architecture composed of polyharmonic spline packages, with efficient matrix procedures for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

Result: The cascade approach addresses scalability issues while maintaining theoretical justification for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Conclusion: The proposed cascade architecture provides a scalable and theoretically sound solution for kernel-based regression in high-dimensional spaces with unknown intrinsic dimensionality.

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

*Lei Wang,Xin Tan,Mingwei Wang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOSS is a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that introduces closed-loop, context-aware selectivity via Kalman gain, improving performance in sequence modeling and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selective SSMs like Mamba lack theoretical grounding and fail to support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics.

Method: KOSS formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization using a continuous-time update driven by Kalman gain, with global spectral differentiation for efficiency.

Result: KOSS achieves over 79% accuracy on a selective copying task, reduces MSE by 2.92-36.23% across forecasting benchmarks, and shows robustness in radar tracking applications.

Conclusion: KOSS provides theoretically grounded, context-aware selection, outperforming state-of-the-art models in accuracy and stability, with verified applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, NB) combined with hybrid feature extraction (textual + metadata analysis) effectively detect fraudulent Hajj/Umrah mobile apps, with SVM achieving 92.3% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfeit mobile apps for Hajj/Umrah services cause financial losses and privacy risks in Indonesia, necessitating automated verification systems.

Method: Used a dataset of official and unofficial apps; applied SVM, RF, and NB classifiers with hybrid features from TF-IDF (app descriptions) and metadata (permissions).

Result: SVM performed best with 92.3% accuracy, 91.5% precision, 92.0% F1-score; key discriminators were legality-related keywords and high-risk permissions.

Conclusion: The system offers a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in religious tourism and could serve as a national verification prototype.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

TL;DR: A minimal modification of GPT to unify with energy-based modeling (NRGPT), using inference as exploration on an energy landscape, with empirical verification and applications in language tasks and resistance to overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge GPT architectures with the energy-based modeling (EBM) paradigm by treating inference as a dynamical process on an energy landscape, aiming to unify these approaches.

Method: Propose eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), which modifies GPT to conceptualize inference as exploration of tokens on an energy landscape, with conditions where this becomes gradient descent.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on Shakespeare dataset, ListOPS tasks, and OpenWebText language modeling, with observation of resistance to overfitting during long training.

Conclusion: The NRGPT approach successfully integrates GPT with EBM, offering empirical support and potential benefits like overfitting resistance, though gradient descent conditions may not always yield optimal performance.

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric framework using vector field theory on discrete measure spaces to analyze spatio-temporal data from complex systems, proposing a two-parameter family of metrics that enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, and attractor characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics that challenge traditional analytical methods, especially with large spatio-temporal datasets. Advances in data collection create opportunities but existing techniques like dimensionality reduction struggle with data volume and complexity.

Method: The authors develop a geometric framework based on vector fields over discrete measure spaces, creating a two-parameter family of metrics applicable to time-dependent images, image gradients, and functions on graphs/simplicial complexes.

Result: Validation using biological and physical system simulations shows the metrics combined with multidimensional scaling successfully enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterization across flat and curved domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust analytical pathway for complex dynamical systems where traditional modeling is impractical but experimental data is abundant, effectively addressing key challenges in complex system analysis.

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEPIC is a system that improves memory efficiency in LLM applications by enabling better reuse of KV cache chunks across different positions and requests through page alignment and RoPE fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM applications waste memory by repeatedly processing the same content due to limitations in existing caching methods that cannot efficiently share KV cache chunks.

Method: Aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation to block-level, removes positional encodings via RoPE fusion in attention kernel.

Result: Reduces HBM usage by up to 2x over PIC and 5x for long prompts while maintaining latency and accuracy.

Conclusion: MEPIC effectively eliminates duplicate KV cache without model changes, significantly improving memory efficiency.

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

*Amit Jain,Richard Linares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRC is a neural architecture using deep iteration with a small network to enable efficient, near-optimal control for aerospace systems, reducing memory use vs. large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-performance neural control for embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, overcoming prohibitive scaling of parameter-heavy models like language models.

Method: Tiny Recursive Control (TRC) applies compact networks (approx. 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a hierarchical latent structure to refine control sequences via trajectory simulation and error correction.

Result: TRC achieves near-optimal control costs on nonlinear tasks with millisecond-scale GPU inference and below 10 MB memory, orders of magnitude smaller than baselines.

Conclusion: Recursive reasoning can scale control capacity through iteration depth rather than parameter count, effectively transferring from discrete to continuous synthesis while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

TL;DR: LaMer is a Meta-RL framework that improves LLM agents' exploration and adaptation abilities through cross-episode training and in-context policy adaptation, showing significant performance gains over RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-trained LLM agents struggle with active exploration and efficient adaptation from trial-and-error experiences in multi-turn tasks.

Method: LaMer uses cross-episode training to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization, plus in-context policy adaptation via reflection that allows policy updates without gradient computation.

Result: Experiments show 11%, 14%, and 19% performance improvements on Sokoban, MineSweeper, and Webshop respectively, with better generalization to challenging or unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

*Jiabin Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning, to automatically generate pseudo-labels for unseen data in Online Edge Machine Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online Edge ML enables continuous model training on edge devices, but faces the fundamental challenge of how to label truly future, unseen data points for model updates.

Method: KT acts as an oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model (which can be a pre-trained model) to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model on edge devices.

Result: Simulation experiments showed that when a stable teacher model is used, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance.

Conclusion: KT is beneficial when the teacher's task is generic (allowing use of pre-trained models) and/or when labels for the student's task are difficult/expensive to acquire, providing a practical solution for continuous learning in edge environments.

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

Result: Results show intelligent task sequencing substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance with traditional methods.

Conclusion: Task sequencing offers a valuable approach to mitigating forgetting and has applications in other areas like curriculum learning.

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

TL;DR: A federated learning approach using the Sherpa.ai platform successfully trained a model to classify collagen VI-related dystrophy images, achieving better performance (F1-score 0.82) than single-institution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning for rare disease diagnosis is limited by data scarcity and privacy concerns when sharing data across institutions.

Method: Used federated learning with the Sherpa.ai platform on collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures across two international organizations.

Result: The FL model classified images into three COL6-RD pathogenic mechanism groups with an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75).

Conclusion: Federated learning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and generalizability for rare diseases while maintaining data privacy, with potential applications in variant interpretation and sequencing strategy prioritization.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

### [148] [Impacts of Racial Bias in Historical Training Data for News AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16901)
*Rahul Bhargava,Malene Hornstrup Jespersen,Emily Boardman Ndulue,Vivica Dsouza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Examines biases in an AI classifier trained on news data, focusing on the 'blacks' label, revealing it acts as a racism detector but underperforms on modern issues, and warns against bias propagation in news AI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how AI models trained on historical news corpora, like the New York Times Annotated Corpus, encode outdated biases and stereotypes, and to assess the risks such embedded biases pose for real-world applications in computational journalism and newsroom settings.

Method: Creates a multi-label classifier from the New York Times Annotated Corpus and investigates the 'blacks' thematic topic label. Uses quantitative and qualitative analysis of the training corpus, applies explainable AI methods to decode the label's concepts, and tests performance on contemporary examples like COVID-19 anti-Asian hate stories and Black Lives Matter reporting.

Result: Finds that the 'blacks' label partially functions as a general racism detector for some minoritized groups, but performs poorly on modern examples, highlighting unexpected outputs and propagation of historical biases in AI models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the inadvertent encoding of historical biases in AI models trained on news data, posing risks for real-world journalistic applications like story discovery and summarization; calls for careful adoption of AI tools in newsrooms to mitigate bias reproduction while leveraging technological benefits.

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

### [149] [Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16911)
*Andrew Wagenmaker,Perry Dong,Raymond Tsao,Chelsea Finn,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Posterior Behavioral Cloning (PostBC) improves RL finetuning by modeling demonstrator's behavior distribution, outperforming standard behavioral cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pretraining with behavioral cloning may lack coverage of demonstrator actions, hindering RL finetuning; need for better initialization.

Method: Train policy to model posterior distribution of demonstrator behavior using supervised learning, instead of exact action matching.

Result: PostBC ensures coverage, maintains BC performance, and significantly boosts RL finetuning on robotic tasks.

Conclusion: PostBC provides a more effective pretraining method for RL finetuning, enhancing performance in robotics.

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

*Peter Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Ziniu Li,Wotao Yin,Xi Chen,Tianyi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper resolves the paradox in RLVR where both suppressing exploitation (via spurious rewards) and suppressing exploration (via entropy minimization) improve LLM reasoning, showing that clipping bias from spurious rewards reduces entropy to boost performance, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling dynamic in RLVR where discouraging both exploitation and exploration improves LLM reasoning performance, and to uncover the underlying principles reconciling spurious rewards and entropy minimization effects.

Method: The study investigates the relationship between policy entropy and performance, and examines whether spurious rewards yield gains through clipping bias and model contamination interplay, using analysis and a proposed reward-misalignment model.

Result: Clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs that improve reasoning, but entropy minimization alone is insufficient for gains; spurious rewards enhance performance beyond contaminated settings via the reward-misalignment model.

Conclusion: The findings clarify that spurious rewards benefit RLVR by reducing entropy through clipping bias, providing principles for more effective training, and resolving the paradox by showing that suppressed exploitation (via spurious rewards) indirectly enables better outcomes despite reduced exploration.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

*Shiduo Yang,Jiye Wang,Jiayu Qin,Jianbin Li,Yu Wang,Yuanhe Zhao,Kenan Guo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Ev-Trust is a game theory-based trust mechanism for LLM-driven multi-agent systems that uses dynamic feedback to promote cooperation while filtering out malicious behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open LLM-based multi-agent systems face increased risks of deception and misinformation, challenging trust and robustness.

Method: Integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic evolutionary game framework within a decentralized service interaction protocol.

Result: Proven stable equilibria via game theory; experiments show reduced malicious behavior and increased collective revenue.

Conclusion: Ev-Trust provides an evolutionary perspective for trust modeling in agentic service environments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.
