The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases.

We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top.

To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors.

Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget.

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data.

Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios.

We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|\u03c1|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation.

To appear in ICLR'26", "summary": "Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions.

Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLADA eliminates pixel transmission by using only class labels from a preloaded reference dataset, achieving <1MB payloads for task distribution while maintaining high accuracy.", "motivation": "Current dataset distribution faces massive communication costs when transmitting large payloads to diverse clients.
