### [1] [Emergence: Overcoming Privileged Information Bias in Asymmetric Embodied Agents via Active Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15776)
*Shaun Baek,Sam Liu,Joseph Ukpong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers identify Privileged Information Bias in LLM-driven embodied agents, where a knowledgeable Leader fails to effectively guide a sensor-limited Follower due to poor Theory of Mind. They propose an Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework showing a 50% "Success Gap" due to communication errors, finding Pull-based (querying) protocols significantly outperform Push-based instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with symbol grounding in embodied environments, especially when information is asymmetrically distributed. The paper investigates how Privileged Information Bias (Curse of Knowledge) prevents effective collaboration between agents with different perceptual capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR environment. They compare Push-based instruction (one-way communication) versus Pull-based protocol (active querying) between a Leader agent (full perception) and Follower agent (limited sensors).

Result: Experiments reveal a significant Success Gap: Leader perceives target successfully in 35.0% of episodes but team collaboration succeeds only 17.0% of the time. Pull-based protocol proves significantly more robust, with successful episodes featuring 2x more clarification requests than Push-based approach.

Conclusion: Active uncertainty reduction through query-based communication is essential for effective collaboration. Pull-based protocols dramatically improve grounding in asymmetric information settings, providing crucial insights for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

### [2] [Anubuddhi: A Multi-Agent AI System for Designing and Simulating Quantum Optics Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15736)
*S. K. Rithvik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Anubuddhi is a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts, eliminating the need for programming. It uses a three-tier toolbox, semantic retrieval, and physics simulation for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize computational experiment design in quantum optics for research and education, making it accessible to users without specialized programming knowledge.

Method: The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). It composes optical layouts via semantic retrieval from a component toolbox and refines designs through physics simulation.

Result: Evaluated on 13 experiments, the system achieved design-simulation alignment scores of 8-9/10. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, showing flexible mathematical representations are crucial for quantum optics diversity.

Conclusion: Anubuddhi successfully democratizes computational experiment design, producing strong initial designs that users can iteratively refine. A key insight is the distinction between structural correctness (high alignment confirms correct physics) and quantitative accuracy (requires expert review).

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

### [3] [AMUSE: Audio-Visual Benchmark and Alignment Framework for Agentic Multi-Speaker Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16250)
*Sanjoy Chowdhury,Karren D. Yang,Xudong Liu,Fartash Faghri,Pavan Kumar Anasosalu Vasu,Oncel Tuzel,Dinesh Manocha,Chun-Liang Li,Raviteja Vemulapalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMUSE benchmark reveals MLLMs struggle with multi-speaker reasoning; RAFT framework improves accuracy by 39.52% through agentic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs fail in agentic, dialogue-heavy multimodal tasks requiring tracking speakers, roles, and events over time.

Method: Introduces AMUSE benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in agentic audio-visual tasks and RAFT framework combining reward optimization with self-evaluation for efficient alignment.

Result: Models show weak multi-speaker reasoning; RAFT achieves up to 39.52% relative improvement in accuracy on AMUSE.

Conclusion: AMUSE and RAFT offer a platform to advance agentic reasoning in multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

### [4] [The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740)
*Timothy Prescher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD)', a mathematical framework showing ethical responsibility scales with uncertainty, converting Action Duty to Repair Duty, applicable AI and other fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks struggle with decision-making under uncertainty, treated simplistically. The need for a formal, scalable model of moral responsibility.

Method: Develops PPD with equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], uses Monte Carlo simulations, applies framework to clinical ethics, law, economics, AI.

Result: Systems with a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) maintain stable duty allocations, reduce overconfident decisions, demonstrating cross-disciplinary validity.

Conclusion: PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to ethical responsibility, balancing epistemic confidence and contextual risk for stable systems, aiding auditable AI development.

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

### [5] [Prompt-to-Parts: Generative AI for Physical Assembly and Scalable Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15743)
*David Noever*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework for generating executable assembly instructions from natural language using discrete brick parts, bridging semantic intent to manufacturable output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous text-to-3D approaches lack geometric validity constraints and fail to support complex assembly instructions or physical prototyping requirements.

Method: Utilizes LDraw as text-rich intermediate representation with constrained brick vocabulary, guided LLMs for step-by-step construction sequences, and introduces Python library for programmatic generation.

Result: Successfully generated buildable prototypes for complex domains (satellites, aircraft, architecture) with over 3000 assembly parts, demonstrating scalability and fidelity.

Conclusion: The 'bag of bricks' method serves as a physical API that compiles functional requirements into material reality, opening new design possibilities for manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

### [6] [AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783)
*Kit Tempest-Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Epidemiology is a governance framework for advanced AI systems, using population-level surveillance of AI outputs to detect unreliable behavior without requiring model interpretability, enabling domain experts to oversee AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods like SHAP and mechanistic interpretability struggle with the complexity of deployed AI models, creating a need for a scalable approach to govern AI systems without relying on understanding internal model mechanics.

Method: The framework standardizes AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields (risk level, alignment score, accuracy score) as exposure variables, passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations to predict output failures through statistical associations.

Result: AI Epidemiology provides automatic audit trails, zero burden on experts, continuity across model updates and vendor switches, and reliability scores with semantic assessments to detect unreliable AI outputs before harm occurs, validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.

Conclusion: This approach democratizes AI oversight by allowing domain experts to govern advanced AI systems without machine learning expertise, offering a practical, scalable alternative to traditional interpretability methods for real-world deployment and safety.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

### [7] [Beyond Training: Enabling Self-Evolution of Agents with MOBIMEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15784)
*Zibin Liu,Cheng Zhang,Xi Zhao,Yunfei Feng,Bingyu Bai,Dahu Feng,Erhu Feng,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOBIMEM is a memory-centric agent system that enables iterative self-evolution for LLM agents in mobile environments without model retraining, using specialized memory primitives and OS-inspired services to improve personalization, task success rates, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric LLM agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment, requiring continuous retraining or fine-tuning, which incurs high computational costs and faces trade-offs between accuracy and inference efficiency.

Method: Proposes MOBIMEM with three memory primitives: Profile Memory using DisGraph for user preference alignment, Experience Memory with multi-level templates for task execution generalization, and Action Memory for fine-grained interaction storage. Integrates OS-inspired services like a scheduler, AgentRR mechanism, and context-aware exception handling.

Result: MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices, based on evaluation with AndroidWorld and top-50 apps.

Conclusion: MOBIMEM effectively decouples agent evolution from model weights, enabling efficient, self-evolving LLM agents with enhanced personalization, capability, and reduced latency, without the need for costly model retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

### [8] [State-Augmented Graphs for Circular Economy Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15824)
*Richard Fox,Rui Li,Gustav Jonsson,Farzaneh Goli,Miying Yang,Emel Aktas,Yongjing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel decision-making framework using a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning graph is proposed for circular economy triage, optimizing product disassembly or reuse decisions based on historical state, condition-aware utility, and operational constraints, demonstrated with EV batteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circular economy triage requires adaptive decisions balancing retained value against processing costs and labor constraints, but existing approaches lack a unified, optimal, and generalizable solver to handle product variability and complexities effectively.

Method: Develop a deterministic solver over a state-augmented DSP graph, encoding disassembly history into state to enforce the Markov property, enabling recursive evaluation. Integrate condition-aware utility from diagnostic health scores and operational constraints to decide between continuing disassembly or committing to CE options.

Result: The framework is applied to hierarchical triage of EV batteries, showing recursive component valuation accommodates varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers, providing optimal decisions in a worked example.

Conclusion: The unified formalism offers a tractable and generalizable foundation for optimizing circular economy triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts, enhancing sustainability and efficiency.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

### [9] [PediatricAnxietyBench: Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Under Parental Anxiety and Pressure in Pediatric Consultations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15894)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines LLM safety for pediatric advice under adversarial parental pressures using PediatricAnxietyBench benchmark. 70B model outperformed 8B model but all showed vulnerabilities, especially with urgency language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parents increasingly use LLMs for pediatric guidance, but safety under real-world adversarial pressures (like urgent language) is poorly understood, potentially leading to harmful advice.

Method: Created PediatricAnxietyBench (300 queries across 10 pediatric topics, half adversarial). Evaluated two Llama models (70B and 8B) using multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition.

Result: Mean safety score was 5.50/15. 70B model outperformed 8B (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with fewer critical failures. Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8%, with urgency causing largest drop. Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures and post-vaccination queries. Hedging correlated with safety, but emergency recognition was absent.

Conclusion: Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides reusable framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

### [10] [Darth Vecdor: An Open-Source System for Generating Knowledge Graphs Through Large Language Model Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15906)
*Jonathan A. Handler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Darth Vecdor (DV) is an open-source tool for extracting structured knowledge from LLMs into a SQL-based knowledge graph, addressing issues like cost, safety, and inconsistent responses, with a focus on healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate challenges like high costs, slow speeds, safety concerns, and low confidence when querying LLMs directly in high-volume operations, especially in healthcare, by pre-extracting knowledge into a queryable database.

Method: DV extracts knowledge from LLMs into a structured, terminology-mapped SQL database. It includes features to handle erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent responses, and supports multi-element outputs. It offers a browser-based GUI for ease of use and prompt engineering by non-technical users.

Result: DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software without warranties. It is available for use but requires users to assess risks and ensure safe and effective application, acknowledging potential bugs.

Conclusion: DV aims to improve healthcare by providing a structured knowledge base from LLMs, with an interface accessible to domain experts. Ongoing development and cautious usage are emphasized to leverage its benefits while managing risks.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.

### [11] [Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922)
*Jovan Pavlović,Miklós Krész,László Hajdu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper proposes a novel RAG framework using spreading activation on automatically constructed knowledge graphs to improve multi-step reasoning, achieving performance gains over iterative RAG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems struggle with multi-step evidence retrieval and treat all information equally, while GraphRAG depends on high-quality graphs that are expensive to maintain.

Method: Uses spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs.

Result: Achieves up to 39% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG when combined with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval, works well with small language models.

Conclusion: The framework enhances complex reasoning tasks, is easily integrable as a plug-and-play module, and is effective in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

*Polaris Jhandi,Owais Kazi,Shreyas Subramanian,Neel Sendas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small Language Models (SLMs) can effectively replace Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise workflows by achieving competitive performance with significantly lower computational costs through domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of LLMs makes them impractical for routine enterprise use, creating a need for more cost-efficient alternatives that maintain performance.

Method: Fine-tuning a facebook/opt-350m model using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Hugging Face TRL for tasks like document summarization and query answering.

Result: The fine-tuned SLM achieved a 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, substantially outperforming baseline models like ChatGPT-CoT (26.00%).

Conclusion: Thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can lower adoption barriers and enable cost-effective integration of generative AI into production systems.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

*Samuel J. Gershman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

*Defu Cao,Michael Gee,Jinbo Liu,Hengxuan Wang,Wei Yang,Rui Wang,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM as ensemble orchestrator for time series forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series foundation models show inconsistent performance and lack interpretability; LLMs can't forecast directly but could judge ensembles.

Method: Fine-tune LLM with SHAP-based faithfulness scores to interpret ensemble weights as causal statements, enabling multi-turn conversations for adaptive optimization.

Result: Significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on CRPS and MASE metrics across 23 datasets and 97 settings.

Conclusion: Repositioning LLM as intelligent ensemble judge with causal interpretability establishes new state-of-the-art in time series forecasting.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

### [15] [Do Large Language Models Know What They Don't Know? Kalshibench: A New Benchmark for Evaluating Epistemic Calibration via Prediction Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16030)
*Lukas Nel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Most LLMs are overconfident about predicting unknown future events, as shown on KalshiBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs can quantify uncertainty for genuinely unknown futures.

Method: Evaluation of 5 models on 300 prediction market questions with verifiable outcomes.

Result: Systematic overconfidence; only one model beats base rate prediction.

Conclusion: Scaling and reasoning don't ensure calibration; it's a separate skill needing development.

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated system using topic modeling and LLMs to discover and categorize AI policies in course syllabi and institutional websites, promoting responsible GenAI use in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of GenAI by students raises concerns about misinformation, critical thinking erosion, and unclear policies, necessitating a tool to systematize policy analysis.

Method: Combines unsupervised topic modeling to identify key policy themes with LLMs (like GPT-4.0) for classifying GenAI allowance levels and requirements from policy texts.

Result: Achieved 0.73 coherence score for topic discovery; GPT-4.0 classification showed precision 0.92-0.97 and recall 0.85-0.97 for eight topics.

Conclusion: The tool successfully enables structured policy information, supports safe and equitable GenAI use in education, and can integrate into platforms for student compliance.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

TL;DR: WeMusic-Agent is a training framework for LLM-based conversational music recommendation that intelligently balances internal knowledge with external tool usage, showing significant improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration in personalized music recommendation scenarios.

Method: Integrates knowledge internalization (via pretraining on 50B music corpus) and agentic boundary learning to teach when to use internal knowledge vs. external tools like music APIs.

Result: Created WeMusic-Agent-M1 model and a new benchmark; experiments show significant improvements over existing models in real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the balancing challenge and advances conversational music recommendation capabilities.

Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data pipelines require thousands of real API calls, lack multi-hop reasoning, and incur high costs, limiting practical deployment.

Method: ToolForge uses virtual tools and (question, golden context, answer) triples to generate scalable data, enhanced with multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection, validated by a Multi-Layer Validation Framework.

Result: An 8B parameter model trained on ToolForge data surpasses GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior cost-effectiveness and performance.

Conclusion: ToolForge offers an efficient, automated framework for producing high-fidelity tool-learning data, enabling smaller models to achieve state-of-the-art results without expensive API dependencies.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .

### [20] [Weighted K-Harmonic Means Clustering: Convergence Analysis and Applications to Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16185)
*Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weighted K-Harmonic Means (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized version of K-harmonic means that ensures numerical stability and enables soft assignments. It demonstrates wireless network applications with rigorous convergence guarantees and superior performance in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical clustering methods like K-means lack numerical stability and direct applicability to wireless networks where soft assignments and signal-strength-based associations are needed.

Method: Developed WKHM algorithm with inverse-distance weighting for soft assignments. Provided convergence analysis under deterministic (fixed initialization) and stochastic settings (Binomial Point Process initialization and mild decay conditions).

Result: WKHM achieves better tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines in simulations with diverse user distributions.

Conclusion: WKHM is a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks, with strong theoretical convergence guarantees and practical benefits.

Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.

*Jianming Liu,Ren Zhu,Jian Xu,Kun Ding,Xu-Yao Zhang,Gaofeng Meng,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDE-Agent is a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs and external tools to automate PDE solving from natural language descriptions, improving over traditional methods and previous PINN approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PDE solving methods require expert knowledge and lack full automation. PINNs and frameworks like DeepXDE still depend on manual setup. There is a need for a more autonomous solution that leverages LLMs and tool collaboration.

Method: PDE-Agent introduces a Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration (enabling dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms) and a Resource-Pool with tool-parameter separation for multi-tool collaboration (managing runtime artifacts and dependencies).

Result: Evaluations using PDE-Bench show that PDE-Agent has superior applicability and performance in complex, multi-step PDE solving tasks compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: The toolchain-augmented multi-agent paradigm advances automated scientific computing, with PDE-Agent demonstrating effective automation from natural language inputs.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: SPRITE is a framework that programmatically generates scalable, diverse, high-quality spatial reasoning data using simulators and LLMs, achieving better VLM performance than template-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have limited spatial understanding. Template datasets are rigid, while manual annotation is unscalable and imprecise.

Method: Reframe ground-truth generation as code generation: LLMs compile spatial questions into executable programs verified against simulator scene metadata.

Result: Created dataset with 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, 300k+ instruction-tuning pairs. Trained VLM shows significant gains on spatial benchmarks and outperforms equivalent-sized datasets.

Conclusion: Overcoming template diversity limitations is crucial for robust spatial intelligence. SPRITE code and dataset will be publicly released.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

*Aniruddha Roy,Jyoti Patel,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlignMerge is a geometry-aware framework for merging LLMs that preserves alignment by constraining the merge to respect safety geometry, improving alignment metrics without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard merging methods like weight soups or task vectors can preserve loss but quietly destroy model alignment, risking safety issues when merging fine-tuned checkpoints.

Method: Establishes an alignment subspace in a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, using an Alignment Quality Index (AQI) as a functional. Optimizes a loss combining geometric proximity, alignment preservation, and a soft budget.

Result: Across five model families, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity) while matching or exceeding expert performance on tasks like instruction-following and reasoning, with less drift and budget violations than baselines.

Conclusion: AlignMerge makes alignment preservation a primary goal in merging, offering a geometry-aware approach for safely composing future foundation models.

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces an agent-side approach using LLMs to handle temporal gaps in real-world tasks by predicting precise waiting times, reducing query overhead and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tasks involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a Temporal Gap. Existing environment-side solutions limit scalability or dilute context windows with redundant observations.

Method: Extends the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, using LLMs' semantic priors and In-Context Learning to predict precise waiting durations (time.sleep(t)) for synchronizing with asynchronous environments.

Result: Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster show agents can calibrate internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments, validated by the agent-side approach.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuadSentinel is a four-agent guardrail system that compiles natural language safety policies into machine-checkable rules, improving enforcement accuracy while reducing costs through hierarchical conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety approaches using deployer-written natural language policies are ambiguous and map poorly to machine-checkable rules, leading to unreliable runtime enforcement for LLM-based agents.

Method: Expresses safety policies as sequents and uses four specialized agents (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, referee) with an efficient top-k predicate updater for prioritized checking and hierarchical conflict resolution.

Result: On ST-WebAgentBench and AgentHarm benchmarks, QuadSentinel improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives, outperforming single-agent baselines like ShieldAgent.

Conclusion: The system provides effective safety control without modifying core agents, enabling near-term deployment with separately maintained, machine-checkable policies.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Errors accumulate quickly in long-horizon GUI workflows, and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, creating need for critic models to assess actions before execution. Lack of diverse GUI feedback data and public benchmarks hinders critic model development.

Method: Three core contributions: (1) scalable pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) two-stage training combining supervised fine-tuning and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization; (3) OS-Critic Bench benchmark for mobile, web, and desktop evaluation. Curated 310k critic samples.

Result: OS-Oracle-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, surpasses proprietary models in mobile domain. As pre-critic, improves performance of native GUI agents in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

Conclusion: OS-Oracle framework effectively addresses critical gaps in GUI critic models through comprehensive data, training, and evaluation methods, enabling more reliable step-level decision-making for real-world deployment of computer-using agents.

Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

TL;DR: ForenAgent is a multi-round interactive framework that combines MLLMs with low-level tools for more flexible image forgery detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFD methods fail to effectively combine low-level artifacts and high-level semantic knowledge due to their heterogeneous nature.

Method: Two-stage training (Cold Start + Reinforcement Fine-Tuning) with dynamic reasoning loops and FABench dataset creation.

Result: ForenAgent shows emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks.

Conclusion: Framework charts a promising route toward general-purpose image forgery detection.

Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.

TL;DR: A systematic framework unifies agent and tool adaptations in AI systems, categorizing them into distinct forms with practical guidance for strategy selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As agentic AI systems grow more complex, adaptation becomes crucial for improving performance, reliability, and generalization, requiring a unified framework to organize the expanding research.

Method: Decompose adaptations into agent (tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled) and tool (agent-agnostic and agent-supervised) categories, analyzing representative approaches in each.

Result: The framework clarifies design trade-offs, provides selection guidance, and reviews strengths/limitations of existing strategies.

Conclusion: Offers a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for building more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities.

### [29] [Design and Evaluation of Cost-Aware PoQ for Decentralized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16317)
*Arther Tian,Alex Ding,Frank Chen,Alan Wu,Aaron Chan,Bruce Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cost-aware Proof of Quality (PoQ) framework improves decentralized LLM inference by incorporating efficiency measurements into rewards, using quality-cost balanced evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification methods for decentralized LLM inference lack scalability and ignore heterogeneous computational costs across nodes.

Method: Introduces a cost-aware PoQ with ground truth F1, learned evaluators, and GPT judgments in a unified pipeline, using a linear reward function.

Result: Semantic textual similarity bi-encoder correlates better with quality scores; largest models are most efficient; cost-aware rewards favor high-quality, low-cost nodes.

Conclusion: Cost-aware PoQ offers a practical, economically sustainable foundation for decentralized LLM inference.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

### [30] [AI Needs Physics More Than Physics Needs AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16344)
*Peter Coveney,Roger Highfield*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI has limited real-world impact despite hype, with physics offering more to AI than vice versa. The paper proposes 'Big AI' combining theoretical rigor with ML flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between AI's promotional claims and its actual technical limitations in scientific applications, highlighting how physics can enhance AI rather than just AI transforming physics.

Method: Critical review of current AI architectures (LLMs, reasoning models, agentic AI) and their flaws, exploration of quantum AI and analogue computing opportunities, and development of a roadmap for 'Big AI'.

Result: Identifies key limitations of current AI (e.g., meaningless parameters, bias, lack of uncertainty quantification) and outlines a synthesis approach to overcome them.

Conclusion: A shift toward 'Big AI'—integrating physics-based theory with machine learning—is essential for meaningful progress, with physics poised to significantly advance AI capabilities.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.

TL;DR: PCIA is a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by human path construction behavior, tested on 66 benchmark problems and showing strong competitiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans construct paths by combining existing routes when closures occur and explore randomly for unknown destinations, inspiring a swarm-based optimization approach.

Method: Generates random population of particles (paths), mimics human path mixing and random exploration to find optimal routes toward destination.

Result: Tested on 53 mathematical and 13 constrained optimization problems, PCIA demonstrated high competitiveness against popular and recent metaheuristic algorithms.

Conclusion: PCIA effectively translates human path-building strategies into a competitive optimization algorithm with promising performance across diverse problem types.

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthesis planning frameworks lack mechanisms for human interaction, limiting chemists' ability to integrate insights.

Method: Uses large language models (LLMs) to propose retrosynthetic transformations, enabling expert intervention through natural language prompts.

Result: Achieves up to 95% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks, demonstrating flexibility to adapt to constraints.

Conclusion: Synthelite is envisioned as a useful tool and a step toward LLMs as central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

### [34] [StarCraft+: Benchmarking Multi-agent Algorithms in Adversary Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16444)
*Yadong Li,Tong Zhang,Bo Huang,Zhen Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Created SC2BA environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarking using adversary paradigms instead of fixed AI opponents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL benchmarks use fixed built-in AI opponents which lack diversity and limit algorithm evaluation.

Method: Developed StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA) with fairness considerations and APyMARL library with easy-to-use interfaces.

Result: Benchmarked classic MARL algorithms in dual-algorithm paired and multi-algorithm mixed adversary modes, revealing issues in algorithm effectiveness.

Conclusion: SC2BA provides a new benchmarking approach that could advance the MARL field, with code released publicly.

Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.

*Jiayang Yang,Chunhui Zhao,Martin Guay,Zhixing Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeSeries2Report (TS2R) is a prompting framework that converts battery operational time-series into structured reports, enabling LLMs to improve tasks like anomaly detection and prediction in energy storage systems without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for interpreting time-series data, but their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance is largely unexplored, creating a gap between low-level sensor signals and high-level insights.

Method: TS2R uses segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation to encode short-term temporal dynamics into natural language, converting raw battery time-series into semantically enriched reports for LLM prompting.

Result: Benchmarking on lab-scale and real-world datasets shows TS2R-based prompting outperforms vision-, embedding-, and text-based baselines in accuracy, robustness, and explainability for tasks like anomaly detection and state-of-charge prediction.

Conclusion: TS2R enables LLMs to achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency in BESS management without retraining, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

### [37] [cuPilot: A Strategy-Coordinated Multi-agent Framework for CUDA Kernel Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16465)
*Jinwu Chen,Qidie Wu,Bin Li,Lin Ma,Xin Si,Yang Hu,Shouyi Yin,Jun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: cuPilot is an LLM-based framework for automatic CUDA kernel optimization using strategy-coordinated multi-agent design, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA kernel optimization is difficult due to hardware-software co-design needs and proprietary libraries; current LLM-based methods underperform due to poor agent designs and evolution mismatches.

Method: Proposes cuPilot with strategy as semantic representation, including a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization.

Result: For 100 kernels, cuPilot achieves average 3.09x speedup over PyTorch; on GEMM tasks, it shows sophisticated optimizations and high hardware unit utilization.

Conclusion: cuPilot effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods, offering an open-source tool for high-performance kernel generation, demonstrated by substantial speed improvements.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

### [38] [Quantifying and Bridging the Fidelity Gap: A Decisive-Feature Approach to Comparing Synthetic and Real Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16468)
*Danial Safaei,Siddartha Khastgir,Mohsen Alirezaei,Jeroen Ploeg,Son Tong,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new metric for autonomous vehicle testing that measures whether simulation and real-world data trigger the same decision-making evidence in the system, going beyond visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual testing relies on visual fidelity, but this doesn't guarantee reliable transfer to real-world because the system might base decisions on different features in simulation versus reality.

Method: Introduced DFF using explainable-AI methods to identify and compare decisive features driving system decisions for matched real-synthetic data pairs, with counterfactual explanation-based estimators and a DFF-guided calibration scheme.

Result: Experiments on 2126 KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs showed DFF reveals discrepancies missed by conventional metrics, and DFF-guided calibration improves feature-level fidelity without harming output fidelity across different systems.

Conclusion: DFF provides a behavior-grounded measure for simulation fidelity that focuses on causal evidence parity, offering a more reliable approach for autonomous vehicle safety validation.

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical meta-algorithmic research faces challenges with computational expense, experimental design complexity, and scattered best practices across publications.

Method: Compilation and synthesis of existing practices from COSEAL community subfields, organized around the complete experimental cycle.

Result: Establishes current state-of-the-art practices as a comprehensive guideline for researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

Conclusion: Provides a unified reference for conducting valid and scalable empirical research in meta-algorithmics, benefiting both newcomers and experienced practitioners.

Abstract: Empirical research on meta-algorithmics, such as algorithm selection, configuration, and scheduling, often relies on extensive and thus computationally expensive experiments. With the large degree of freedom we have over our experimental setup and design comes a plethora of possible error sources that threaten the scalability and validity of our scientific insights. Best practices for meta-algorithmic research exist, but they are scattered between different publications and fields, and continue to evolve separately from each other. In this report, we collect good practices for empirical meta-algorithmic research across the subfields of the COSEAL community, encompassing the entire experimental cycle: from formulating research questions and selecting an experimental design, to executing ex- periments, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results impartially. It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative art systems have complex parameter spaces where aesthetically pleasing outputs are rare, requiring extensive manual trial-and-error that leaves many configurations undiscovered.

Method: Developed an interactive, modular framework with reinforcement learning inspiration, featuring interchangeable exploration agents (both human-in-the-loop and automated) and seamless p5.js integration.

Result: Implemented and evaluated multiple exploration strategies within the framework, demonstrating systematic parameter space exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: ParamExplorer successfully addresses the combinatorial explosion problem in generative art by providing structured exploration tools that reduce reliance on manual trial-and-error.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic benchmarking of LLMs and VLMs on different CPU tiers reveals computational scaling laws and shows quantum-inspired compression reduces energy usage by up to 62% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying local AI models on edge devices requires understanding CPU-only inference laws, which remain unexplored despite CPUs being dominant in consumer hardware.

Method: Benchmarked models on MacBook Pro M2 and Raspberry Pi 5 using continuous sampling of processor/memory usage with AUC integration to analyze scaling with text length and image resolution.

Result: Found two scaling laws: linear computational cost with token length for LLMs, and resolution knee for VLMs. Quantum-inspired compression reduced processor/memory usage by 71.9% and energy by 62%.

Conclusion: Provides systematic quantification of CPU-only scaling for edge AI, identifying model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective levers for sustainable inference.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

*Himanshu Gharat,Himanshi Agrawal,Gourab K. Patro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based AI agents with memory enable personalization but introduce systematic bias, demonstrated via recruitment simulations using safety-trained LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-enhanced personalization in LLM agents improves relevance and continuity but risks bias, which remains unexplored compared to general ML/LLM bias.

Method: Simulated a memory-enhanced personalized agent in recruitment scenarios to study bias introduction and amplification across operational stages.

Result: Experiments showed bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, even with safety-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Memory-enhanced LLM agents require additional protective measures or guardrails to mitigate bias risks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

*Yumeng Wang,Tianyu Fan,Lingrui Xu,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Needle in the Web," a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based search agents on fuzzy exploratory queries, showing current models perform poorly (often <35% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on complex reasoning but overlook fuzzy exploratory search, where queries are vague and multifaceted, requiring retrieval of relevant webpages rather than factual answers.

Method: Created a benchmark with 663 questions across 7 domains, using a methodology to generate queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims from web content.

Result: Benchmarked 3 leading LLMs and 3 agent-based search systems; most struggled, with below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excelled across domains or difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Needle in the Web poses a significant challenge, highlighting the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity in current search systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

*Jirui Yang,Hengqi Guo,Zhihui Lu,Yi Zhao,Yuansen Zhang,Shijing Hu,Qiang Duan,Yinggui Wang,Tao Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prefix Probing is an efficient black-box method for harmful content detection that uses prefix log-probability comparisons and caching to achieve low latency and cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face a trade-off between detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost in safety-sensitive applications, necessitating a more efficient detection method.

Method: The method compares conditional log-probabilities of 'agreement/execution' vs 'refusal/safety' prefixes using prefix caching. It employs an efficient prefix construction algorithm to automatically discover informative prefixes for better discrimination.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models with minimal computational cost and no additional model deployment.

Conclusion: Prefix Probing offers strong practicality and efficiency, providing an effective solution for harmful content detection without the overhead of traditional methods.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

*Sri Yash Tadimalla,Justin Cary,Gordon Hull,Jordan Register,Daniel Maxwell,David Pugalee,Tina Heafner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper advocates for systemic shift toward AI literacy emphasizing human agency, critical thinking, and ethical reasoning over just operational skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current educational frameworks fail to address the literacy gap created by AI adoption, focusing too much on functional skills rather than critical/ethical reasoning.

Method: Proposes AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks centered on human agency - empowering intentional, critical choices about AI use for all educational stakeholders.

Result: Framework enables educators and students to become agents in human-centric AI approaches, articulating intentions and understanding impacts of AI decisions.

Conclusion: True AI literacy requires teaching about agency itself, framing technology as a choice rather than inevitability, with deep commitment to critical thinking and epistemology.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

TL;DR: Automated thematic grouping of Indonesian hadith texts using Apriori algorithm identifies meaningful semantic relationships like prayer-worship associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing digitalization of Islamic texts requires automated thematic grouping of hadith to facilitate study and technology-based learning systems.

Method: Preprocessing (case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) followed by association rule mining using Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters on Indonesian Translation of Bukhari hadith.

Result: Meaningful association patterns identified including rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story relationships, revealing themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration.

Conclusion: Apriori algorithm effectively uncovers latent semantic relationships in unlabeled hadith texts, contributing to digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of single-agent vs multi-agent MLLMs for geometry problem solving shows multi-agent benefits open-source models more than proprietary ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether multi-agent design provides benefits over single-agent approaches for diagram-grounded geometry problem solving in MLLMs.

Method: Systematic comparison of single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math using both open-source and closed-source models.

Result: Multi-agent consistently improves performance for open-source models (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL gains up to +6.8 points), while Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode except for modest gains on newer We-Math dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-agent pipelines benefit open-source models and can assist proprietary systems on newer benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cyber Humanism in Education to enhance human agency in AI-driven learning, outlining three design pillars, integrating them into frameworks, and showcasing higher-education case studies with findings on benefits and tensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI is transforming education by automating knowledge processes, which raises concerns about loss of human agency, teacher de-professionalisation, and epistemic risks, necessitating a framework to reclaim human control in AI-enabled environments.

Method: Conceptualizes AI-learning as socio-technical infrastructures, introduces the Cyber Humanism framework with pillars: reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, and dialogic design, aligns with international competence frameworks, and presents higher-education case studies using prompt-based learning and a Conversational AI Educator certification.

Result: Case studies demonstrate that Cyber Humanism practices can strengthen epistemic agency, but also reveal tensions such as increased workload, equity issues, and governance challenges in AI-integrated education.

Conclusion: Cyber Humanism offers a viable approach for human-centred AI in education, emphasizing collaborative human-AI workflows while addressing practical and ethical tensions to shape future educational infrastructures.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.

TL;DR: Paper shows two computational limits - formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability - constrain algorithmic intelligence by preventing agents from computing their own maximal prediction horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental computational constraints that bound intelligent systems' reasoning and prediction capabilities, particularly regarding self-analysis.

Method: Formalizes two independent computational limitations (formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability) and analyzes their combined structural effects on algorithmic agents.

Result: Demonstrates that algorithmic agents cannot generally compute their own maximal prediction horizon due to the combined constraints of incompleteness and unpredictability.

Conclusion: Reveals inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems, establishing fundamental limits on algorithmic intelligence.

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box AI systems are increasingly used for sequential decision making, but their opacity poses safety risks. There is a need for efficient methods to provide sound and interpretable representations of these systems' capabilities.

Method: The approach uses Monte-Carlo tree search to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe capabilities, execution conditions, and probabilistic outcomes.

Result: Theoretical results demonstrate soundness, completeness, and convergence of learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems show the method's efficiency, accuracy, and broad applicability.

Conclusion: PDDL-style representations combined with Monte-Carlo tree search effectively model BBAI planning capabilities, providing interpretable and reliable representations for safe deployment.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High prevalence (91%) of breakthrough pain in lung cancer patients requiring timely intervention drives need for proactive pain management.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 266 inpatients using hybrid ML (temporal medication trends) and LLM (interpretation of dosing records and clinical notes) from structured/unstructured EHR data.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with 8.6-10.4% sensitivity improvement from LLM augmentation.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach provides clinically interpretable, scalable tool for early pain forecasting, enhancing treatment precision and resource allocation.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

TL;DR: CitySeeker benchmark evaluates VLMs' ability to handle implicit needs in urban navigation, showing current models achieve only 21.1% success due to reasoning and spatial cognition limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs excel at explicit navigation instructions but struggle with interpreting implicit human needs like "I am thirsty" in dynamic urban environments.

Method: Created CitySeeker benchmark with 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities covering 7 goal-driven scenarios to test VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making.

Result: Top models like Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct achieved only 21.1% task completion, revealing bottlenecks in long-horizon reasoning, spatial cognition, and memory recall.

Conclusion: Proposed BCR strategies (Backtracking, Enriching Spatial Cognition, Memory Retrieval) inspired by human cognition offer actionable insights for improving VLMs' spatial intelligence for last-mile navigation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

TL;DR: TOGGLE is a framework using Temporal Logic to compress LLMs while preserving linguistic properties, achieving up to 3.3x FLOPs reduction and 68.8% size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require high computational resources, limiting edge deployment; existing compression techniques degrade linguistic properties without formal guarantees.

Method: Uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to specify linguistic constraints, employs STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization for layer-wise quantization and pruning without retraining.

Result: Evaluated on GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B; satisfies all linguistic properties while reducing computational costs (up to 3.3x FLOPs) and model size (up to 68.8%).

Conclusion: TOGGLE is the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment on edge hardware.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

### [55] [Distributional AGI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16856)
*Nenad Tomašev,Matija Franklin,Julian Jacobs,Sébastien Krier,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for serious consideration of patchwork AGI hypothesis, where coordination among sub-AGI agents leads to general capabilities, and proposes a framework for distributional AGI safety using virtual sandbox economies with market governance, auditability, and oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety research focuses on individual AGI systems, neglecting the alternative hypothesis of patchwork AGI emergence through coordination of sub-AGI agents with complementary skills. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use and coordination capabilities makes this a pressing safety issue.

Method: Propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that shifts focus from individual agents to collective interactions. Design and implement virtual agentic sandbox economies, either impermeable or semi-permeable, with robust market mechanisms governing agent-to-agent transactions, combined with auditability, reputation management, and oversight.

Result: The framework aims to mitigate collective risks by regulating agent coordination in controlled economies, moving beyond traditional alignment of single AI systems to address emergent hazards from patchwork AGI scenarios.

Conclusion: The patchwork AGI hypothesis should be taken seriously to inform safety measures. A proactive approach involving distributional safeguards, such as virtual sandbox economies with market governance and oversight, is urgently needed to manage risks from coordinated AI agent groups as they advance in capabilities.

Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing responsible AI and governance efforts lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the AI system lifecycle, necessitating a practical framework.

Method: SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight using a constraint-based formulation.

Result: Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems demonstrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering controls.

Conclusion: SRS bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that co-evolves an LLM reasoner and discriminator to enhance mathematical reasoning by providing dense step-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities still make process errors like incorrect calculations and brittle logic, requiring improved reasoning quality.

Method: An on-policy joint training framework uses a compute-efficient review schedule to partition reasoning chains into slices, with a discriminator evaluating each slice's soundness and providing structured justifications. The reasoner and discriminator learn through complementary reward signals for consistency and error detection.

Result: On mathematical benchmarks, the method improves performance: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0) on AIME24, with gains over baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reasoning quality by producing dense, calibrated step-level rewards, improving credit assignment and sample efficiency, with a modular discriminator enabling flexible applications like teacher distillation and preference alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

*Wei Guan,Jian Cao,Jinyu Cai,Qiqi Cai,Jianqi Gao,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLOW is a framework combining GNNs and LLMs to predict Agentic Workflow performance, overcoming limitations of existing methods by capturing both topological and semantic aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AW performance prediction methods fail to capture topological dependencies and semantic logic simultaneously, creating a scalability bottleneck due to expensive execution-based evaluation.

Method: Proposes GLOW framework with a graph-oriented LLM (instruction-tuned on graph tasks) to extract topological-semantic features, fused with GNN structural representations, plus contrastive alignment for latent space refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

Conclusion: GLOW effectively addresses AW performance prediction limitations, offering a unified solution that leverages both structural and semantic understanding for better scalability.

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiscoverDCP integrates symbolic regression with DCP rules to discover globally convex models without post-hoc verification, offering flexible and interpretable forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional convex expressions like quadratics can be overly restrictive, and post-hoc convexity verification is computationally intractable, limiting the discovery of accurate and safe convex models.

Method: A data-driven framework combining symbolic regression with Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) rule sets enforces that candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules.

Result: The framework produces convex surrogates with more relaxed and accurate functional forms than fixed-parameter convex expressions, ensuring global convexity by construction.

Conclusion: DiscoverDCP enables interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization, advancing data-driven convex system identification.

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

Motivation: Financial market prediction is challenging with most models limited to 55-57% accuracy due to market noise and efficiency. The paper aims to overcome limitations of prior approaches through innovative ensemble methods.

Method: Hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis (4-qubit variational circuit), Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection. Uses diverse algorithms (LSTM, XGBoost, etc.) on same data with smart filtering of weak predictors.

Result: Achieves 60.14% directional accuracy on S&P 500 prediction, statistically significant improvement (p<0.05). Ensemble with top-7 models outperforms using all 35 models (60.14% vs 51.2%). Preliminary backtesting shows Sharpe ratio of 1.2 vs buy-and-hold's 0.8.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity in financial prediction, with quantum-enhanced sentiment analysis providing meaningful gains. The approach shows practical trading viability across diverse market conditions.

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

*Ruifeng Xu,Liang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method to improve cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization by using dual agents for better yield and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research struggles with optimizing water-nitrogen combinations due to high complexity and poor yield results, and difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals leading to delayed feedback and inefficient resource use.

Method: NDRL uses a parent agent to select macro irrigation/fertilization actions based on yield benefits, and a child agent with Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF) rewards to optimize daily strategies using mixed probability distribution. Validated with DSSAT simulations using 2023-2024 field data.

Result: Simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both years, irrigation water productivity by 5.6% (2023) and 5.1% (2024), and nitrogen partial factor productivity by 6.3% (2023) and 1.0% (2024) compared to best baseline.

Conclusion: NDRL advances cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, offering solutions for complexity and precision in agricultural resource management towards sustainable development.

Abstract: Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.

*Jeff Smith*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

*Barna Pásztor,Thomas Kleine Buening,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLHF introduces a sequential game framework for AI alignment where a Leader policy commits to actions and a Follower policy refines them, outperforming RLHF and NLHF in handling complex preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference optimization methods like RLHF (scalar rewards) and NLHF (simultaneous equilibrium) have limitations in capturing rich preference structures and enabling iterative refinement.

Method: Frames alignment as a sequential game with Leader and Follower policies; decomposes optimization into Follower refinement and Leader adversary optimization; enables inference-time iterative sampling.

Result: SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and shows transferable inference-time refinements without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SLHF provides superior consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences compared to RLHF/NLHF, making it a promising framework for complex alignment tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.

### [64] [How Do Graph Signals Affect Recommendation: Unveiling the Mystery of Low and High-Frequency Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15744)
*Feng Liu,Hao Cang,Huanhuan Yuan,Jiaqing Fan,Yongjing Hao,Fuzhen Zhuang,Guanfeng Liu,Pengpeng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that both low and high-frequency graph signals are equally important for recommendations, proposing adjustable filtering and embedding correction modules that work with any GNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite spectral GNNs' success in recommendations being attributed to low-pass filtering, recent findings suggest high-frequency signals also matter, but their exact roles remain unclear.

Method: A frequency signal scaler module to fine-tune graph signal filtering for user-item similarity smoothing, plus a space flip method to enhance graph embedding expressiveness.

Result: Both low and high-frequency signals alone can achieve effective recommendations; extensive experiments on four datasets confirm the proposed methods' superiority.

Conclusion: The equivalence of low and high-frequency signals in recommendations is proven, with practical modules introduced for flexible filtering and embedding correction, validated across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

TL;DR: LLaDA2.0 is a family of discrete diffusion large language models scaling up to 100B parameters through conversion from auto-regressive models, featuring efficient training and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment by converting pre-trained auto-regressive models into discrete diffusion models instead of costly training from scratch.

Method: Uses a 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable), and compact-size block diffusion (decay), followed by SFT and DPO alignment.

Result: Created LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts variants that deliver superior performance and efficiency with parallel decoding capabilities.

Conclusion: LLaDA2.0 successfully demonstrates efficient knowledge inheritance and deployment optimization for large-scale diffusion models, with both models being open-sourced.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Janus is a unified generative-predictive framework for inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures, coupling a deep encoder-decoder with a predictive head to enable fast, deterministic physics-informed inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse design of material microstructures is computationally expensive and ill-posed due to high-dimensional design spaces and nonlinear physics. Existing generative models lack intrinsic structure for stable deterministic inversion with physics-informed bias.

Method: Janus integrates a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a separable KHRONOS predictive head, learning a latent manifold that is isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction, inducing disentanglement.

Result: Achieves R²=0.98 forward prediction accuracy, <5% pixelwise reconstruction error, and inverse solutions within 1% relative error of target properties on thermal conductivity-labeled microstructures.

Conclusion: Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at lower computational cost than optimization-based approaches by unifying prediction and generation in a single latent space.

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

*Javon Hickmon*

TL;DR: D3G is a training-free method using CLIP and Stable Diffusion XL to improve zero-shot image classification accuracy and reduce demographic bias by generating diverse demographic data at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image classification models suffer from underfitting and demographic bias due to limited model capacity and unbalanced datasets, leading to harmful biases in zero-shot classification.

Method: Proposes D3G method that uses CLIP as base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL to generate diverse demographic representations for each class during inference without retraining.

Result: Generating diverse demographic data at inference time improves classification accuracy and reduces demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models.

Conclusion: D3G effectively addresses demographic bias and improves performance in zero-shot image classification by leveraging generative models to create balanced demographic representations.

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

### [68] [Surely Large Multimodal Models (Don't) Excel in Visual Species Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15748)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LMMs underperform FSL expert models in Visual Species Recognition (VSR) but can effectively correct their errors via post-hoc re-ranking, leading to a simple plug-and-play method (POC) that boosts accuracy by 6.4% without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training machine-learned models for VSR requires extensive annotated data, but species-level annotation is expertise-intensive, leading to limited labeled examples. This motivates few-shot learning (FSL) for expert models. Meanwhile, LMMs show strong general recognition performance, prompting investigation into their capability in specialized VSR tasks compared to FSL models.

Method: The proposed Post-hoc Correction (POC) method involves prompting an LMM to re-rank the top predictions from an FSL expert model. Enriched prompts include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples, without requiring additional training, validation, or manual intervention.

Result: POC outperforms prior FSL methods by +6.4% in accuracy across five challenging VSR benchmarks. It generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to enhance existing FSL approaches.

Conclusion: LMMs struggle with direct VSR tasks but excel at correcting FSL expert models' errors through post-hoc re-ranking. POC provides a simple, effective way to leverage LMMs' strengths to improve VSR accuracy significantly, demonstrating broad applicability and ease of integration.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

### [69] [A Special Case of Quadratic Extrapolation Under the Neural Tangent Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15749)
*Abiel Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLU MLPs extrapolate linearly for OOD points, but NTK analysis shows different extrapolation near origin where quadratic extrapolation occurs due to non-translation-invariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analysis focuses on linear extrapolation in general OOD cases, but NTK regime's extrapolation near origin remains unexplored due to non-translation-invariant feature maps creating distinct boundary cases.

Method: Theoretical analysis under neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, examining extrapolation behavior at extremes: far from origin (linear) vs near origin (quadratic) using properties of infinite-dimensional feature maps.

Result: Identification of quadratic extrapolation behavior for points close to origin in ReLU NTK, contrasting with linear extrapolation far from origin, due to rotational invariance and lack of translational invariance in NTK feature maps.

Conclusion: NTK analysis reveals two canonical extremes of ReLU extrapolation: linear far from origin and quadratic near origin, with the latter being a novel discovery enabled by understanding NTK's geometric properties.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that the ReLU MLP tends to extrapolate linearly for an out-of-distribution evaluation point. The machine learning literature provides ample analysis with respect to the mechanisms to which linearity is induced. However, the analysis of extrapolation at the origin under the NTK regime remains a more unexplored special case. In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAO-Net is a two-stage neural network for encrypted traffic classification that handles both In-Distribution and Out-of-Distribution traffic using OOD detection and LLM-based generation for fine-grained classification, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encrypted traffic classification faces challenges from new applications producing OOD patterns, as current methods rely on predefined categories or coarsely group unknown traffic into a single 'Other' category, limiting effectiveness.

Method: A two-stage design: Stage 1 uses a hybrid OOD detection mechanism with transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to distinguish ID and OOD traffic; Stage 2 employs large language models with a semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD classification into a generation task for fine-grained classification without predefined labels.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, exceeding previous methods that reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, especially in identifying emerging applications.

Conclusion: TAO-Net effectively addresses OOD challenges in encrypted traffic classification by combining adaptive detection and LLM-based generation, enabling accurate and fine-grained classification without predefined labels, as validated by superior performance metrics.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

Method: Developed Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) to characterize nonlinear variable associations and Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN) to rank feature contributions, using KANs for robust visualization.

Result: Experimental comparisons show PKAN and MKAN provide more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information, capturing relationship strength and functional forms.

Conclusion: The KAN-based tools enhance interpretability, support model development workflows, and facilitate discovery of hidden physical patterns, promoting domain-informed scientific analysis.

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reactor design methods are limited to fixed human-defined configuration spaces, preventing discovery of fundamentally new design topologies.

Method: Reformulates fuel-assembly design as sequence modeling, using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train language models.

Result: The DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion, autonomously adjusting gadolinium inventory and discovering high-performing asymmetric configurations despite training only on symmetric designs.

Conclusion: Language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional methods.

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view learning models face challenges in high-dimensional kernel spaces, including computational inefficiency from quadratic programming and difficulties with view inconsistencies in multi-view datasets.

Method: The TMvRKM model uses a regularized least squares approach instead of quadratic programming, with a primal objective containing a coupling term for error balancing across views, integrating both early and late fusion strategies.

Result: Experimental results on UCI, KEEL, and AwA datasets show TMvRKM consistently outperforms baseline models in all scenarios with exceptional generalization performance.

Conclusion: TMvRKM successfully addresses computational and generalization challenges of traditional multi-view kernel methods, providing an efficient and effective solution for multi-view classification tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 is growing quickly, which has changed smart production by encouraging the use of real-time tracking, machine learning, and AI-driven systems to make operations run more smoothly. The main focus of this dissertation is on creating and testing an intelligent production system for XRIT that solves important problems like energy management, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions. The testing shows that the system makes working efficiency, energy management, and the ability to plan repairs much better. Moving the system to real-time data merging and looking for other ways to make it better will be the main focus of future work.

TL;DR: SCFA incorporates domain constraints into federated learning to handle non-IID data, proving faster convergence and better privacy-utility tradeoffs with empirical validation on manufacturing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces slow convergence under non-IID data; current methods ignore semantic validity of client updates.

Method: Introduces Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a framework integrating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization, using knowledge graphs from ontologies.

Result: Theoretical convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho), 41% reduction in data heterogeneity, 2.7x privacy-utility improvement, 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction in experiments.

Conclusion: SCFA effectively mitigates non-IID challenges, with theoretical predictions matching empirical results, enabling practical federated learning with domain constraints.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tutorial introducing dimensionless learning - a machine learning framework that discovers dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental data by combining dimensional analysis with neural networks and interpretable regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic method for transforming experimental measurements into compact physical laws that reveal dimensional invariance, bridging classical dimensional analysis with modern ML techniques.

Method: Transforms measured physical quantities into dimensionless groups using dimensional analysis, then applies neural networks to discover optimal combinations. Uses regularization to encourage interpretable coefficients (integers/half-integers). Systematically evaluates noise and sampling effects.

Result: Method successfully identifies single/multiple dimensionless numbers, demonstrates robustness to experimental uncertainties, and shows equivalent representations capture same underlying physics.

Conclusion: Dimensionless learning effectively discovers interpretable scaling laws but faces challenges including computational costs for multiple groups, data characteristic influences, variable selection automation, and need for user-friendly tools for experimentalists.

Abstract: Dimensionless learning is a data-driven framework for discovering dimensionless numbers and scaling laws from experimental measurements. This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.

TL;DR: Interpretable ML framework using logistic regression and CFD features for spatial thrombosis risk prediction in blood pumps, trained on limited data but showing transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational models fail to reliably predict thrombosis risk in rotary blood pumps due to incomplete understanding of flow-thrombosis relationships.

Method: Logistic regression model with structured feature selection pipeline, trained on spatial risk patterns from validated thrombosis models for two scenarios.

Result: Model accurately reproduces risk distributions, identifies thrombosis-related flow features, and predicts risk regions in centrifugal pump despite axial pump training.

Conclusion: Interpretable ML efficiently links flow features to thrombosis risk, enabling rapid screening and complementing physics-based modeling for device design.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSA-TTA is a Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that improves intraoperative hypotension prediction by incorporating hypotension events from other patients through cross-sample retrieval and multi-task training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) prediction is challenging due to patient-specific variability and rare events. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is promising but suffers from unreliable training due to event rarity.

Method: Framework includes: 1) building a cross-sample bank from historical data; 2) coarse-to-fine retrieval using K-Shape clustering and semantic similarity; 3) multi-task training with masked reconstruction and sequence forecasting.

Result: Evaluation on VitalDB and real-world datasets shows improved performance. On VitalDB: +1.33% Recall and +1.13% F1 with fine-tuning; +7.46% Recall and +5.07% F1 in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: CSA-TTA effectively enhances IOH prediction robustness and generalization by leveraging cross-patient data and adaptive training signals.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

*Anshul Kumar,Gagan Raj Gupta,Manisha Chawla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGradSelect is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adaptively selects transformer blocks for updating based on gradient norms, achieving near full fine-tuning performance with significant resource savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PEFT methods like LoRA restrict training to limited subspaces, which can reduce performance, especially for Small Language Models where efficiency gains are crucial.

Method: The method uses Dirichlet-based sampling combined with epsilon-greedy exploration to select transformer blocks with highest gradient norms, balancing exploration in early training with focused updates later.

Result: AdaGradSelect achieves 12% faster training, 35% less GPU memory usage, and outperforms LoRA by 3% on GSM8K while maintaining similar accuracy on MATH dataset.

Conclusion: AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods for Small Language Models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform many NLP tasks well, but fully fine-tuning them is expensive and requires a lot of memory. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.
  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.
  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.
  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

*Mélissa Tamine,Otmane Sakhi,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents scalable Shapley value computation for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), addressing data valuation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data valuation is crucial for collaborative LLM training and investment decisions, but traditional Shapley value computation requires expensive retraining.

Method: Utilizes the mathematical structure of DPO to enable efficient Shapley value computation without prohibitive retraining overhead.

Result: Demonstrates that DPO simplifies computational challenges, making data valuation feasible for large language models.

Conclusion: The scalable approach unlocks applications in data valuation and collaborative LLM training.

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid twin approach combines physics-based models with data-driven GNNs to learn complex system ignorance using limited sparse spatial measurements, improving accuracy with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based models have discrepancies from reality (ignorance model), but purely data-driven approaches require large amounts of high-quality data unavailable in real scenarios.

Method: Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model, learning spatial patterns from sparse measurements to enrich physics-based models without dense data requirements.

Result: Evaluation on nonlinear heat transfer problems shows GNN successfully captures ignorance and generalizes corrections across different meshes, geometries, and load positions.

Conclusion: GNN-based hybrid twin improves simulation accuracy and interpretability while minimizing data requirements, overcoming limitations of sparse spatial measurements.

Abstract: Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.

TL;DR: Extends Time-Evolving Natural Gradient framework with Euler and Heun methods to enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions in PINNs, showing improved accuracy and stability on heat equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with accuracy and complex boundary conditions despite being efficient alternatives to traditional PDE solvers for high-dimensional problems.

Method: Integrates natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes (Euler, Heun) and adds boundary condition penalty terms to loss function.

Result: Heun method achieves superior accuracy due to second-order corrections; Euler method remains computationally efficient for simpler scenarios.

Conclusion: Foundation established for extending to Neumann/mixed boundary conditions and broader PDE classes, advancing neural network-based solver applicability.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-DP is reinforcement-based speculative decoding framework that accelerates Diffusion Policy inference by 4.17x while maintaining over 94% draft acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policy suffers from high latency due to iterative denoising; static acceleration methods fail in dynamic embodied environments where task difficulty varies over time.

Method: 1) Transformer-based drafter distills base model knowledge to replace expensive denoising calls 2) RL-based scheduler dynamically adjusts speculative parameters based on task difficulty.

Result: Achieves 4.17x faster inference, 94% draft acceptance rate, and 25Hz inference frequency across diverse embodied environments with no performance degradation.

Conclusion: TS-DP enables real-time diffusion-based control by providing adaptive, lossless acceleration through temporal-aware speculative decoding.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation shows cosine similarity kernel outperforms Gaussian and isolation kernels for t-SNE dimensionality reduction of biological sequences, providing superior runtime and analytical performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional t-SNE uses Gaussian kernel which has limitations for categorical biological sequences - lack of data-dependence and computational overhead. Recent isolation kernel alternative may not optimally capture sequence similarities.

Method: Evaluated 9 kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences using three embedding methods (One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, minimizers) with both subjective visualization and objective metrics including neighborhood preservation scores.

Result: Cosine similarity kernel generally outperformed other kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances. Validated through classification/clustering experiments across six biological datasets using multiple ML algorithms.

Conclusion: Kernel selection significantly impacts both visualization quality and downstream analysis, with cosine similarity kernel providing most robust performance across data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unifies discrete, Gaussian, and simplex diffusion models via the Wright-Fisher population genetics model, enabling stable training and flexible domain switching at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different discrete diffusion methods (discrete space, Gaussian Euclidean, simplex) have varying strengths (natural domain, better algorithms, theoretical benefits) and weaknesses (instability), lacking a unified framework for practitioners to leverage or switch between them.

Method: Establishes a theory linking all three diffusion methods as parameterizations of the same underlying Wright-Fisher model, identifying simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as large-population limits.

Result: Demonstrates stable Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion that outperforms previous simplicial models on conditional DNA generation, and trains models on multiple domains that are competitive with single-domain models.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for discrete diffusion, enabling practitioners to use a single model for diffusion across different domains at test time, with improved stability and performance.

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) is a reinforcement learning-based method for steering activations to reduce bias in generative models while controlling performance, offering better fairness-capability trade-offs than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models like VLMs can make biased decisions based on demographic attributes, and users need controllable bias reduction during inference without excessive performance loss; current steering methods are ineffective for achieving equiprobable outcomes across groups.

Method: Proposes DSO, which uses reinforcement learning to optimize linear transformations for steering activations, specifically tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining user control over model performance.

Result: DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fairness and capabilities on VLMs and LLMs, providing practitioners with inference-time control over the bias-performance balance.

Conclusion: Designing directly optimized steering strategies is beneficial for effective bias intervention, outperforming methods relying on pre-defined heuristics and enhancing controllability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BarcodeMamba+ is a foundation model for fungal DNA barcode classification, using a pretrain-finetune approach with hierarchical enhancements to outperform existing methods in data-sparse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fungal DNA barcode classification faces challenges due to sparse labeling, long-tailed taxa distributions, and hierarchical data nature, which conventional supervised methods struggle with.

Method: Uses a state-space model architecture with pretrain-finetune paradigm, integrating hierarchical label smoothing, weighted loss function, and multi-head output layer from MycoAI.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across all taxonomic levels on a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Provides an effective tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes a scalable training paradigm for taxonomic classification.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

TL;DR: Transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data alongside few labeled examples for in-context learning, improving performance in low-label scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory on Transformer in-context learning largely focuses on supervised settings with explicit labels, but in practice Transformers perform well even with sparse or absent labels, suggesting unlabeled contextual data contains valuable structure.

Method: Introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points.

Result: Transformers can leverage unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation, enabling accurate predictions and significantly improving performance in low-label regimes.

Conclusion: The findings provide foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the in-context learning framework.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

TL;DR: SALVE: A framework using sparse autoencoders to discover, validate, and control neural network features for interpretability and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack interpretability and controllability despite high performance.

Method: Uses  ℓ1-regularized autoencoder for unsupervised sparse feature discovery, Grad-FAM for validation, and weight-space interventions for control.

Result: Enables precise feature modulation, derives critical suppression threshold α_crit, and works on both ResNet-18 and ViT-B/16 models.

Conclusion: Provides a principled method for actionable model editing, advancing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIE4ML is the first framework that automatically converts AI models to optimized firmware for AMD's AIE-ML devices, achieving near-peak kernel performance and GPU-class throughput with microsecond latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine is challenging due to VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management, with prior work failing to optimize full neural networks across the 2D array.

Method: The framework includes a structured parallelization method scaling across the 2D AIE-ML fabric, a novel graph placement/search algorithm for topology-optimized placements, and seamless integration with quantized models from tools like hls4ml or PyTorch.

Result: Achieves up to 98.6% efficiency in layer scaling benchmarks, utilizes 97.4% of AIE tiles with entirely on-chip data movement, and delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints for real-world models.

Conclusion: AIE4ML enables practical ultra-low-latency AI inference, making it suitable for environments like particle physics trigger systems, with forward compatibility to newer AIE-MLv2 architecture.

Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.

### [93] [Governance by Evidence: Regulated Predictors in Decision-Tree Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15955)
*Alexios Veskoukis,Dimitris Kalles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decision-tree methods use predictors that often fall under privacy regulations. This study analyzes predictors from decision-tree papers against EU and US privacy laws, finding many regulated categories, especially in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-tree models rely on predictors that may be legally protected (e.g., health data, biometrics). Privacy laws are increasingly strict, but it's unclear how commonly used predictors align with these regulations. This study aims to bridge that gap by analyzing real-world predictor usage against legal frameworks.

Method: Compiled a corpus of decision-tree studies, categorized each reported predictor into regulated data types (health, biometrics, children's data, financial, location, government IDs), and linked categories to specific excerpts in EU and US privacy laws. Analyzed prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns.

Result: Many predictors in decision-tree studies fall into regulated categories, with healthcare having the largest share. Clear differences exist across industries. Prevalence and timing analysis showed alignment with privacy law reference years.

Conclusion: The findings support the need for privacy-preserving methods and governance checks in machine learning. This evidence can inform ML practice beyond decision trees to ensure compliance with evolving privacy regulations.

Abstract: Decision-tree methods are widely used on structured tabular data and are valued for interpretability across many sectors. However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees.

### [94] [Tracking Wildfire Assets with Commodity RFID and Gaussian Process Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15956)
*John Hateley,Sriram Narasimhan,Omid Abari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RFID localization using Gaussian Process modeling for forest environments without needing known tag positions, achieving GPS-comparable accuracy at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID systems struggle with tag localization in forests due to signal issues; existing methods require pre-tagged known locations, which isn't always feasible.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process to model environments based on RF signals alone, with a weighted log-likelihood method to match unknown tags to pre-modeled environments.

Result: Achieves localization accuracy similar to GPS using passive RFID, enabling tracking of multiple assets simultaneously without prior known positions.

Conclusion: This cost-effective, scalable approach enables reliable asset tracking in wildfire response without GPS or known tag locations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

*Caner Erden*

TL;DR: DR-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes low-rank factorization for MHSA in LLMs, reducing FLOPs while maintaining accuracy, especially for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional low-rank approximations are static and inflexible across inputs; DR-RL adapts to real-time sequence dynamics, layer sensitivities, and hardware for better efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: Uses an RL agent to select ranks sequentially, balancing attention fidelity and latency, with online matrix perturbation theory for incremental updates, lightweight Transformer policy network, and batched SVD operations.

Result: Experiments show DR-RL maintains accuracy equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing FLOPs, particularly effective for long sequences over 4096 tokens.

Conclusion: DR-RL bridges adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor for MHSA, offering a principled alternative to heuristic rank reduction in resource-constrained deep learning.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

### [96] [Provably Extracting the Features from a General Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15987)
*Allen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient algorithm for recovering hidden features from superposition in overcomplete regime using Fourier space search


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex ML models encode features in superposition, making them hard to recover, especially in overcomplete settings where features outnumber dimensions

Method: Iterative Fourier space search algorithm that refines search space to locate hidden directions from noisy oracle access

Result: Algorithm successfully recovers all non-degenerate feature directions and reconstructs the function in general superposition settings

Conclusion: The approach works for arbitrary superpositions and general response functions, significantly extending prior results

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

TL;DR: A new method combines flexible finite-difference with rollout loss training to improve reduced-order models' long-term PDE prediction accuracy, demonstrated on 2D Burgers equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduced-order models accelerate PDE solving but lose accuracy over long time horizons, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Introduces a high-order, inexpensive finite-difference scheme and a rollout loss function that trains ROMs for accurate predictions across arbitrary time periods.

Result: The approach maintains predictive accuracy over extended time horizons, as validated on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: The combined finite-difference and rollout loss method effectively enhances ROMs' long-term reliability for parameterized PDE families.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

TL;DR: FTBSC-KGML is a machine learning framework that combines pretraining-fine-tuning with knowledge guidance to improve carbon cycle quantification in agroecosystems by leveraging spatial variability and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate agroecosystem carbon quantification at relevant scales is crucial for climate mitigation, but current methods underutilize transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity due to heterogeneous data and cross-scale complexities.

Method: Proposes FTBSC-KGML, which augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process using remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil data. It includes a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme where a globally pretrained model is fine-tuned per site/state.

Result: Empirical results show FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and better explanatory power consistency than a global model, effectively capturing spatial variability across states.

Conclusion: The framework enhances local accuracy under limited data while maintaining interpretability, extending the prior SDSA-KGML approach for improved applicability in variable regions.

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel geometric design optimization approach using surrogate models (GPs and MLPs) within RL framework to minimize LCOE of heat-pipe microreactors, achieving >57% cost reduction while satisfying physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address financial viability challenges of heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs) in remote areas by integrating economic and physics analyses into early-stage design optimization.

Method: Generate random samples to train surrogate models (Gaussian processes and multi-layer perceptrons), deploy them in reinforcement learning optimization framework to minimize levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) under fuel lifetime, shutdown margin, heat flux, and peaking factor constraints.

Result: Optimizer reduces LCOE by >57% in both high-cost and low-cost axial reflector scenarios by strategically adjusting design parameters to minimize dominant costs (operation/maintenance, capital, reflector/drum materials) while satisfying constraints.

Conclusion: Integration of techno-economic considerations with physics constraints successfully improves HPMR viability, with ongoing work pursuing comprehensive fuel/heat-pipe performance integration with multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CauSTream: A causal spatiotemporal framework for streamflow forecasting that learns runoff and routing graphs, outperforming SOTA methods with better generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for streamflow forecasting lack interpretability and generalization due to ignoring physical processes, while existing causal methods use fixed causal graphs that don't adapt to data.

Method: Jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph between meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations, with established identifiability conditions.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across three U.S. river basins and forecasting horizons, with performance gaps increasing at longer windows, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Provides a principled causal spatiotemporal modeling foundation with interpretable graphs aligned with domain knowledge, extendable to various scientific and environmental applications.

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

TL;DR: DeepOSets: a non-attention-based architecture that performs in-context learning for PDE operator approximation, showing universality and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether in-context learning can emerge in non-autoregressive, non-attention architectures for scientific machine learning, specifically for solving PDEs from examples without weight updates.

Method: Introduces DeepOSets, combining set learning (DeepSets) and operator learning (DeepONets), modified for in-context learning of PDE solution operators from parameter-solution example pairs in a prompt.

Result: DeepOSets is shown to be a universal uniform approximator for continuous operators, capable of recovering solution operators of unseen PDEs from in-context examples, validated on Poisson and reaction-diffusion problems.

Conclusion: DeepOSets demonstrates in-context learning without attention mechanisms, providing a novel architecture for scientific machine learning with theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

*Saeed Mahloujifar,Narine Kokhlikyan,Chuan Guo,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study on privacy vulnerability of practical Gaussian blur for image obfuscation and comparison with alternatives like pixelization in terms of privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks in releasing images containing sensitive data (e.g., faces, license plates) while maintaining utility for AI training, as standard methods may inadequately protect privacy.

Method: Analyzed and compared four obfuscation algorithms: Gaussian blur, pixelization, DP-Pix (pixelization with noise), and cropping. Used reversal and discrimination attacks to evaluate privacy and trained models on obfuscated data to assess utility using representation quality.

Result: Gaussian blur implementation vulnerabilities allow reversal attacks, making it the least private. Pixelization and DP-Pix, with appropriate granularity, provide better privacy-utility balance for various tasks like face recognition and object detection.

Conclusion: Recommends using pixelization or DP-Pix over Gaussian blur for privacy-preserving image release and provides Privacy Blur software with parameter guidance for practical application.

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

*Sandeep Neela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIMM is an AI-driven framework that combines Reddit activity, coordination indicators, and market data to generate a daily risk score for detecting coordinated social media manipulation in financial markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market manipulation increasingly originates from coordinated social media campaigns, creating a need for tools to link online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior for retail investors, regulators, and brokerages.

Method: The system uses a pipeline with calibrated synthetic social features (due to Reddit API restrictions) and real historical market data (OHLCV), integrated into a Streamlit dashboard for analysis. It includes the AIMM-GT dataset (33 labeled ticker-days) and employs forward-walk evaluation.

Result: AIMM demonstrated preliminary discriminative capability and flagged GameStop (GME) 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak, providing early warnings. The labeled dataset is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events).

Conclusion: The release of AIMM's code, dataset schema, and dashboard design supports research on social media-driven market surveillance, offering a tool to detect manipulation risks despite current dataset limitations.

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

### [106] [BUILD with Precision: Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16111)
*Hamed Ajorlou,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Geert Leus,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes BUILD, a deterministic bottom-up algorithm for learning linear DAG structures from observational data by exploiting properties of the precision matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures from observational data is a fundamental problem in causal discovery and machine learning, but existing methods face challenges in robustness and complexity.

Method: BUILD algorithm identifies leaf nodes and their parents using the precision matrix structure, then prunes leaves iteratively. To handle finite data limitations, it periodically re-estimates the precision matrix during the process.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic benchmarks show BUILD performs competitively with state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms while providing explicit control over complexity.

Conclusion: BUILD offers an effective deterministic approach for DAG recovery with enhanced robustness through precision matrix re-estimation, making it suitable for practical applications in causal discovery.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

### [107] [Dual-View Inference Attack: Machine Unlearning Amplifies Privacy Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16126)
*Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Linqiang Qian,Peijin Guo,Yechao Zhang,Minghui Li,Yanjun Zhang,Dayong Ye,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper reveals that machine unlearning creates privacy risks for retained data when adversaries can query both original and unlearned models, proposing an attack called DVIA that exploits this vulnerability without requiring attack model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on privacy risks of unlearned data, but risks to retained data remain unexplored, especially in dual-view settings where attackers access both models.

Method: Introduces privacy knowledge gain concept and DVIA attack method using likelihood ratio inference on black-box queries to both original and unlearned models.

Result: Experiments show DVIA effectively extracts membership information from retained data across various datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning introduces amplified privacy risks for retained data in dual-view settings, requiring new protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

*Jaeho Yang,Kijung Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a graph-based multimodal framework using cube-copying drawings combined with demographic and neuropsychological data for Alzheimer's disease classification, showing superior performance over pixel-based methods and clinically interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease is challenging; cube-copying tasks provide simple visuospatial assessments but need better analytical methods.

Method: Converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph representations capturing geometry and topology, processes them with graph neural networks, and fuses with demographic/NPT features using late-fusion.

Result: Graph-based representations outperform pixel-based models; multimodal integration improves performance and robustness; SHAP analysis identifies graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors.

Conclusion: Graph-based analysis of cube copying is an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

Abstract: Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.

*Jianping Mei,Siqi Ai,Ye Yuan*

TL;DR: Proposes stMFG, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network using layer-wise cross-view attention and contrastive learning to improve spatial domain identification in transcriptomics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial transcriptomics methods process spatial and gene features separately and fuse them late, limiting multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction.

Method: Uses a graph network with layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution, combining cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

Conclusion: stMFG effectively enhances spatial domain identification by enabling richer multi-scale feature integration and maintaining spatial continuity.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables genome-wide expression analysis within native tissue context, yet identifying spatial domains remains challenging due to complex gene-spatial interactions. Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.

### [111] [Explicit and Non-asymptotic Query Complexities of Rank-Based Zeroth-order Algorithms on Smooth Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16200)
*Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first explicit non-asymptotic convergence rates for rank-based zeroth-order optimization algorithms, bridging a theoretical gap in understanding why these methods work efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank-based zeroth-order optimization methods are widely used (e.g., CMA-ES) due to robustness to noise, but existing theory offers only asymptotic insights without explicit convergence rates.

Method: The authors analyze a simple rank-based ZO algorithm, employing novel analysis techniques that avoid classical drift and information-geometric methods.

Result: For d-dimensional L-smooth μ-strongly convex functions, the algorithm achieves  Õ(dL/μ log(dL/(μδ)) log(1/ε)) query complexity to find an ε-suboptimal solution. For smooth nonconvex objectives, it reaches O(dL/ε log(1/ε)) complexity, both with probability ≥1-δ.

Conclusion: This work provides the first explicit non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for rank-based ZO optimization, offering new theoretical insights into why these heuristics are efficient in practice.

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

*Lorenzo Nava,Ye Chen,Maximillian Van Wyk de Vries*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model predicts geohazard runout (flow extent and deposit thickness) 100-10,000x faster than numerical solvers, demonstrating neural emulation's potential for scalable disaster risk reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geohazard runout prediction is crucial for protecting lives and infrastructure, but existing models face a trade-off between physical realism and computational speed.

Method: Train a machine learning model on 100,000+ numerical simulations across 10,000+ real-world terrain chips to predict runout.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy in predicting flow extent and thickness while reproducing key physical behaviors like avulsion, and generalizes across flow types and landscapes.

Conclusion: Neural emulation enables rapid, realistic runout prediction at scales relevant for early warning systems, offering new disaster risk reduction opportunities.

Abstract: Predicting geohazard runout is critical for protecting lives, infrastructure and ecosystems. Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CFC framework for open-set graph classification using LLMs to detect OOD samples and classify them into probable labels without ground truth, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods treat all OOD samples as single class, but real-world applications like fraud detection need finer OOD classification without true labels.

Method: Uses coarse classifier with LLM prompts for OOD detection and label generation, fine GNN classifier trained with identified OOD samples, and LLM-refined OOD classification.

Result: CFC improves OOD detection by 10% over SOTA methods on graph/text domains and achieves up to 70% accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Conclusion: CFC effectively extends OOD detection to classification using semantic OOD instances, enhancing interpretability and practical utility in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

*Ruiyu Li,Peige Zhao,Guangxia Li,Pengcheng Wu,Xingyu Gao,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sharpness-aware Federated Graph Learning (SEAL) addresses data heterogeneity in federated graph learning by optimizing both loss minimization and loss surface sharpness, while using a correlation regularizer to prevent dimensional collapse in representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated graph learning faces challenges with data heterogeneity across clients, causing poor generalization and dimensional collapse in local models when using standard empirical risk minimization.

Method: SEAL formulates a novel optimization objective that minimizes both the loss function and its sharpness to find flat minima, and introduces a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations to alleviate dimensional collapse.

Result: Experimental results on graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated graph learning baselines, improving classification accuracy and generalization for more participants.

Conclusion: SEAL effectively enhances the performance and generalization of GNN models in federated settings by addressing sharp minima and representation collapse, demonstrating superior results over existing methods.

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

TL;DR: A Sharpness-aware SLF model combining second-order latent factor optimization with sharpness-aware minimization to improve HDI data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLF models are effective but difficult to optimize due to bilinear non-convex nature; SAM shows promise for finding flat minima in non-convex optimization.

Method: Proposes SSLF model using Hessian-vector products to acquire second-order information and inject sharpness term into curvature through designed Hessian-vector products.

Result: Experiments on multiple industrial datasets show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SSLF successfully addresses SLF optimization challenges and demonstrates superior performance through sharpness-aware second-order optimization.

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: CMGQ is a fine-tuning-free quantization method for large language models that selects the best PTQ algorithm per layer using CKA similarity, outperforming uniform and mixed-precision baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training quantization methods uniformly apply strategies across layers, ignoring algorithm suitability differences, which hinders quantization efficiency.

Method: Evaluates multiple quantization algorithms per layer and uses Linear Centered Kernel Alignment to select optimal ones, combining them into a hybrid quantized model.

Result: CMGQ surpasses uniform quantization and state-of-the-art methods in perplexity and downstream tasks across models like LLaMA and Qwen.

Conclusion: Layer-specific algorithmic quantization with CKA guidance enhances quantization performance, offering a plug-and-play alternative to uniform strategies.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

TL;DR: Proposes SRMU, a novel activation-editing framework for machine unlearning that selectively suppresses harmful knowledge while preserving utility, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods assume clean dataset separation, which is unrealistic in practical settings with entangled distributions. Existing perturbation-based approaches often degrade model utility or fail to ensure safety.

Method: SRMU employs feature-aware, directionally controlled perturbations using a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map to selectively suppress harmful representations.

Result: Experiments on WMDP benchmark show SRMU delivers superior unlearning performance with minimal utility loss, remaining effective under 20-30% dataset overlap where baselines fail.

Conclusion: SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in LLM applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

It learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery datasets and applies transfer learning to adapt across diverse conditions.

Result: PBT outperforms existing models by an average of 19.8% and achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse lithium-ion battery datasets, covering various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries through transfer learning.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems by addressing data limitations and enabling accurate, generalizable predictions.

Abstract: Early prediction of battery cycle life is essential for accelerating battery research, manufacturing, and deployment. Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs. This work establishes a foundation model pathway for battery lifetime prediction, paving the way toward universal battery lifetime prediction systems.

### [119] [Multivariate Uncertainty Quantification with Tomographic Quantile Forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16383)
*Takuya Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TQF is a multivariate regression method that predicts conditional distributions using quantile forests across all directions with efficient optimization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multivariate conditional distribution estimation remains challenging for trustworthy AI applications, and existing directional-quantile methods require separate models per direction with convexity limitations

Method: Learns conditional quantiles of directional projections n'y as functions of inputs x and unit directions n, then aggregates across directions using sliced Wasserstein distance minimization via alternating convex optimization

Result: Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing ability to handle multivariate targets without convexity restrictions using a single model

Conclusion: TQF provides effective nonparametric multivariate uncertainty quantification with improved flexibility and efficiency compared to classical approaches

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

### [120] [Quantitative Verification of Fairness in Tree Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16386)
*Zhenjiang Zhao,Takahisa Toda,Takashi Kitamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantitative fairness verification for tree ensembles providing both upper/lower bounds of counterexample ratios, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness verification approaches only return single counterexamples without quantifying bias extent, and prior quantitative methods limited to DNNs have scalability issues.

Method: Developed model-agnostic quantitative verification using discrete structure of tree ensembles to compute anytime upper/lower bounds of counterexample ratios.

Result: Experiments on 5 datasets show superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art fairness testing techniques.

Conclusion: The method enables practical bias diagnosis in tree ensembles through efficient quantitative verification with rigorous bounds.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kascade is a training-free sparse attention method that achieves significant speedups (4.1x decode, 2.2x prefill) over FlashAttention-3 while maintaining accuracy on long-context LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention is the dominant latency source in long-context LLM inference. Existing methods need optimization for both computational efficiency and maintaining model accuracy.

Method: Leverages observations: 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, 2) high-weight key identity is stable across nearby layers. Computes exact Top-k indices in anchor layers and reuses them in intermediate layers via dynamic programming selection.

Result: Achieves up to 4.1x decode attention speedup and 2.2x prefill speedup over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on LongBench and AIME-24 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Kascade provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating long-context LLM inference through sparse attention, demonstrating both significant speed improvements and maintained accuracy.

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural operator framework with pole-residue decomposition and exponential basis functions for non-periodic PDE dynamics, extending to Riemannian manifolds via Laplace spectral representations, with practical grid-invariant architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator methods struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and irregular/non-Euclidean geometries, limiting their applicability to complex real-world systems.

Method: Generalized operator learning framework using pole-residue decomposition with exponential basis functions; designs Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO) embedded in Laplace-Beltrami eigenbasis; implements grid-invariant network GLNONet for practicality.

Result: Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate robust performance improvements over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The framework and GLNO successfully address limitations in handling aperiodic, decaying dynamics and arbitrary manifolds, offering a scalable approach for operator learning in diverse geometries.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient solutions to partial differential equations across varying inputs and domains. Despite the success, existing methods often struggle with non-periodic excitations, transient responses, and signals defined on irregular or non-Euclidean geometries. To address this, we propose a generalized operator learning framework based on a pole-residue decomposition enriched with exponential basis functions, enabling expressive modeling of aperiodic and decaying dynamics. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models.

*Filippo Zacchei,Paolo Conti,Attilio Alberto Frangi,Andrea Manzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance method using neural networks to combine different fidelity solvers for efficient Bayesian inverse uncertainty quantification, avoiding expensive high-fidelity simulations during online inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based inverse UQ tasks are computationally expensive with traditional methods, and while surrogate models help, they're limited by high-fidelity data costs or low-fidelity inaccuracies.

Method: Extends Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance with multi-fidelity neural networks trained offline on high-fidelity data. Online, uses coarse solvers and neural networks for likelihood evaluations without high-fidelity simulations.

Result: Enables flexible integration of heterogeneous coarse solvers, improves low-fidelity accuracy, leads to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference, demonstrated on groundwater flow and reaction-diffusion benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses computational challenges in inverse UQ by leveraging multi-fidelity modeling, showing significant computational savings and robustness.

Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.

*Maeve Madigan,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Glenn Moynihan,Tom Kempton,David Sutton,Stuart Burrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Need for fairness evaluation in multi-agent systems for financial applications to detect emergent bias not traceable to individual agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of effective evaluation methodologies prevents safe deployment of multi-agent systems in high-stakes domains like finance, where bias leads to regulatory breaches and financial loss.

Method: Develop fairness evaluation methodologies and measure fairness characteristics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations with varying communication/collaboration mechanisms.

Result: Revealed patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating collective behaviors in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Fairness risks are significant component of model risk in financial multi-agent systems; must evaluate as holistic entities rather than analyzing constituent components separately.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

*Roman Akramov,Artem Khamatullin,Svetlana Glazyrina,Maksim Kryzhanovskiy,Roman Ischenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares four methods for selecting the optimal number of topics in Latent Dirichlet Allocation, showing that learned amortized optimizers like SABBO and PABBO are more efficient than hand-designed evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Choosing the number of topics in LDA is crucial for model fit and interpretability, but it is often treated as a discrete black-box optimization problem where evaluating each candidate requires training an LDA model, making efficiency important.

Method: Formulate topic number selection as a discrete black-box optimization, using validation perplexity as the objective, and compare four optimizers: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolution Strategy (ES), Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO), and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Experiments are conducted under a fixed evaluation budget.

Result: While all methods eventually achieve similar perplexity levels, amortized optimizers (PABBO and SABBO) are more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO finds near-optimal topic numbers after essentially one evaluation, PABBO within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget.

Conclusion: Amortized optimization methods like SABBO and PABBO offer superior efficiency for selecting the number of topics in LDA, making them practical alternatives to traditional evolutionary algorithms in resource. 

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

*Shabnam Bagheri Marzijarani,Mohammad Zolfaghari,Hedieh Sajedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a CNN combined with HOSVD classifier for automated detection of ALL from blood images within an IoMT framework, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALL is fatal if not diagnosed early; manual diagnosis is error-prone and slow; AI-based methods are needed to improve accuracy and speed.

Method: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) classifier is applied to microscopic blood images for classifying ALL vs. normal cells within an IoMT structure.

Result: The model was tested on the ALL-IDB2 dataset and achieved an average accuracy of 98.88%.

Conclusion: The CNN-HOSVD approach integrated with IoMT enables efficient and accurate leukemia detection, allowing real-time communication between patients and clinicians.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step.

TL;DR: Fully integer-only quantized neural networks without batch normalization, trained via progressive layer-wise distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remove dependency on batch normalization to enable true integer-only deployment for resource-constrained devices.

Method: Progressive layer-wise distillation scheme using BN-enabled teacher to train BN-free student with integer arithmetic.

Result: Competitive Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with AlexNet under aggressive quantization.

Conclusion: Enables end-to-end integer-only inference for edge and embedded devices with standard quantization workflows.

Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.

*Daniël Bot,Leland McInnes,Jan Aerts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLSCAN is a novel density-based clustering algorithm that automatically identifies stable clusters across varying minimum cluster sizes, outperforming HDBSCAN* in accuracy and sensitivity while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density-based clustering algorithms require hyperparameter tuning (like minimum cluster size in HDBSCAN*) which is challenging without prior knowledge of data distribution. PLSCAN addresses this by eliminating the need for manual parameter selection.

Method: PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. It efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes where HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters.

Result: PLSCAN achieves higher average Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) than HDBSCAN* on real-world datasets and is less sensitive to changes in mutual reachability neighbors. Computational costs are competitive with k-Means in low dimensions and scale similarly to HDBSCAN* in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: PLSCAN provides an effective solution for exploratory data analysis by automating cluster detection without hyperparameter tuning, offering improved stability and performance over existing density-based methods.

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Abacus, a deep sequential model enhanced with self-supervised pretraining that predicts event frequency distributions to improve user purchase prediction in advertising systems. The hybrid approach combining Abacus with sequential learning achieves superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User purchase behavior modeling in display advertising faces challenges from sparse positive events and stochastic user actions, causing class imbalance and irregular timing. Current approaches either rely on inadequate hand-crafted counter features or miss useful event-counting statistics in sequential models.

Method: Introduces Abacus, a novel self-supervised pretraining approach that predicts the empirical frequency distribution of user events. Combines this with sequential learning objectives through a hybrid objective function that integrates aggregated statistics with sequence modeling sensitivity.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets show Abacus pretraining accelerates downstream task convergence and the hybrid approach achieves up to +6.1% AUC improvement compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Abacus framework effectively addresses limitations in user behavior modeling by combining frequency prediction with sequential learning, demonstrating significant performance gains in real-world advertising applications.

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based RFFI models suffer performance degradation when deployed across receivers due to distribution shifts, requiring adaptation without source data access.

Method: Proposes MS-SHOT framework with momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and global structural constraints for confident, diverse predictions under label shift.

Result: Extensive experiments show MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness for cross-receiver adaptation.

Conclusion: MS-SHOT provides a practical, scalable solution for source-data-free RFFI adaptation, effectively handling label shift and receiver variation challenges.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data preparation methods for LLMs rely on ad-hoc scripts and unstructured workflows, lacking reproducibility, principled abstractions, and support for model-in-the-loop data generation.

Method: DataFlow provides modular data transformations through a PyTorch-style API with 200 reusable operators and domain-specific pipelines. It includes DataFlow-Agent for automatically converting natural language specifications into executable pipelines.

Result: DataFlow pipelines outperformed human-curated datasets and synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3% accuracy in Text-to-SQL, +7% improvement on code benchmarks, and 1-3 point gains on math tasks. A 10K-sample dataset enabled base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M samples.

Conclusion: DataFlow establishes a practical, high-performance foundation for reproducible and scalable LLM data preparation, providing a system-level basis for future data-centric AI development.

Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for high-quality data in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for scalable, reliable, and semantically rich data preparation pipelines. However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data.

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of ML and deep learning vs neuro-symbolic AI for text classification, focusing on algorithms and feature techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text classification tasks like gender classification have practical applications but often face dataset limitations; this study explores how neuro-symbolic AI can perform competitively despite these constraints.

Method: Compare machine learning algorithms (SVM, NB, LR, AdaBoost, XGBoost, SVM_R) and deep learning with neuro-symbolic AI, using text representations (TF-IDF, USE, RoBERTa) and feature extraction techniques (Chi-Square, Mutual Information, PCA).

Result: The neuro-symbolic approach matched MLP results even with a limited dataset, indicating its potential effectiveness in text classification.

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic AI shows promise for text classification under data constraints, with future work needed to expand the knowledge base, embeddings, and hyperparameters for broader validation.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

*John M. Statheros,Hairong Wang,Richard Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLARiTy is a ViT-based model for joint chest X-ray pathology classification and weakly-supervised localization, using class-specific tokens and SegmentCAM to outperform previous methods by 50.7% while being efficient enough for low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray interpretation faces challenges in multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization due to scarce region-level annotations, requiring methods that work with weaker image-level labels.

Method: CLARiTy uses multiple class-specific tokens to generate attention maps, SegmentCAM for foreground segmentation with anatomical priors, distillation from ConvNeXtV2, and is trained on NIH ChestX-ray14 image-level labels.

Result: CLARiTy achieves competitive classification on 14 pathologies and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization on 8 pathologies (50.7% improvement), with particular gains for small pathologies. The efficient variant works well in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: CLARiTy advances CNN-ViT hybrids by combining ViT self-attention for global context with convolutional background suppression, producing precise, noise-reduced heatmaps for better chest X-ray analysis.

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Predictive Process Mining approaches lack reproducibility, transparency, and usability, making comparisons between implementations difficult.

Method: Propose SPICE framework, reimplementing three popular deep-learning-based PPM methods in PyTorch with a configurable base for robust comparison.

Result: SPICE is compared to original metrics and fair metrics on 11 datasets, enabling reproducible evaluation.

Conclusion: SPICE addresses reproducibility issues in PPM, providing a tool for benchmarking and transparent comparison of modeling approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks remain a major cybersecurity threat with constantly evolving tactics, requiring advanced detection methods.

Method: Ensemble approach combining character-level CNN for sequential features and LightGBM with 36 engineered URL features (lexical, structural, domain-based).

Result: 99.819% accuracy, 100% precision, 99.635% recall, 99.947% ROC-AUC on 19,873 URL test dataset; CNN contributes 60% and LightGBM 40% to predictions.

Conclusion: The ensemble system outperforms individual models, maintains low false positive rates, and effectively detects modern phishing techniques through a real-time FastAPI service.

Abstract: In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable cascade architecture using polyharmonic spline packages to address computational and theoretical limitations in machine learning regression for high-dimensional input spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A direct application of the optimal kernel derived from random function theory is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and breakdown of theoretical assumptions in high-dimensional input spaces with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Method: Construct a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines, with efficient matrix procedures for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation.

Result: The cascade architecture simultaneously addresses scalability issues and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality.

Conclusion: The proposed cascade solution effectively overcomes the computational and theoretical constraints, providing a scalable and theoretically sound approach for high-dimensional regression problems.

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

TL;DR: KOSS is a new selective state space model that introduces a Kalman-optimal selection mechanism for context-aware sequence modeling, achieving superior performance on selective tasks and long-term forecasting benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selective state space models like Mamba lack theoretical grounding and cannot perform context-aware selection from latent state dynamics.

Method: KOSS formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization using a Kalman gain-driven continuous-time update. It employs global spectral differentiation for derivative estimation and segment-wise scan for efficient computation.

Result: KOSS achieves 79% accuracy on selective copying (vs <20% for baselines), reduces MSE by 2.92-36.23% on long-term forecasting benchmarks, and shows robustness in radar tracking applications.

Conclusion: KOSS provides a theoretically grounded, context-aware selection mechanism with strong empirical performance and practical applicability, validated by theoretical and experimental analyses.

Abstract: Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digitalization of Hajj/Umrah services in Indonesia has created opportunities for fraud through counterfeit apps, causing financial losses and privacy risks by stealing personal data.

Method: The study uses a dataset of official and unofficial apps, applying a hybrid feature extraction combining TF-IDF textual analysis of app descriptions and metadata analysis of permissions. Three classifiers (SVM, RF, NB) are evaluated.

Result: SVM outperformed others with 92.3% accuracy, 91.5% precision, and 92.0% F1-score. Key discriminators were keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions like READ PHONE STATE.

Conclusion: The proposed ML system offers a scalable solution to enhance digital trust in religious tourism, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system to combat app fraud.

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), a minimal modification to GPT architectures that integrates energy-based modeling, viewing token inference as energy landscape exploration. It shows this can become gradient descent and demonstrates effectiveness on Shakespeare, ListOPS, and OpenWebText datasets with potential overfitting resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the popular GPT architecture with the energy-based modeling (EBM) paradigm, bridging inference as a dynamical process on an energy landscape rather than standard autoregressive generation.

Method: Proposes eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT) by minimally modifying GPT to frame token inference as exploration of tokens on an energy landscape, with theoretical and empirical validation that it can reduce to gradient descent under certain conditions.

Result: NRGPT performs well on simple language (Shakespeare), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and OpenWebText language modeling, and shows increased resistance to overfitting, only overfitting after very long training periods.

Conclusion: The integration of EBM with GPT via NRGPT is feasible and beneficial, offering a unified framework that maintains performance while potentially enhancing robustness against overfitting.

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

TL;DR: A geometric framework based on vector field theory is introduced to analyze spatio-temporal data from complex systems via new metrics, enabling dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and other key tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex systems like brains or economies have high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics that are hard to model; traditional methods struggle with large spatio-temporal data, creating a need for better data-driven approaches.

Method: Proposes a geometric framework using vector fields over discrete measure spaces, with a two-parameter family of metrics applicable to images, gradients, and functions on graphs and simplicial complexes.

Result: Framework validated with numerical simulations on biological and physical systems; metrics combined with multidimensional scaling successfully enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterization.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems where traditional modeling is impractical but experimental data are abundant, offering effective tools for data analysis and machine learning.

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

TL;DR: MEPIC is a memory-efficient caching system that enables chunk-level KV cache reuse across different positions and requests, reducing HBM usage by 2-5x without model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM applications repeatedly process long prompts containing shared content, creating significant memory pressure on KV cache while requiring high throughput and low latency. Existing caching methods have limitations in reuse efficiency.

Method: MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation to block-level, removes positional encodings via RoPE fusion in attention kernel, and makes blocks fully shareable.

Result: Reduces HBM usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency/accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts.

Conclusion: MEPIC effectively eliminates duplicate chunk KV in HBM while maintaining performance, providing significant memory savings for LLM applications processing repetitive content.

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

TL;DR: TRC is a neural controller using recursive iteration with small networks (1.5M params) for efficient aerospace control, achieving near-optimal performance with low memory (~10MB) and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks with millions/billions of parameters are too large for embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints.

Method: TRC applies compact networks repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting errors iteratively using the same weights.

Result: TRC achieves near-optimal control costs on nonlinear problems (oscillator stabilization, powered descent), with millisecond-scale GPU inference and under 10MB memory—orders of magnitude smaller than baselines.

Conclusion: Recursive reasoning, previously used for discrete tasks, effectively transfers to continuous control synthesis, enabling high performance with minimal parameters.

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

TL;DR: LaMer is a Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore environments and adapt policies without gradient updates, showing significant performance improvements over RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-trained LLM agents struggle with active exploration and efficient adaptation from trial-and-error experiences in multi-turn tasks.

Method: Combines cross-episode training for exploration and long-term rewards optimization, plus in-context policy adaptation via reflection using task feedback.

Result: Achieves 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper, and Webshop respectively, with better generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Meta-RL provides a principled approach for inducing exploration in language agents, enabling robust adaptation to novel environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning to generate pseudo-labels for Online Edge ML, addressing the challenge of labeling unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Edge ML approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. Online Edge ML allows continuous training on edge devices but faces the challenge of determining labels for future, unseen data points.

Method: KT acts as an oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. It is a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning.

Result: Simulation experiments with two setups (less stable and more stable teacher models) show that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can reach its expected maximum performance.

Conclusion: KT is beneficial when the teacher's task is generic (using pre-trained models) and/or when labels for the student's task are difficult or expensive to acquire, potentially enhancing Online Edge ML.

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how optimal task sequencing in continual learning can reduce catastrophic forgetting, using zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) remains a major challenge in continual learning, where learning new tasks degrades performance on previous ones. Existing approaches (e.g., replay-based, regularization-based) are limited, prompting investigation into task sequencing as an alternative angle to mitigate CF.

Method: The method proposes using zero-shot scoring algorithms, inspired by neural architecture search (NAS), to determine the optimal order of tasks as they are presented to the model, enhancing sequencing for continual learning.

Result: Results show that intelligent task sequencing substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting. When combined with traditional continual learning strategies, it offers improved performance and robustness against forgetting.

Conclusion: Task sequencing is a effective approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. It complements existing strategies and has potential applications in fields like curriculum learning, highlighting its broader relevance.

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

Motivation: Machine learning for rare disease diagnosis is limited by data scarcity and privacy/regulatory barriers to data sharing across institutions.

Method: Used Sherpa.ai Federated Learning platform to train ML model collaboratively on collagen VI immunofluorescence images from two international organizations while keeping data local.

Conclusion: Federated Learning substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability for rare diseases, with potential applications in variant interpretation and sequencing prioritization.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes biases in an AI classifier trained on the New York Times Annotated Corpus, focusing on the 'blacks' label as a case study to explore how historical stereotypes impact model outputs in journalism applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI in business and research, including journalism, uses models trained on historical data that may encode outdated attitudes and stereotypes, posing risks in applications like newsroom workflows.

Method: The study involves quantitative and qualitative analysis of the 'blacks' label in the training corpus, combined with explainable AI methods to investigate what concepts it encodes and how it affects model use.

Result: The 'blacks' label acts partially as a general 'racism detector' for some minority groups but performs poorly on modern examples like COVID-19 anti-Asian hate and Black Lives Matter reporting.

Conclusion: This case study highlights the embedded biases in AI models, showing how unexpected outputs can impact journalism tools, and underscores the challenge for newsrooms to adopt AI while mitigating the reproduction of historical biases.

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

### [149] [Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16911)
*Andrew Wagenmaker,Perry Dong,Raymond Tsao,Chelsea Finn,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Posterior Behavioral Cloning (PostBC) improves RL finetuning by modeling the demonstrator's posterior distribution, ensuring better action coverage than standard behavioral cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pretrained policies from behavioral cloning often lack sufficient action coverage, hindering effective RL finetuning. This work investigates how pretraining impacts finetuning and proposes a better initialization method.

Method: Theoretical analysis shows BC's limitations in action coverage. PostBC is introduced, which models the posterior distribution of demonstrator behavior using modern generative models, requiring only supervised learning.

Result: PostBC maintains pretraining performance comparable to BC while enabling significantly improved RL finetuning results on robotic control benchmarks and real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: PostBC provides a more effective pretraining approach for RL finetuning by ensuring better action coverage, leading to superior deployment performance without complex algorithmic changes.

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

*Peter Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Ziniu Li,Wotao Yin,Xi Chen,Tianyi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLM reasoning through paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards suppress exploitation while entropy minimization suppresses exploration, with clipping bias reducing policy entropy for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how seemingly contradictory mechanisms in RLVR (spurious rewards discouraging exploitation and entropy minimization discouraging exploration) both improve LLM reasoning performance, despite unclear underlying principles.

Method: Analysis of policy entropy-performance relationship and spurious rewards' effects through clipping bias and model contamination interplay, proposing a reward-misalignment model.

Result: Clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy leading to more confident outputs; entropy minimization alone is insufficient; spurious rewards enhance performance beyond contaminated settings.

Conclusion: Findings clarify spurious-reward mechanisms and provide principles for more effective RLVR training, reconciling the paradoxical dynamics of exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.

TL;DR: Ev-Trust is an evolutionary game theory-based trust mechanism for LLM-driven multi-agent systems, integrating direct and indirect trust with expected revenue to guide adaptive strategies, exclude malicious agents, and enhance collective performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems amplify risks like deception, fraud, and misinformation, challenging trust establishment and system robustness.

Method: Propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory, with a dynamic feedback structure incorporating direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue, within a decentralized 'Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation' service framework.

Result: Theoretical derivation proves existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria; experiments show it effectively reflects agent trustworthiness, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue in LLM-driven open service interactions.

Conclusion: Ev-Trust provides a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios, enhancing system robustness and collaboration quality.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.
