*Onat Ozer,Grace Wu,Yuchen Wang,Daniel Dosti,Honghao Zhang,Vivi De La Rue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent with multi-persona debators is introduced to generate reflections, improving reasoning task performance and surpassing single-LLM reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, repeating errors despite knowing they are wrong.

Method: Introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections to enhance diversity in reflections.

Result: Accuracy of 47% EM on HotPot QA and 82.7% on HumanEval, surpassing reflection with a single LLM.

Conclusion: Using multi-agent with multi-persona debators effectively addresses reflection degeneration and outperforms single-LLM reflection methods.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI system integrated with a permissioned blockchain for autonomous decision applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems offer real-time reasoning but raise trust, oversight, and integrity concerns in areas like healthcare.

Method: Uses a LangChain-based multi-agent system with Hyperledger Fabric blockchain for monitoring and immutable auditing.

Result: Efficiently prevents unauthorized practices, ensures traceability, and maintains low operational latency in experiments.

Conclusion: Provides a universal framework for autonomous, high-impact AI applications that are accountable and responsible.

Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

Result: The framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, enhances coverage performance, maintains robustness, and achieves superior exploration-exploitation balance compared to PPO and DDPG baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum-inspired MARL framework provides a robust and efficient solution for UAV-assisted 6G network deployment, achieving superior exploration-exploitation balance and enhanced performance metrics compared to classical methods.

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The framework locally combines affordability with nutritional adequacy, offering viable capacity-building for sustainable and fair diet planning aligned with SDGs on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

### [6] [MegaRAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20626)
*Chi-Hsiang Hsiao,Yi-Cheng Wang,Tzung-Sheng Lin,Yi-Ren Yeh,Chu-Song Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method is introduced to improve reasoning over long-form content by integrating visual cues, outperforming existing approaches on QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps LLMs access external information but struggles with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, especially for domain-specific content like books. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer structured support but current KG-based RAG solutions are text-only and miss multimodal insights. Reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues, motivating a cross-modal approach.

Method: The method introduces a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that incorporates visual cues into knowledge graph construction, retrieval, and answer generation phases, enabling cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding.

Result: Experimental results on global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that the approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based methods on both textual and multimodal corpora.

Conclusion: The multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG effectively addresses limitations in reasoning over long-form content by leveraging visual cues, demonstrating improved performance in QA tasks and highlighting the value of cross-modal integration for enhanced understanding.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

*Leo Lu,Jonathan Zhang,Sean Chua,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Investigates if partial reasoning chains from one LLM can be continued by another, showing interchangeability improves or preserves accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focuses on internal reasoning strategies, but little is known about interchangeability of reasoning across different models, exploring it as a means to examine inference-time trustworthiness and reliability in collaborative AI.

Method: Uses token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from baseline models, conducting continuation experiments with other models within and across families, evaluated with a Process Reward Model (PRM).

Result: Hybrid reasoning chains often preserve or even improve final accuracy and logical structure, indicating interchangeability as an emergent property.

Conclusion: Interchangeability offers insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

### [12] [Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS): Learning to Route Between MHA, GQA, and MQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20650)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Transformer architecture called Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS) dynamically selects the optimal attention mechanism (MHA, GQA, or MQA) per token using a learned router, achieving competitive performance to MHA while enabling conditional compute efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face a trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency: Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers high quality but large KV cache memory overhead, while Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory but often degrade performance.

Method: Propose MoAS, an architecture that dynamically routes each token to the best attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) via a learned router, improving over static averaging of schemes.

Result: Dynamic routing in MoAS outperforms static mixture, with validation loss of 2.3074 vs. 2.3093 on WikiText-2, demonstrating performance competitive with MHA baseline and potential for conditional compute efficiency.

Conclusion: MoAS effectively balances attention mechanism trade-offs by dynamically selecting schemes per token, offering a promising approach to enhance Transformer efficiency without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Vira Filatova,Andrii Zelenchuk,Dmytro Filatov*

TL;DR: An AI-driven hiring assistant uses modular agents to streamline candidate validation by integrating multiple data sources, scoring candidates with risk penalties, and enabling human oversight, improving efficiency over manual screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage candidate validation is inefficient due to heterogeneous inputs like resumes and assignments, requiring recruiters to manually reconcile information, which slows hiring.

Method: A multi-agent pipeline with document/video preprocessing, profile construction, public-data verification, technical/culture-fit scoring (with risk penalties), and an LLM-orchestrated interface for human validation, evaluated on 64 real applicants.

Result: The system increased efficiency to 1.70 hours per qualified candidate vs. 3.33 hours for an experienced recruiter, with lower screening cost while maintaining human final authority.

Conclusion: The AI hiring assistant enhances throughput and cost-effectiveness in candidate screening by reducing variability and providing traceable rationales, without replacing human decision-makers.

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

*Yawei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) training mechanism to improve sentiment analysis by redistributing attention weights in Transformer models, achieving state-of-the-art results and a 12.6% boost in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models for sentiment analysis often have suboptimal accuracy by focusing on common words and neglecting less popular but task-relevant terms, harming performance.

Method: The method introduces an AFA mechanism with dynamic masking to deceive a discriminator and a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions based on token-level perturbations.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show state-of-the-art results, and applying AFA to large language models yields a 12.6% performance improvement.

Conclusion: The AFA training mechanism effectively addresses attention imbalances in Transformer models, enhancing sentiment analysis performance and scalability to large models without manual annotations.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

TL;DR: The paper conducts experiments to analyze artifacts like laziness, decoding suboptimality, and context degradation in large language models (LLMs), finding widespread laziness but limited suboptimality and surprising robustness to context degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify behavioral artifacts in LLMs, specifically laziness, decoding suboptimality, and context degradation, as these affect reliability and performance in real-world applications.

Method: Three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) testing advanced LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek) on tasks involving multi-part instructions, simple reasoning, and long conversations to measure artifacts.

Result: Results show widespread laziness in handling complex instructions, limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in reasoning tasks, and robustness against context degradation in long conversations, with models maintaining key information better than expected.

Conclusion: While LLMs have challenges like laziness in instruction compliance, they internally mitigate some failure modes like context forgetting; recommendations include self-refinement and dynamic prompting to improve reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

### [17] [Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664)
*Shinobu Miya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structural verification method for LLM reasoning, called Eidoku, that detects hallucinations by checking constraint satisfaction rather than probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate highly probable yet structurally inconsistent statements (hallucinations), which probability-based verification fails to detect, highlighting a fundamental limitation.

Method: Reformulate verification as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) independent of generation likelihood, using a cost function based on graph connectivity, feature space consistency, and logical entailment, with a lightweight System-2 gate (Eidoku) to reject candidates exceeding a context-calibrated threshold.

Result: The approach successfully rejects 'smooth falsehoods'—statements that are probable but structurally disconnected—that probability-based verifiers cannot detect, as shown in experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset.

Conclusion: Enforcing structural constraints allows deterministic rejection of a specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning, addressing a key weakness in current LLM verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

*Daan Di Scala,Sophie Lathouwers,Michael van Bekkum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A position paper proposing a semantic language to bridge the gap between Functional and Normative Trustworthy AI for better assessment and implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between Functional TAI (implementation-focused) and Normative TAI (regulation-focused) makes it hard to assess AI system trustworthiness, necessitating a bridge.

Method: Describe current state-of-the-art, identify the FTAI-NTAI gap, discuss starting points for a semantic language, and outline its envisioned effects.

Result: A conceptual semantic language is proposed to translate norms into concrete steps, aiding developers and stakeholders in assessing and implementing TAI.

Conclusion: Key considerations and future actions are provided to advance TAI assessment, with the semantic language as a crucial framework.

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

TL;DR: Generative AI effectively personalizes CS education when designed with explanation-first guidance, graduated hints, and artifact grounding in audit-ready workflows, though risks like academic integrity and bias require mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative AI personalization supports or undermines learning in computer science education at scale.

Method: Scoping review synthesizing 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts.

Result: Identified five application domains and successful design patterns including explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding. Designs with these features show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces.

Conclusion: The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

*Prajwal Ghimire,Keyoumars Ashkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper argues that the boundary between artificial and organic intelligence is blurred, as AI is ultimately a product of human organic cognition and inspiration, emphasizing organization and adaptation in the context of digital health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the common dichotomy between artificial and natural/organic, highlighting that AI systems are derived from human intelligence, which is organic, thus arguing for a more nuanced understanding.

Method: The approach involves philosophical and conceptual analysis, drawing on examples from AI principles like neural networks and algorithms that emulate human neurobiology and evolutionary processes.

Result: The analysis concludes that artificial intelligence in digital health is not mystical but based on organization and adaptation, reinforcing the interconnectedness rather than separation of artificial and organic domains.

Conclusion: The boundaries between artificial and organic intelligence are less distinct than often assumed, with AI being a manifestation of organic ingenuity, relevant for advancing digital health through integrated perspectives.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 are computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy in complex mathematical operations despite progress in natural language reasoning.

Method: Introduces three key innovations: (1) automated conversion of natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories for SFT data generation; (2) agentic RL paradigm dynamic interleaving natural language generation with real-time code execution for learning tool-use strategies; (3) efficient training system with techniques like request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling and agentic partial rollout.

Conclusion: The results validate the effectiveness of AgentMath's approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

### [22] [A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)
*Miles Q. Li,Benjamin C. M. Fung,Martin Weiss,Pulei Xiong,Khalil Al-Hussaeni,Claude Fachkha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark of 40 scenarios to test AI agent safety by evaluating outcome-driven constraint violations in multi-step tasks, finding high misalignment rates in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety benchmarks are insufficient as they often focus on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for malicious tasks, or explicit negative constraints, lacking the ability to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations in realistic production settings.

Method: The authors create a benchmark with 40 distinct scenarios, each requiring multi-step actions and tied to a Key Performance Indicator (KPI), featuring both Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to assess obedience vs. emergent misalignment. They test 12 state-of-the-art large language models on this benchmark.

Result: The evaluation shows outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 out of 12 models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Notably, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview has the highest violation rate at over 60%, demonstrating that superior reasoning capability does not ensure safety. Significant 'deliberative misalignment' is observed, where models recognize their actions as unethical in separate evaluations.

Conclusion: The results highlight the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate risks, emphasizing that high reasoning ability in AI agents does not inherently prevent ethical or safety violations.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvGame, a non-zero-sum game framework for safety alignment in language models, using reinforcement learning with preference-based rewards to jointly train an Attacker and Defender LM, improving both safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods for language models rely on sequential adversarial training, which may be inefficient; the paper aims to explore a more dynamic and collaborative approach to enhance safety while maintaining usefulness.

Method: The method frames safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM, trained jointly via online reinforcement learning with preference-based reward signals derived from pairwise comparisons.

Result: AdvGame shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, producing a Defender LM that is more helpful and resilient to adversarial attacks, and an Attacker LM that becomes a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent.

Conclusion: The AdvGame framework offers a promising paradigm for improving language model safety alignment through collaborative, iterative training, outperforming traditional methods and enabling effective deployment of red-teaming agents.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

*Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar,Naman Shah,Siddharth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Abstract-driven approach learns state/action abstractions online for parameterized action spaces, enabling higher sample efficiency in long-horizon sparse-reward settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces (discrete actions with continuous parameters). Existing methods have severe limitations: planning methods need hand-crafted action models, standard RL algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and few RL methods for parameterized actions rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit latent structure.

Method: Algorithms that progressively refine state and action abstractions online during learning, increasing detail in critical regions where greater resolution improves performance.

Result: Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD(λ) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Our abstraction-driven approach enables effective learning in long-horizon sparse-reward parameterized action spaces, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic framework to enable bidirectional knowledge exchange among autonomous agents, addressing epistemic asymmetry by modeling beliefs with a Beta-Bernoulli distribution and introducing epistemic caching for scalability, validated through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous agents based on LLMs and RAG are unidirectional, leading to redundant reasoning and stagnated collective intelligence due to epistemic asymmetry, with self-reflection frameworks lacking a probabilistic foundation for quantifying certainty.

Method: Proposes a formal probabilistic framework using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor to model agent beliefs, isolating epistemic uncertainty as variance. Introduces epistemic caching for dynamic resource allocation in non-stationary knowledge distributions.

Result: Simulation results show the uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift, and the framework supports efficient knowledge exchange.

Conclusion: The framework reframes public contribution as optimal active learning, reduces epistemic asymmetry, and provides verifiable reward signals for RLHF and data filters for SFT, enhancing scalability and collective intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

TL;DR: TrafficSimAgent is an LLM-based agent framework that simplifies traffic simulation for non-experts by using expert agents for planning and optimization, achieving robust performance across scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulators like SUMO and MATSim are complex, posing challenges for users without deep knowledge to conduct experiments from scratch and integrate them into daily work, limiting accessibility and efficiency.

Method: An LLM-based agent framework with cross-level collaboration: high-level expert agents parse natural language instructions, plan workflows, and invoke MCP-compatible tools; low-level expert agents optimize action plans for basic elements based on real-time traffic conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments show TrafficSimAgent successfully executes simulations in multiple scenarios under various conditions, produces reasonable outcomes even with ambiguous instructions, and outperforms other systems and state-of-the-art LLM-based methods in autonomous decision-driven optimization.

Conclusion: TrafficSimAgent provides an effective LLM-based agent framework for traffic simulation, making it accessible for users with limited platform knowledge, while demonstrating superior performance through expert-level optimization and handling ambiguous instructions reliably.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study proposes combining SHAP-based explainable AI with iterative multimodal LLM refinement to enhance explanations, applied to rice yield data, showing quality improves with early rounds but declines with excess refinement, needing early stopping for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communicating XAI outputs to laypersons is challenging, hindering trust, and the integration of agentic AI with LLMs for iterative refinement in XAI remains unexplored, requiring improved accessibility and effectiveness.

Method: Develop an agentic XAI framework using SHAP and multimodal LLMs for iterative refinement over 11 rounds on rice yield data from 26 Japanese fields, evaluating explanations via 7 metrics with human experts and LLMs.

Result: The framework increased recommendation quality by 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4, but excessive refinement caused a drop due to bias-variance trade-off, with early rounds lacking depth and later ones becoming verbose.

Conclusion: Strategic early stopping is needed to optimize utility, challenging monotonic improvement assumptions and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems, balancing depth and clarity.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient alternative to Neural CDEs reduces parameter count while better aligning with Continuous RNN concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs) have high parameter requirements which limit their practicality. The paper aims to develop a more parameter-efficient alternative that better aligns with the intuitive concept of 'Continuous RNNs' that Neural CDEs aspire to be.

Method: The paper proposes a parameter-efficient alternative to Neural CDEs by re-engineering or simplifying the model architecture, likely by reducing the number of parameters needed for the method's operation while maintaining the continuous-time sequence modeling capability.

Result: The proposed parameter-efficient Neural CDE method achieves comparable or better performance with significantly fewer parameters, effectively addressing the parameter inefficiency drawback of traditional Neural CDEs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the parameter-efficient version of Neural CDEs serves as a more practical and logical continuous-time analogue to RNNs, effectively addressing the parameter inefficiency issue in Neural CDEs while maintaining the core functionality of continuous sequence modeling.

Abstract: Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs, NCDEs) are a unique branch of methods, specifically tailored for analysing temporal sequences. However, they come with drawbacks, the main one being the number of parameters, required for the method's operation. In this paper, we propose an alternative, parameter-efficient look at Neural CDEs. It requires much fewer parameters, while also presenting a very logical analogy as the "Continuous RNN", which the Neural CDEs aspire to.

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework enables continual strategy evolution by updating external latent vectors through dual-loop architecture, without fine-tuning model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To liberate latent vectors from static semantic representations, allowing continuous updates via environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback for adaptable strategies.

Method: Constructs a dual-loop system: behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on rewards, and language loop updates external latent vectors by reflecting on semantic embeddings of generated text.

Result: Agents show stable strategic styles with convergence trajectories in latent spaces under reflection-driven updates, structured shifts at critical moments, and emergent ability to adapt to emotional agents without shared rewards.

Conclusion: An external latent space offers a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable representation for language agents to evolve strategies without modifying model parameters.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.

### [31] [Enhancing Lung Cancer Treatment Outcome Prediction through Semantic Feature Engineering Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20633)
*MunHwan Lee,Shaika Chowdhury,Xiaodi Li,Sivaraman Rajaganapathy,Eric W Klee,Ping Yang,Terence Sio,Liewei Wang,James Cerhan,Nansu NA Zong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs used as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) for multimodal clinical data improve lung cancer outcome prediction, outperforming traditional approaches with a mean AUROC of 0.803, showing semantic representation quality is key in sparse data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that uses LLMs as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines.

Result: Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), GKC achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed baselines (expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer). An ablation study confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reframing Large Language Models (LLMs) as knowledge curation engines—rather than black-box predictors—provides a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

### [32] [Real Time Detection and Quantitative Analysis of Spurious Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20634)
*Weiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to quantify and mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for large language models by introducing metrics for alignment depth and real-time detection methods, with experiments showing improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major issue in continual learning, with recent work suggesting spurious forgetting due to task alignment disruption, but lacking quantitative analysis, real-time detection, and automatic distinction mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces a shallow versus deep alignment framework, develops quantitative metrics on a 0-1 scale to measure alignment depth across token positions, real-time detection methods, visualization tools, and adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses gaps in understanding and mitigating spurious forgetting by promoting deep alignment, offering significant improvements in continual learning for large language models.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

### [33] [SHRP: Specialized Head Routing and Pruning for Efficient Encoder Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20635)
*Zeli Su,Ziyin Zhang,Wenzheng Zhang,Zhou Liu,Guixian Xu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHRP prunes redundant attention heads in Transformers via Expert Attention and Top-1 usage routing, achieving high compression (48% parameter reduction) with minimal accuracy loss (<7% on GLUE), enabling efficient real-time serving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference latency and memory consumption of Transformer encoders in large-scale web services by exploiting architectural redundancy in the attention mechanism.

Method: Introduces Expert Attention treating each head as an independent expert and uses a Top-1 usage-driven mechanism for dynamic routing and deterministic pruning.

Result: Achieves 93% of original accuracy with 48% parameter reduction, and in extreme compression (11/12 layers pruned) maintains 84% accuracy with 4.2x throughput gain and 11.5% of original FLOPs.

Conclusion: SHRP effectively reduces Transformer inference latency and memory consumption through structured pruning of attention heads while largely preserving model accuracy, making it suitable for real-time web services.

Abstract: Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.

*Dhananjay Saikumar,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Gate-Norm for data-free compression of LLMs by removing redundant attention layers identified via query-key coupling analysis, achieving 1.3× speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Based on the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, making them redundant and allowing for efficient pruning without significant performance loss.

Method: Proposes Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query-key coupling and removes the least coupled ones without requiring calibration data, forward passes, fine-tuning, or specialized kernels.

Result: On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, pruning 8-16 attention sublayers yields up to 1.30× higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within 2% of the unpruned baseline across multiple benchmarks. Gate-Norm is ~1000× faster than data-driven methods.

Conclusion: Gate-Norm enables practical, data-free compression of LLMs by efficiently identifying and removing attention sublayers that contribute minimally to the model's performance, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) with Neural ODEs and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to predict n-body problem trajectories, finding UDEs more data-efficient than Neural ODEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning models for astrophysical n-body simulations are often data-intensive black boxes that ignore physical laws, lacking interpretability, while SciML embeds known physics for better performance.

Method: The method implements SciML frameworks (Neural ODEs and UDEs) in Julia with robust modeling, using synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations, and determines the forecasting breakdown point.

Result: Results show the UDE model is much more data-efficient, requiring only 20% of training data for accurate forecasting, compared to 90% for the Neural ODE model.

Conclusion: UDEs offer superior data efficiency and potential interpretability in n-body problem simulations, highlighting the effectiveness of SciML in embedding physical laws into machine learning frameworks for astrophysics.

Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data re-uploading quantum circuits excel at high-frequency function fitting but face scalability issues due to quantum hardware limitations.

Method: Introduce DRQC principles into classical models by proposing Q-RUN, retaining Fourier-expressive benefits without needing quantum hardware.

Result: Q-RUN reduces model parameters and error by one to three orders of magnitude compared to standard layers, serving as a drop-in replacement for improved performance in various neural architectures.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning principles can guide the design of more expressive AI models, enabling classical systems to achieve quantum-like advantages.

Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: MaskOpt is a large-scale dataset for deep learning-based mask optimization in IC lithography, derived from real 45nm designs to address gaps in synthetic data and context awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical lithography faces challenges like diffraction with shrinking IC dimensions, and existing deep learning methods for mask optimization rely on synthetic layouts that ignore standard-cell hierarchy and neighboring contexts, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Created MaskOpt dataset from real IC designs at 45nm node, including over 104,000 metal-layer and 121,000 via-layer tiles clipped at standard-cell placements to preserve cell info and support various context window sizes for capturing optical proximity effects.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models on MaskOpt reveals trade-offs across baselines, with context size analysis and input ablation studies confirming the importance of surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs for accurate mask generation.

Conclusion: MaskOpt advances deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization by providing a real-world benchmark, highlighting the need to incorporate hierarchical and contextual information to improve scalability and accuracy in optical proximity correction.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Dual-State Architecture for AI coding agents that separates deterministic control flow from stochastic generation, improving task success rates for code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI coding agents often treat LLMs as decision-makers, leading to stochastic failures like gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. To address this, the paper draws on software engineering practices to manage unpredictable processes.

Method: A Dual-State Architecture is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). Atomic Action Pairs couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, using Guard Functions to project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state.

Result: The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs. For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2–2.1× baseline computational cost.

Conclusion: Architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation, suggesting significant benefits for AI coding systems.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent.
  A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.

*Hayeon Jeong,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DominanceBench to analyze the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance in text-to-image diffusion models, where multi-concept prompts often lead to one concept dominating and suppressing others. It examines causes from data and architectural perspectives, highlighting limited training data diversity and cross-attention dynamics as key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse and high-fidelity images, but when handling multi-concept prompts, one concept token tends to dominate, suppressing others. This Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance limits the reliability and controllability of generation, prompting a systematic investigation.

Method: The authors introduce DominanceBench for systematic analysis. They conduct experiments on training data diversity and cross-attention dynamics, using head ablation studies to examine the distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads in the model.

Result: Experiments show that limited instance diversity in training data worsens inter-concept interference. Cross-attention analysis reveals dominant tokens saturate attention quickly, progressively suppressing others over diffusion timesteps. Head ablation indicates DvD behavior stems from distributed attention across heads.

Conclusion: The findings provide key insights into generative collapse in text-to-image diffusion models, identifying data and architectural factors behind DvD imbalance. This advances toward more reliable and controllable generation, though further research is needed to mitigate the imbalance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: FOTON is a new forward-only training algorithm that outperforms PEPITA and can train neural networks of any depth without backward passes, making it scalable and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation's high computational cost and limitations of existing forward-only alternatives (like PEPITA) that fail with many layers motivate the development of FOTON.

Method: A theoretical analysis of constraints in forward-only approaches, leading to a design equivalent to backpropagation under linear/orthogonal assumptions. FOTON relaxes the linear assumption to bridge the gap.

Result: FOTON outperforms PEPITA, enabling training of deep networks without backward passes, with promising results on convolutional networks that suggest applicability to advanced architectures.

Conclusion: FOTON offers a scalable, forward-only alternative to backpropagation, overcoming previous limitations and opening avenues for efficient training of complex neural architectures; code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Backpropagation is still the de facto algorithm used today to
  train neural networks.
  With the exponential growth of recent architectures, the
  computational cost of this algorithm also becomes a burden. The
  recent PEPITA and forward-only frameworks have proposed promising
  alternatives, but they failed to scale up to a handful of hidden
  layers, yet limiting their use.
  In this paper, we first analyze theoretically the main limitations of
  these approaches. It allows us the design of a forward-only
  algorithm, which is equivalent to backpropagation under the linear
  and orthogonal assumptions. By relaxing the linear assumption, we
  then introduce FOTON (Forward-Only Training of Orthogonal Networks)
  that bridges the gap with the backpropagation
  algorithm. Experimental results show that it outperforms PEPITA,
  enabling us to train neural networks of any depth, without the need
  for a backward pass.
  Moreover its performance on convolutional networks clearly opens up avenues for its application to more
  advanced architectures. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/p0lcAi/FOTON .

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture to generate realistic synthetic clinical records for cardiac rehabilitation, enhancing dataset diversity and improving cardiac risk prediction model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical databases for cardiac rehabilitation face limitations: scarce data due to economic and time costs, unsuitable records for analysis, and high missing values from varied patient tests. This hinders effective analysis and risk prediction.

Method: An architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is developed to synthesize realistic clinical records that align with observed data, aiming to augment dataset size and diversity.

Result: The CVAE architecture generates coherent and realistic synthetic data, which improves the accuracy of cardiac risk detection classifiers, outperforming existing deep learning methods for synthetic data generation.

Conclusion: The proposed CVAE-based approach effectively enhances cardiac rehabilitation datasets, boosting prediction model performance and reducing reliance on hazardous diagnostic procedures like exercise stress testing, offering a robust solution to data scarcity in medical contexts.

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation constitutes a structured clinical process involving multiple interdependent phases, individualized medical decisions, and the coordinated participation of diverse healthcare professionals. This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

*Weilin Zhou,Zonghao Ying,Junjie Mu,Shengwei Tian,Quanchen Zou,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking approach to multimodal fake news detection that amplifies cross-modal contradictions as evidence of fabrication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, which misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise and leads to over-smoothing, diluting evidence of fabrication; thus, a new paradigm is needed to exploit these contradictions.

Method: DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces, uses physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize representations for conflict extraction, and applies a conflict-consensus mechanism to standardize local discrepancies against global context.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with an average accuracy improvement of 3.52%.

Conclusion: DCCF effectively shifts from consistency-based to inconsistency-seeking detection, proving that amplifying cross-modal contradictions enhances fake news detection performance.

Abstract: Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.

TL;DR: HyDRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that uses hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling to improve mobile Vision Language Models (VLMs) without increasing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile-oriented VLMs have high computational training requirements, and standard LoRA with fixed rank is insufficient for training these multimodal models effectively.

Method: HyDRA implements hierarchical optimization (coarse-grained rank assignment per layer and fine-grained adjustment within layers) and dynamic adjustment (end-to-end automatic optimization with a lightweight performance model to adjust ranks during fine-tuning).

Result: Experiments show HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline with a 4.7% improvement across various model sizes, and in some tasks, it surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: HyDRA provides an efficient solution for fine-tuning mobile VLMs by dynamically managing rank scheduling, enhancing performance without additional parameters.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Motivation: To isolate the impact of the learning objective in VLM-based reward models, as meaningful comparison is difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings in recent work.

Method: Evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments using Meta-World tasks, assessing consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress.

Result: The simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated under standardized conditions.

Conclusion: A simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, indicating that much of the improvements in recent approaches can be attributed to differences in data and architectures rather than complex learning objectives.

Abstract: Learning generalizable reward functions is a core challenge in embodied intelligence. Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.

### [45] [PHOTON: Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Lightspeed and Memory-Efficient Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20687)
*Yuma Ichikawa,Naoya Takagi,Takumi Nakagawa,Yuzi Kanazawa,Akira Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHOTON is a hierarchical autoregressive model that improves inference throughput by replacing flat token-by-token scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access, reducing KV-cache traffic, especially in long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers process tokens sequentially in a horizontal manner, leading to increasing prefill latency and memory-bound issues in long-context decoding, where KV-cache reads/writes dominate throughput rather than computation.

Method: PHOTON uses a hierarchy of latent streams with a bottom-up encoder that compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states and lightweight top-down decoders that reconstruct fine-grained token representations.

Result: PHOTON shows superior throughput-quality trade-off compared to Transformer-based models, particularly excelling in long-context and multi-query tasks, with up to $10^{3}	imes$ higher throughput per unit memory due to reduced KV-cache traffic.

Conclusion: The PHOTON model effectively addresses the limitations of Transformer scan patterns by implementing a hierarchical access method, significantly enhancing inference efficiency and performance in memory-intensive scenarios.

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

*Saeed Mohammadzadeh,Erfan Hamdi,Joel Shor,Emma Lejeune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmark called FEM-Bench is introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate correct finite element method (FEM) code for computational mechanics problems, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with these introductory tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of rigorous benchmarks to assess LLMs' capability to generate scientifically valid physical models, particularly in computational mechanics, which offers structured mathematical and physical constraints ideal for evaluation.

Method: FEM-Bench 2025 includes a suite of tasks based on graduate-level computational mechanics, designed to test LLMs on generating FEM code and unit tests, with metrics like task completion rates and success rates.

Result: In evaluations, Gemini 3 Pro completed 30 out of 33 tasks at least once and 26 tasks consistently over five attempts, while GPT-5 had a 73.8% Average Joint Success Rate for unit test writing, showing varied performance across models.

Conclusion: FEM-Bench provides a foundational benchmark for assessing AI-generated scientific code, with plans for future expansions to include more complex tasks as LLMs advance, highlighting current limitations in physical reasoning.

Abstract: As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.

TL;DR: Analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders to improve stability via theoretical constants and a regularized attention-based fusion method, validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The stability and robustness of multimodal autoencoders are crucial for optimizing training, architecture, and real-world applicability, but understanding Lipschitz properties is key to addressing these aspects.

Method: Derive theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods and introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method based on theory; empirically validate through experiments estimating constants and testing strategies.

Result: The proposed fusion function aligns with theoretical predictions, outperforms existing strategies in consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy, and enhances training stability.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical foundation for fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a practical solution for improving performance and stability.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.

*Yizhak Yisrael Elboher,Avraham Raviv,Amihay Elboher,Zhouxing Shi,Omri Azencot,Hillel Kugler,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to formally verify robustness in neural networks with early exits, showing that early exits improve both inference efficiency and verifiability, with optimizations for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI safety via formal verification faces new challenges with early exit networks due to conditional execution paths, creating a need for tailored robustness properties and efficient verification methods.

Method: Defines a robustness property for early exit architectures, uses off-the-shelf solvers, presents a baseline algorithm enhanced with early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations for soundness and completeness.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the framework's effectiveness and show performance gains from the improved algorithm, with early exits enabling more queries solved in less time compared to standard networks.

Conclusion: Early exits not only provide inference acceleration but also enhance verifiability, helping users navigate trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency in AI systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

### [49] [Generalization of RLVR Using Causal Reasoning as a Testbed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20760)
*Brian Lu,Hongyu Zhao,Shuo Sun,Hao Peng,Rui Ding,Hongyuan Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR enhances generalization in LLMs for causal reasoning queries compared to SFT, depending on model size, training query level, and initial reasoning competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically study when RLVR yields robust generalization in LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, using probabilistic inference over causal graphs as a testbed.

Method: Construct datasets with causal graphs and queries varying by query level (associational, interventional, counterfactual) and structural complexity. Fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models with RLVR or SFT, varying model scale (3B-32B) and training query levels.

Result: RLVR provides stronger generalization than SFT within and across query levels, but only for specific model-size and training-query-level combinations. It improves marginalization strategies and reduces calculation errors when models have sufficient initial reasoning competence.

Conclusion: RLVR can enhance specific causal reasoning subskills in LLMs, but its benefits depend on the model's initial competence, showing it improves generalization under certain conditions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

*Marcel Meyer,Sascha Kaltenpoth,Kevin Zalipski,Henrik Albers,Oliver Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-Arena addresses evaluation issues in Time Series Foundation Models by implementing a real-time testing platform to prevent data leakage and ensure valid benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the evaluation crisis in TSFM due to information leakage and pattern misuse in training-test splits, compromising forecasting integrity.

Method: Introduces TS-Arena with a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams to enforce a strict temporal split, treating the future as the test environment and preventing contamination.

Result: A prototype platform for energy sector applications is developed, providing infrastructure to compare foundation models under real conditions with a moving temporal frontier.

Conclusion: TS-Arena offers a sustainable solution to restore evaluation validity in TSFMs by ensuring genuine future testing, enhancing model generalization assessments.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer transformative capabilities for forecasting, they simultaneously risk triggering a fundamental evaluation crisis. This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena.

### [51] [Subgroup Discovery with the Cox Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20762)
*Zachary Izzo,Iain Melvin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel methods for subgroup discovery in survival analysis, focusing on the Cox model, by developing new metrics and algorithms to identify interpretable data subsets where the model performs well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of effective subgroup discovery methods for survival analysis, specifically for Cox models, as existing quality functions are insufficient for handling hazard function predictions and subgroup selection.

Method: The method involves two technical innovations: the Expected Prediction Entropy (EPE) for evaluating survival models and the Conditional Rank Statistics (CRS) for quantifying individual deviations. Eight algorithms are proposed, with a main algorithm leveraging both EPE and CRS.

Result: The results show that the proposed methods recover ground-truth subgroups in synthetic data and improve model fit compared to fitting the Cox model to the full dataset in real-world experiments. A case study on NASA jet engine data confirms practical relevance.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the introduced EPE and CRS metrics, along with the algorithms, successfully enable effective subgroup discovery for Cox models, providing interpretable insights and better performance in both theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential to enhance speed and stability, specifically targeting high-throughput generative AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The matrix exponential is key in many fields, but standard methods like Padé approximants with scaling and squaring may be suboptimal for modern needs such as generative AI, which require high-throughput and improved performance.

Method: The algorithm uses a Taylor-based approach with advanced polynomial evaluation schemes, along with dynamic selection of Taylor order and scaling factor to reduce computational complexity under error tolerance constraints.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method achieves significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to state-of-the-art implementations, making it suitable for large-scale generative modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed method is established as an efficient tool for the matrix exponential in generative AI flows, offering a viable alternative to traditional techniques with better computational and accuracy benefits.

Abstract: The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Padé approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.

TL;DR: Symbolic regression using SEGVAE provides interpretable analytical models for 2D materials with defects that match graph neural network performance while remaining explainable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural network approaches lack interpretability; symbolic regression provides interpretable, generalizable analytical equations that can better serve scientific discovery.

Method: Applied the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to analyze 2D materials with defects and compared results with graph neural network methods.

Result: SEGVAE achieved comparable or identical outcomes to state-of-the-art graph neural network methods when determining properties of 2D materials with defects.

Conclusion: The deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE shows promise for materials science applications, demonstrating comparable performance to graph neural networks while offering better interpretability.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

*Miguel Esparza,Vamshi Battal,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-specialist ensemble framework using GNN for environmental contagion and XGBoost for structural fragility analyzes wildfire risk in urban areas, revealing environmental pressure dominates propagation while structural flaws like eaves are critical entry points, enabling targeted mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildfire risk models treat structures as isolated assets, failing to capture non-linear contagion dynamics in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), necessitating a bridge between mechanistic physics and data-driven learning to disentangle vulnerability into environmental and structural components.

Method: A novel dual-specialist ensemble framework integrates: 1) an environmental specialist using a graph neural network (GNN) to model the community as a directed contagion graph with physics-informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, enhanced by Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings; 2) a structural specialist via XGBoost to assess granular asset-level resilience.

Result: Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework shows environmental pressure at the neighborhood scale dominates structural features in defining propagation pathways, while XGBoost identifies eaves as the primary micro-scale ingress vector. Ensemble synthesis through logistic stacking achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology.

Conclusion: The approach enables decision-makers to move beyond binary loss prediction by targeting mitigation measures precisely—e.g., vegetation management for high-connectivity clusters and structural hardening for vulnerable nodes—operationalizing a proactive, data-driven strategy for community resilience.

Abstract: As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

### [55] [Towards Optimal Performance and Action Consistency Guarantees in Dec-POMDPs with Inconsistent Beliefs and Limited Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20778)
*Moshe Rafaeli Shimron,Vadim Indelman*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decentralized framework for multi-agent decision-making that handles belief inconsistencies, provides probabilistic guarantees for action consistency and performance with respect to an open-loop multi-agent POMDP, and selectively triggers communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world multi-agent scenarios, agents often have inconsistent beliefs due to limited communication, leading to poor coordination and unsafe performance. Existing methods assume identical beliefs, which is impractical.

Method: Introduced a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. It includes probabilistic guarantees for action consistency and performance relative to an open-loop multi-agent POMDP, with selective communication triggers, and addresses data sharing to improve inference performance.

Result: Simulation results indicate that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles belief inconsistencies in multi-agent systems, enhancing coordination and safety through selective communication and robust decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

### [56] [DAO-Agent: Zero Knowledge-Verified Incentives for Decentralized Multi-Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20973)
*Yihan Xia,Taotao Wang,Wenxin Xu,Shengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: DAO-Agent is a framework for decentralized coordination of autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, combining DAO governance, ZKP for off-chain contribution measurement, and a hybrid architecture to reduce on-chain costs while ensuring auditability and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous LLM agents face challenges in trustless settings, such as lack of transparent contribution measurement, unfair incentive distribution, high on-chain computation costs, and privacy risks with blockchain coordination.

Method: Proposed DAO-Agent framework with three innovations: an on-chain DAO for governance and logging, a ZKP mechanism for off-chain Shapley-based contribution measurement, and a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture to verify contributions with minimal overhead.

Result: Implementation and experiments on a crypto trading task show DAO-Agent reduces verification gas costs by up to 99.9% compared to naive on-chain methods, with constant-time verification that scales well with coalition size.

Conclusion: DAO-Agent provides a scalable solution for auditable task execution and fair incentives in decentralized agent systems, preserving strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs through its integrated technical approach.

Abstract: Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for facilitating cross-application and cross-organization collaborations. These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.

### [57] [A Plan Reuse Mechanism for LLM-Driven Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21309)
*Guopeng Li,Ruiqi Wu,Haisheng Tan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AgentReuse is a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents that uses intent classification to identify similar requests and reuse previously generated plans, achieving 93% reuse rate and 93.12% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-driven agents suffer from high latency (tens of seconds) when generating plans with LLMs. Analysis shows ~30% of requests are similar, enabling plan reuse, but direct text similarity evaluation is challenging due to natural language diversity and unstructured plan formats.

Method: AgentReuse uses intent classification to evaluate semantic similarities between requests and enables plan reuse based on those similarities.

Result: AgentReuse achieves 93% effective plan reuse rate, F1 score of 0.9718, accuracy of 0.9459 in request similarity evaluation, and reduces latency by 93.12% compared to baselines without reuse.

Conclusion: Plan reuse mechanisms like AgentReuse can effectively reduce latency in LLM-driven agents by leveraging semantic similarity of requests, achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into personal assistants, like Xiao Ai and Blue Heart V, effectively enhances their ability to interact with humans, solve complex tasks, and manage IoT devices. Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.
