### [1] [Bayesian Social Deduction with Graph-Informed Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17788)
*Shahab Rahimirad,Guven Gergerli,Lucia Romero,Angela Qian,Matthew Lyle Olson,Simon Stepputtis,Joseph Campbell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid reasoning framework combining LLMs with structured probabilistic models improves social reasoning in Avalon, outperforming humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of social reasoning in LLMs, especially in games like Avalon, where current models struggle with efficiency and performance when scaled down.

Method: Introduces a hybrid framework: LLMs handle language understanding and interaction, while a structured probabilistic model manages belief inference.

Result: Achieves a 67% win rate against humans, outperforming baselines and human teammates, with higher qualitative ratings.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively enhances social reasoning in LLMs, offering a scalable solution for real-time applications.

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

### [2] [Evaluating Generalization and Representation Stability in Small LMs via Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17289)
*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning for small language models, analyzing their generalization in low-resource and OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness and effectiveness of prompting versus fine-tuning in low-resource scenarios and under distributional shifts.

Method: Comparative study across task formats, prompt styles, and model scales, analyzing internal representations for stability and feature abstraction.

Result: Highlights differences in how small models generalize knowledge under each strategy, offering practical guidance for low-data settings.

Conclusion: Provides empirical insights into the prompting vs. fine-tuning debate and practical recommendations for model selection.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

### [3] [Individual Causal Inference with Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17300)
*Daniel T. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Individual Causal Inference (ICI) using Structural Causal Models (SCM) to estimate individual causal effects (ICE) by leveraging exogenous variables for personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal inference methods are population-based, lacking tools for individualized predictions. ICI addresses this gap by focusing on individual-specific effects.

Method: Proposes the indiv-operator (indiv(W)) to formalize population individualization and individual causal queries (P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)) for ICI within SCM.

Result: Demonstrates that ICI with SCM involves inference on individual alternatives, not counterfactuals, enabling personalized causal predictions.

Conclusion: ICI with SCM advances causal inference by enabling individualized effect estimation, bridging the gap between population-based methods and personalized applications.

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

### [4] [TRIZ Agents: A Multi-Agent LLM Approach for TRIZ-Based Innovation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18783)
*Kamil Szczepanik,Jaros≈Çaw A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM system (TRIZ agents) is introduced to automate and enhance TRIZ-based problem-solving, leveraging specialized agents for diverse, inventive solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRIZ's complexity and interdisciplinary demands limit its application; LLMs offer automation potential, but prior work focused on single models. This paper explores multi-agent collaboration for better TRIZ problem-solving.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent LLM system (TRIZ agents) with specialized capabilities, simulating collaborative inventive processes using TRIZ methodology. Evaluated via an engineering case study.

Result: Demonstrates the system's ability to generate diverse, inventive solutions, highlighting the advantages of decentralized, multi-agent collaboration in innovation.

Conclusion: The research advances AI-driven innovation by showcasing the effectiveness of multi-agent systems in complex ideation tasks, paving the way for future decentralized problem-solving approaches.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

### [5] [Resource Rational Contractualism Should Guide AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17434)
*Sydney Levine,Matija Franklin,Tan Zhi-Xuan,Secil Yanik Guyot,Lionel Wong,Daniel Kilov,Yejin Choi,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Noah Goodman,Seth Lazar,Iason Gabriel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems need to align decisions with human values. Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC) uses heuristics to approximate agreements efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI must navigate human environments with diverse goals, requiring scalable alignment solutions.

Method: Proposes RRC, using normatively-grounded heuristics to trade effort for accuracy in agreements.

Result: RRC enables efficient, adaptable AI alignment with human values.

Conclusion: RRC offers a practical framework for AI to dynamically align with evolving human social norms.

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

### [6] [Keeping Medical AI Healthy: A Review of Detection and Correction Methods for System Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17442)
*Hao Guan,David Bates,Li Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of AI performance degradation in healthcare, reviews causes and solutions, and proposes future research directions for reliable medical AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in healthcare face performance degradation due to shifting data, patient characteristics, and evolving protocols, raising safety and reliability concerns.

Method: The paper reviews causes of degradation, techniques for detecting drift, root cause analysis, and correction strategies like model retraining and test-time adaptation.

Result: It provides insights into traditional and advanced AI models, highlighting their strengths and limitations in healthcare.

Conclusion: The work aims to guide the development of robust, reliable medical AI systems for long-term deployment in dynamic clinical environments.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

### [7] [OmniReflect: Discovering Transferable Constitutions for LLM agents via Neuro-Symbolic Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17449)
*Manasa Bharadwaj,Nikhil Verma,Kevin Ferreira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniReflect introduces a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework with a 'constitution' to enhance LLM agent performance, showing significant task success improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent improvements lack generalizable long-term learning and efficiency in dynamic environments.

Method: OmniReflect uses Self-sustaining and Co-operative modes, employing Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques to create guiding principles.

Result: Empirical results show major task success improvements: +10.3% (ALFWorld), +23.8% (BabyAI), +8.3% (PDDL) in Self-sustaining mode, and similar gains in Co-operative mode.

Conclusion: OmniReflect is robust and effective across environments and backbones, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

### [8] [From Unstructured Communication to Intelligent RAG: Multi-Agent Automation for Supply Chain Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17484)
*Yao Zhang,Zaixi Shang,Silpan Patel,Mikel Zuniga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an offline-first methodology using a multi-agent LLM system to transform noisy support tickets into a structured knowledge base, improving RAG system performance and operational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical knowledge in supply chain operations is buried in unstructured communications like support tickets, which are noisy and inconsistent, limiting RAG system effectiveness.

Method: A multi-agent LLM system with three specialized agents (Category Discovery, Categorization, Knowledge Synthesis) processes support tickets offline to create a compact, high-quality knowledge base.

Result: The system reduces ticket data volume to 3.4%, improves RAG performance (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers), and cuts unhelpful responses by 77.4%. It also automates resolving ~50% of future tickets.

Conclusion: The offline-first approach transforms transient communications into reusable knowledge, enhancing operational efficiency and addressing gaps in knowledge management.

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

### [9] [Kaleidoscopic Teaming in Multi Agent Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17514)
*Ninareh Mehrabi,Tharindu Kumarage,Kai-Wei Chang,Aram Galstyan,Rahul Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'kaleidoscopic teaming' to evaluate AI agent safety in complex single- and multi-agent scenarios, addressing gaps in existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation frameworks fail to assess risks in complex agent behaviors and multi-agent interactions, necessitating a more comprehensive approach.

Method: A new framework generates diverse scenarios mimicking real-world societies, testing agents in single- and multi-agent setups using in-context optimization techniques.

Result: The framework identifies safety vulnerabilities in AI models, highlighting risks in agentic use-cases.

Conclusion: Kaleidoscopic teaming provides a robust method for evaluating and improving AI agent safety in complex environments.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

### [10] [Cite Pretrain: Retrieval-Free Knowledge Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17585)
*Yukun Huang,Sanxing Chen,Jian Pei,Manzil Zaheer,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Active Indexing to improve LLMs' citation reliability without test-time retrieval, outperforming Passive Indexing with up to 30.2% precision gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs often produce unreliable citations due to hallucination, and external retrieval introduces latency and noise. The goal is to enable reliable attribution during pretraining without inference-time retrieval.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) continual pretraining to bind facts to document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning for citation behavior. Active Indexing uses synthetic QA pairs for diverse fact restatements and bidirectional generation.

Result: Active Indexing outperforms Passive Indexing, achieving up to 30.2% higher citation precision. Performance improves with more augmented data, even at 16x the original token count.

Conclusion: Active Indexing enhances citation reliability in LLMs without external retrieval, showing scalability and effectiveness across tasks and models.

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

*Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks using a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG) and a multi-agent retriever, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited knowledge. The study aims to improve their performance by leveraging multimodal knowledge.

Method: Constructed MH-MMKG for visual game cognition (Monster Hunter: World) and designed challenging queries. Proposed a multi-agent retriever for autonomous knowledge search.

Result: The approach significantly boosts MLLMs' performance in complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning.

Conclusion: The study offers a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and sets a foundation for future research.

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTFKnow, a benchmark to measure LLMs' technical knowledge in CTF challenges, and proposes CTFAgent, a framework improving LLMs' performance in CTF problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and enhance LLMs' ability to automate CTF challenge solving by focusing on technical knowledge and practical application.

Method: Constructed CTFKnow benchmark (3,992 questions) and developed CTFAgent with two-stage RAG and interactive Environmental Augmentation modules.

Result: CTFAgent improved performance by over 80% on CTF datasets and ranked top 23.6% in picoCTF2024.

Conclusion: CTFAgent effectively advances LLMs' CTF problem-solving capabilities, demonstrating the value of focused benchmarks and innovative frameworks.

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

*Lintao Wang,Encheng Su,Jiaqi Liu,Pengze Li,Peng Xia,Jiabei Xiao,Wenlong Zhang,Xinnan Dai,Xi Chen,Yuan Meng,Mingyu Ding,Lei Bai,Wanli Ouyang,Shixiang Tang,Aoran Wang,Xinzhu Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysUniBench is a multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on undergraduate-level physics problems, revealing significant gaps in current models' reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with physics problem-solving due to limitations in existing evaluation methods, necessitating a more rigorous benchmark.

Method: PhysUniBench includes 3,304 questions across 8 physics sub-disciplines, with visual diagrams, open-ended and multiple-choice formats, and a five-level difficulty rating system.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-4o mini perform poorly (34.2% accuracy), especially on multi-step problems and diagram interpretation.

Conclusion: PhysUniBench aims to advance AI in science by improving models' physical reasoning, problem-solving, and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

### [14] [Beyond Syntax: Action Semantics Learning for App Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17697)
*Bohan Tang,Dezhao Luo,Jingxuan Chen,Shaogang Gong,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASL (Action Semantics Learning) improves App agent robustness by focusing on action semantics instead of syntax, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for App agents rely on syntax learning, leading to OOD vulnerability. ASL addresses this by capturing action semantics.

Method: ASL uses a SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute semantic rewards, training agents to align with ground truth action semantics, not syntax.

Result: ASL shows superior robustness and significantly improves accuracy and generalization in smartphone App operation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ASL is a robust framework for training App agents, overcoming OOD issues and enhancing performance.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

*Song Wang,Zhen Tan,Zihan Chen,Shuang Zhou,Tianlong Chen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework for multi-agent collaboration using sequential communication, improving adaptability and reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on static or graph-based topologies, limiting adaptability in multi-agent communication.

Method: Proposes a sequential structure with Next-Agent Prediction and Next-Context Selection for flexible, task-adaptive communication.

Result: Achieves superior performance and reduces communication overhead in evaluations.

Conclusion: The sequential approach enhances flexibility and efficiency in multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

*Alexandros Evangelidis,Gricel V√°zquez,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to accelerate policy synthesis in large Markov decision processes (MDPs) by dynamically refining the MDP and focusing on fragile regions, achieving up to 2x performance improvements over PRISM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional policy synthesis methods struggle with scalability in large MDPs, limiting their practical application in software-intensive systems like product lines and robotics.

Method: The approach dynamically refines the MDP and iteratively selects fragile regions for refinement, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant performance gains (up to 2x faster than PRISM) in MDPs with up to 1M states.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable and efficient solution for policy synthesis in large MDPs, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

### [17] [Reflective Verbal Reward Design for Pluralistic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17834)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson,Edith Law*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for learning individualized reward models to address the diversity in human values, improving accuracy and sample efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human values are diverse and conflicting, and aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks suppressing minority preferences.

Method: Uses a language model to guide users through reflective dialogues, constructing personalized reward models from their critiques and reflections.

Result: Achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective models and better sample efficiency than supervised learning.

Conclusion: Individualized reward modeling via reflective dialogues effectively captures diverse human values, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

### [18] [Out of Control -- Why Alignment Needs Formal Control Theory (and an Alignment Control Stack)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17846)
*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for using formal optimal control theory in AI alignment research, proposing a hierarchical 'Alignment Control Stack' to improve interoperability and understanding of control methods for AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety and alignment methods lack generalization and interoperability, limiting their effectiveness for controlling advanced AI systems.

Method: Introduces the 'Alignment Control Stack,' a hierarchical framework that applies formal optimal control principles across physical to socio-technical layers.

Result: Provides a structured approach to align and control AI systems, enhancing safety and reliability while addressing regulatory needs.

Conclusion: Formal optimal control theory can bridge gaps in AI alignment, offering a comprehensive framework for safer and more reliable AI deployment.

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

### [19] [Towards Robust Fact-Checking: A Multi-Agent System with Advanced Evidence Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17878)
*Tam Trinh,Manh Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking improves accuracy, efficiency, and transparency, outperforming baselines by 12.3% in Macro F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of misinformation spread and the limitations of traditional and existing automated fact-checking methods.

Method: A multi-agent system with four specialized agents for claim decomposition, query generation, evidence retrieval, and verdict prediction.

Result: Achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact).

Conclusion: The system enhances automated fact-checking by combining accuracy, efficiency, and transparency, aligning with human practices while scaling for real-world use.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

### [20] [Leveraging Large Language Model for Intelligent Log Processing and Autonomous Debugging in Cloud AI Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17900)
*Cheng Ji,Huaiying Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-ID, an intelligent log processing and debugging framework using LLMs for fault location and self-repair in cloud AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of massive, unstructured log data in AI systems for fault location and self-repair.

Method: Extends pre-trained Transformer with multi-stage semantic inference, unsupervised clustering, and reinforcement learning for adaptive debugging.

Result: Improves fault location accuracy by 16.2% over existing methods.

Conclusion: LLM-ID outperforms traditional systems in semantic understanding, learning, and adaptability.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

*Jinjie Wei,Jiyao Liu,Lihao Liu,Ming Hu,Junzhi Ning,Mingcheng Li,Weijie Yin,Junjun He,Xiao Liang,Chao Feng,Dingkang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniGUI introduces a cognitive framework for GUI automation, combining an omni parser engine and GRPO agent for adaptive learning, outperforming existing methods on new and existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents lack adaptive learning and are evaluated with simplistic metrics, failing to reflect real-world complexity.

Method: Combines an omni parser engine for visual semantic analysis and a GRPO agent for efficient interaction path assessment.

Result: CogniGUI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both current and new benchmarks (ScreenSeek).

Conclusion: The framework enables iterative learning and better reflects real-world GUI interactions, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

*Jianyu Wang,Zhiqiang Hu,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel prompt design paradigm where pruning random demonstrations into 'gibberish' outperforms traditional methods, and proposes PromptQuine, a self-discovering framework for optimizing prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging conventional wisdom in LLM prompting by showing that seemingly incoherent prompts can improve performance, and addressing the difficulty of discovering effective pruning strategies.

Method: Proposes PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically finds pruning strategies using low-data regimes, inspired by natural emergent complexity.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse tasks (classification, QA, generation, math reasoning) and LLMs, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The findings encourage mechanistic studies on in-context learning and advocate for open-ended search algorithms to enhance LLM prompting.

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph integrating data from BNF, DrugBank, and MMA to support clinical and regulatory decisions, addressing fragmented drug information sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified national drug repository and support pharmacists in delivering comprehensive pharmaceutical services using AI and semantic technologies.

Method: Constructed medicX-KG by integrating data from BNF, DrugBank, and MMA, involving data extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping, informed by pharmacist interviews.

Result: medicX-KG effectively supports queries on drug availability, interactions, adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes, though limitations like missing dosage details and real-time updates exist.

Conclusion: medicX-KG enhances pharmacy services by providing a unified, data-driven solution, with future work aimed at addressing current limitations.

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents need improved planning, memory, and coordination for complex tasks, which can be addressed by structuring data using graphs.

Method: Systematic review of graph techniques for AI agents, exploring integration with core functionalities and applications.

Result: Graphs offer a powerful paradigm for structuring data to support advanced AI agent capabilities.

Conclusion: The survey aims to inspire next-generation AI agents leveraging graphs for sophisticated challenges, with resources updated on GitHub.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

### [25] [Action Language BC+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18044)
*Joseph Babb,Joohyung Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BC+, a new action language bridging the gap between traditional action languages and modern Answer Set Programming (ASP) by leveraging general stable model semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action languages are limited compared to modern ASP, which offers advanced constructs like choice rules and aggregates. BC+ aims to unify these features.

Method: BC+ is defined using general stable model semantics for propositional formulas, allowing modern ASP constructs to be represented as shorthands.

Result: BC+ successfully encompasses features of other action languages (B, C, C+, BC) and is implemented using ASP solvers via cplus2asp.

Conclusion: BC+ effectively integrates modern ASP capabilities into action languages, enhancing expressiveness and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Conclusion: The paper highlights open challenges and future research directions for DR agents, with a curated repository for ongoing updates.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

*Xiang Yuming,Li Sizhao,Li Rongpeng,Zhao Zhifeng,Zhang Honggang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel two-level framework (CI-HRL) is proposed for cooperative evasion and formation coverage in UAV swarms, combining high-level consensus inference and low-level policy control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high-dimensional challenges of cooperative evasion and formation coverage in UAV swarms under communication-limited constraints.

Method: CI-HRL uses a high-level policy (ConsMAC) for global consensus and a low-level policy (AT-M) for obstacle avoidance and navigation.

Result: Validated by simulations, CI-HRL enhances collaborative evasion and task completion in UAV swarms.

Conclusion: CI-HRL effectively tackles complex multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games in UAV swarms.

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of model merging, which remains poorly understood despite empirical success.

Method: Analyzes model merging from a representation perspective, identifying two key capabilities, and introduces SE-Merging, a dynamic framework leveraging these insights.

Result: SE-Merging significantly improves performance while remaining compatible with existing techniques, achieving dynamic merging without additional training.

Conclusion: Model merging's success relies on task distinction and expert adaptation; SE-Merging effectively enhances these capabilities for better multi-task performance.

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

TL;DR: CoachGPT is an AI-based writing assistant that leverages LLMs to provide personalized, real-time feedback for academic writing, addressing limitations of traditional and machine learning-based tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional writing assistants lack contextual understanding, and while LLMs show promise, they don't teach writing skills. CoachGPT aims to bridge this gap by offering structured guidance.

Method: CoachGPT uses LLMs to convert educator instructions into sub-tasks, providing real-time feedback and suggestions through a web application.

Result: User studies confirm CoachGPT's effectiveness and the potential of LLMs in academic writing.

Conclusion: CoachGPT offers a unique, immersive writing experience with personalized feedback, demonstrating the educational value of LLMs.

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic

### [31] [AI Through the Human Lens: Investigating Cognitive Theories in Machine Psychology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18156)
*Akash Kundu,Rishika Goswami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit human-like cognitive patterns in narrative coherence, framing bias, moral judgments, and cognitive dissonance, influenced by training data and alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs display human-like cognitive behaviors under psychological frameworks.

Method: Evaluated proprietary and open-source models using structured prompts and automated scoring across four psychological frameworks.

Result: LLMs showed coherent narratives, framing bias, Liberty/Oppression moral judgments, and tempered self-contradictions with rationalization.

Conclusion: Findings highlight implications for AI transparency, ethics, and the intersection of cognitive psychology and AI safety.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

### [32] [Chain-of-Memory: Enhancing GUI Agents for Cross-Application Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18158)
*Xinzge Gao,Chuanrui Hu,Bin Chen,Teng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a method for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents to improve task state understanding and information retention in cross-app tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with accurately understanding task states and lack mechanisms to store critical information in complex, lengthy tasks.

Method: CoM captures action descriptions, integrates task-relevant screen info, and maintains a dedicated memory module. The GUI Odyssey-CoM dataset (111k screen-action pairs) is used for evaluation.

Result: CoM significantly improves GUI agents' performance in cross-app tasks and enables smaller models (7B) to match memory capabilities of larger ones (72B).

Conclusion: CoM enhances GUI agents' memory management, with the dataset and code to be open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

### [33] [Reasoning about Uncertainty: Do Reasoning Models Know When They Don't Know?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18183)
*Zhiting Mei,Christina Zhang,Tenny Yin,Justin Lidard,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) in reasoning models, addressing their calibration, the impact of deeper reasoning, and the potential of introspective UQ to improve calibration. Findings reveal overconfidence in models, worsened by deeper reasoning, and mixed results from introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe deployment of reasoning models by understanding and improving their calibration, as they often generate incorrect but confident responses (hallucinations).

Method: Introduces introspective UQ to evaluate reasoning models' calibration, testing if deeper reasoning or introspection improves it. Evaluates SOTA models across benchmarks.

Result: Reasoning models are overconfident, especially for incorrect responses; deeper reasoning increases overconfidence; introspection improves calibration in some models but worsens it in others.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better UQ benchmarks and methods to improve reasoning models' calibration for reliable real-world use.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

### [34] [The Impact of Medication Non-adherence on Adverse Outcomes: Evidence from Schizophrenia Patients via Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18187)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Pim Welle,Jeremy C. Weiss,George H. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study links antipsychotic non-adherence in schizophrenia patients to earlier adverse outcomes (death, hospitalization, jail) by 1-4 months, using survival analysis and causal inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of antipsychotic non-adherence on adverse outcomes in schizophrenia patients, providing clinical and policy insights.

Method: Survival analysis with causal inference tools (T-learner, S-learner, nearest neighbor matching) applied to longitudinal data (3-12 months) from Allegheny County.

Result: Non-adherence advances adverse outcomes by 1-4 months; findings are consistent across medication types (injectable/oral).

Conclusion: Adherence is crucial for delaying psychiatric crises; survival analysis combined with causal inference offers valuable insights, though causal claims require caution.

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A conceptual framework for AI capability evaluations is proposed to enhance transparency, comparability, and interpretability in AI governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of clarity in comprehensively and reliably assessing AI capabilities and risks necessitates a structured approach.

Method: The paper introduces a descriptive framework to analyze AI evaluations, systematizing methods and terminology without rigid taxonomies.

Result: The framework aids in identifying methodological weaknesses, designing evaluations, and supporting policymakers in scrutinizing evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the reliability and transparency of AI capability evaluations, benefiting researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

Abstract: As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and
transparent evaluations are becoming essential tools in AI governance,
informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks.
Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both
comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual
framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured,
descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and
terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework
supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

### [36] [The 4th Dimension for Scaling Model Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18233)
*Ruike Zhu,Hanwen Zhang,Tianyu Shi,Chi Wang,Tianyi Zhou,Zengyi Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores virtual logical depth (VLD) as a fourth dimension for scaling large language models, showing it improves reasoning without increasing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the understudied potential of parameter reuse (VLD) in scaling models, focusing on its impact on knowledge capacity and reasoning.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to analyze VLD scaling's effects on model performance, knowledge retention, and reasoning.

Result: VLD scaling maintains knowledge capacity while significantly boosting reasoning, with parameter count linked to knowledge but not reasoning.

Conclusion: VLD scaling is a viable method to enhance reasoning in models without expanding parameter counts, validated across configurations.

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and adapt classical ML concepts for quantum computing efficiently.

Method: Leverages LLMMA to iteratively generate and refine quantum transformations of classical ML algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates potential for automated QML algorithm development.

Conclusion: Highlights future directions like planning mechanisms for broader quantum-enhanced ML applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced framework leveraging Large Language
Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLMMA) for the automated search and

DeepMind's FunSearch, the proposed system works on abstract level to
iteratively generates and refines quantum transformations of classical machine
learning algorithms (concepts), such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron,
forward-forward and backpropagation algorithms. As a proof of concept, this
work highlights the potential of agentic frameworks to systematically explore
classical machine learning concepts and adapt them for quantum computing,
paving the way for efficient and automated development of QML algorithms.
Future directions include incorporating planning mechanisms and optimizing
strategy in the search space for broader applications in quantum-enhanced
machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IDVSCI is a multi-agent LLM framework enhancing scientific collaboration with dynamic knowledge exchange and dual-diversity review, outperforming existing systems in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scientist agents lack interactive reasoning and evaluation, limiting their effectiveness in real-world research.

Method: Proposes IDVSCI with Dynamic Knowledge Exchange and Dual-Diversity Review to foster deeper reasoning and creativity.

Result: IDVSCI outperforms AI Scientist and VIRSCI in experiments across computer science and health sciences datasets.

Conclusion: Modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLMs improves autonomous scientific research.

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

### [39] [A Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Framework for Analog Circuits' Sizing Relationships Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18424)
*Chengjie Liu,Weiyu Chen,Huiyao Xu,Yuan Du,Jun Yang,Li Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework is proposed to extract sizing relationships from papers, pruning the search space in analog circuit design, improving efficiency by 2.32x to 26.6x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analog circuit sizing ignore prior knowledge and fail to prune the search space effectively, leaving room for improvement.

Method: A large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework extracts sizing relationships from academic papers to prune the search space.

Result: Tests on 3 circuit types showed optimization efficiency improvements of 2.32x to 26.6x.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively prune the search space, offering a novel integration with analog circuit design automation.

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

### [40] [How Robust is Model Editing after Fine-Tuning? An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18428)
*Feng He,Zhenyang Liu,Marco Valentino,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model editing in T2I diffusion models often fails to persist through fine-tuning, with DoRA showing the strongest reversal effect. UCE is more robust than ReFACT. Findings highlight a need for more reliable editing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether model edits persist after fine-tuning, given practical implications like defending against malicious edits or maintaining bias corrections.

Method: Systematic investigation using T2I diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, FLUX), two editing techniques (UCE, ReFACT), and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, DoRA).

Result: Edits generally do not persist through fine-tuning, with DoRA reversing edits most effectively. UCE retains more efficacy than ReFACT.

Conclusion: Current editing methods lack robustness; fine-tuning can remediate malicious edits but requires re-editing for safety and alignment.

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular AI system using RAG automates medical device regulatory standard applicability, achieving 73% accuracy and 87% Top-5 recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of determining regulatory standards for medical devices due to fragmented, heterogeneous documentation.

Method: Uses a RAG pipeline to retrieve and classify standards (Mandatory, Recommended, Not Applicable) from free-text device descriptions.

Result: 73% classification accuracy and 87% Top-5 retrieval recall, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The system enables scalable, interpretable AI-supported regulatory science, including cross-jurisdictional reasoning.

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

Motivation: Existing AI risk assessment frameworks lack standardized tools for measuring inclusivity, risking biased and inequitable AI decision-making.

Method: Developed a structured question bank via iterative, multi-source inputs (literature, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks) and tested with 70 AI-generated personas.

Result: The question bank effectively assesses AI inclusivity across diverse roles and domains, emphasizing the need for D&I integration in AI workflows.

Conclusion: The tool aids researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in systematically improving AI inclusivity, fostering equitable and responsible AI technologies.

Abstract: Ensuring diversity and inclusion (D&I) in artificial intelligence (AI) is
crucial for mitigating biases and promoting equitable decision-making. However,
existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking
standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles.
This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a
comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across
five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating
insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks,
and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70
AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question
bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The
question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI
systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL) to enhance structured reasoning in large language models, addressing temporal, causal, and probabilistic constraints. It improves accuracy, interpretability, and trustworthiness in model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often fail in structured reasoning tasks involving temporal, causal, and probabilistic constraints. The goal is to improve these capabilities for robust decision-making.

Method: The authors propose T-CPDL, extending Description Logic with temporal operators, causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. Two variants are introduced: one using Allen's interval algebra and another with timestamped causal assertions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show T-CPDL significantly improves inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration in language models.

Conclusion: T-CPDL enhances language models' reasoning for robust, explainable decision-making and lays the foundation for advanced Logic-RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI applications are limited due to fragmented, non-standardized research data. A unified platform is needed to bridge the gap between diverse scientific needs and AI compatibility.

Method: Developed Airalogy, a customizable, standardized platform integrating domain knowledge and computing skills, featuring AI tools for data entry, analysis, and automation.

Result: Deployed in Westlake University labs, Airalogy demonstrates potential to streamline research workflows and enhance AI-driven scientific progress.

Conclusion: Airalogy successfully balances universality and standardization, offering a scalable solution to empower multidisciplinary research and AI-driven innovation globally.

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

Motivation: Addressing LLM hallucinations in RAG settings, a key challenge for deployment.

Method: Four variants of AggTruth analyze attention score distributions in passages.

Result: Stable performance in same-task and cross-task setups, outperforming SOTA.

Conclusion: Careful attention head selection is crucial for optimal hallucination detection.

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DLBC is a novel MARL method that regulates agent behaviors at intra-group and inter-group levels, enhancing cooperation and task specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in behavioral consistency research in multi-agent grouping scenarios by introducing a dual-level control method.

Method: DLBC partitions agents into groups and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity within and between groups, directly constraining policy functions.

Result: DLBC improves intra-group cooperation and inter-group task specialization, showing significant performance gains in experiments.

Conclusion: DLBC offers a promising approach for behavioral consistency in MARL, with potential for broader applications in complex tasks.

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training LLMs on source code alone (w/o I/O examples) enhances their reasoning via Programming by Backprop (PBB), outperforming I/O-based training in robustness and abstraction learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training LLMs on source code improves their reasoning abilities without relying on I/O examples.

Method: Finetune LLMs on two sets of programs (with and without I/O examples) and evaluate their ability to assess programs without explicit I/O training.

Result: LLMs can evaluate programs without I/O examples, especially when code is provided directly or via chain-of-thought. PBB outperforms I/O-based training in robustness.

Conclusion: Code training helps LLMs internalize reusable algorithmic abstractions, suggesting potential for future work in symbolic learning and model alignment.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

### [48] [ConciseHint: Boosting Efficient Reasoning via Continuous Concise Hints during Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18810)
*Siao Tang,Xinyin Ma,Gongfan Fang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConciseHint, a framework to reduce verbosity in large reasoning models (LRMs) by injecting hints during generation, maintaining performance while shortening reasoning length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 produce overly verbose reasoning, causing inefficiency. Existing methods focus on pre-reasoning improvements, neglecting mid-generation interventions.

Method: ConciseHint injects textual hints (manual or data-trained) during token generation, adaptively adjusting hint intensity based on query complexity.

Result: Experiments show a 65% reduction in reasoning length on GSM8K with Qwen-3 4B, with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: ConciseHint effectively balances conciseness and performance in LRMs, addressing inefficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

### [49] [Steering Conceptual Bias via Transformer Latent-Subspace Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18887)
*Vansh Sharma,Venkat Raman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-ACT, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework, to reliably bias LLMs toward generating code in a specific programming language (CPP), improving accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness and limited generalization of static neuron-attribution methods in steering LLMs for scientific code generation.

Method: Developed G-ACT: clustered per-prompt activation differences into steering directions, trained lightweight per-layer probes, and refined them online for targeted injections.

Result: G-ACT improved probe classification accuracy by 15% overall and 61.5% in early layers for LLaMA-3.2 3B, and showed effectiveness in LLaMA-3.3 70B despite diffuse attention signals.

Conclusion: G-ACT provides a scalable, interpretable, and efficient method for concept-level control in LLMs, enabling reproducible model behavior with practical overhead.

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

interaction style. The model incorporates task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters to optimize performance across diverse retrieval scenarios,

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMET, a transformer-based framework for solving multi-input and multi-scale PDEs efficiently, outperforming SOTA methods in accuracy and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving PDEs with machine learning is challenging due to limited generalization and high computational costs. MMET aims to address these issues.

Method: MMET decouples mesh and query points into sequences, uses GCE for embedding, and employs Hilbert curve-based reserialization to reduce input length.

Result: MMET outperforms SOTA methods in accuracy and efficiency across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMET is a scalable solution for real-time PDE solving, with potential for future domain-specific pre-trained models.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning, such as partial observability and non-stationarity, by modeling agent behavior and adapting to evolving policies.

Method: Uses a decentralized imagination framework, semi-centralized critic, teammate prediction, and prioritized replay for training on recent experiences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like StarCraft and MeltingPot, with strong sample efficiency (near-optimal in 50K interactions).

Conclusion: MATWM outperforms prior methods, with ablation studies confirming the importance of its components, especially in coordination-heavy tasks.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel
transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning
in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized
imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction
module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under
partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a
prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in
as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of
each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PCaM, a Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism, to address foreground object mismatch in Vision Transformer-based UDA by filtering background information and enhancing attention consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foreground object mismatch in UDA weakens attention consistency, hindering effective domain alignment.

Method: PCaM progressively filters background in cross-attention and uses an attentional guidance loss to focus on task-relevant regions.

Result: PCaM improves adaptation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: PCaM effectively addresses foreground mismatch, enhancing UDA performance through attention-guided foreground fusion.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Motivation: To test if reasoning models generalize beyond math/programming/logic into chemistry without domain pretraining.

Method: Post-trained Mistral-Small-24B using reinforcement learning on 640,730 chemistry problems across 375 tasks.

Result: Exceeds general-purpose and specialized models, even human experts, in molecular design tasks.

Conclusion: This method can efficiently train specialized models for diverse scientific domains.

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

*Andrew B. Kahng,Yiting Liu,Zhiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLBuf-RePlAce is a learning-driven global placement framework addressing buffer porosity and ERC violations, improving timing without degrading power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skewed interconnect-cell delay scaling necessitates buffer-aware placement, but existing methods are either computationally expensive or lack ERC consideration.

Method: MLBuf-RePlAce uses recursive learning to predict buffer types/locations, integrated into OpenROAD for global placement.

Result: Achieves (56%, 31%) TNS improvement in OpenROAD and (53%, 28%) in commercial flow, with slight power improvement.

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce effectively balances timing and power, closing the loop in physical design.

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate quantification of multimodal interactions is challenging but essential for understanding information dynamics in multimodal systems.

Method: Develops a redundancy estimation framework using pointwise information measures, then generalizes to interaction estimation with efficient entropy estimation for continuous distributions.

Result: LSMI demonstrates precision and efficiency in experiments, revealing fine-grained dynamics in multimodal data.

Conclusion: LSMI enables practical applications like sample partitioning, knowledge distillation, and model ensembling, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel early exiting method for pre-trained language models (PLMs) using a Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which improves prediction certainty estimation by integrating logits and a new NSP score. This method achieves a 2.19x speed-up on GLUE tasks with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing early exiting methods rely on class-relevant logits, ignoring class-irrelevant information, leading to premature exits and incorrect predictions.

Method: The authors introduce an NSP score to account for class-irrelevant information and combine it with logits in the CAP score for better certainty estimation.

Result: The method achieves a 2.19x average speed-up on GLUE tasks with negligible performance degradation, outperforming the SOTA by 28%.

Conclusion: The CAP score-based method offers a better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, advancing early exiting techniques for PLMs.

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sparse attack method for DNNs under the l0 constraint, addressing poor sparsity, computational overhead, and weak attack strength. It proposes a novel parameterization technique and loss function, outperforming existing methods in efficiency, transferability, and attack strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attacks lack interpretability, suffer from computational inefficiency, and weak performance. The paper aims to develop a method to understand DNN vulnerabilities by optimizing sparse perturbations effectively.

Method: A theoretical parameterization technique approximates the NP-hard l0 problem, and a novel loss function maximizes adversarial properties while minimizing perturbed pixels.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in computational efficiency, transferability, and attack strength, and identifies two noise types for interpreting adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a benchmark for DNN robustness evaluation and enhances interpretability of adversarial examples, revealing insights into classifier vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Referi, a framework that recycles few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs, improving accuracy without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the stochasticity and varying conclusions of LLMs, current methods like majority voting or Best-of-N have limitations such as cost or limited applicability.

Method: Referi uses few-shot examples to evaluate candidate outputs via two scores inspired by Bayes' rule, selecting the best candidate with minimal additional LLM inferences.

Result: Experiments show Referi improves LLM accuracy by 4.8% on average across seven tasks with three LLMs.

Conclusion: Referi effectively enhances LLM output selection without extra training, offering a practical solution to stochasticity challenges.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sample Scheduling for DPO (SamS), an adaptive method to improve LLM alignment by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving states, enhancing performance without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) relies heavily on human preference data quality, but existing data selection methods ignore the model's evolving states during optimization.

Method: Proposes SamS, an algorithm that adaptively schedules training samples in each batch using the LLM's learning feedback to maximize generalization performance.

Result: Integrating SamS significantly boosts performance across tasks without modifying DPO's core algorithm or adding computational overhead.

Conclusion: SamS offers a promising direction for better LLM alignment by optimizing the use of fixed preference datasets.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

### [63] [Keeping Up with the Models: Online Deployment and Routing of LLMs at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17254)
*Shaoang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StageRoute is a hierarchical algorithm for managing LLM deployments and query routing, achieving near-optimal regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of LLMs requires efficient deployment and routing under budget constraints.

Method: StageRoute uses optimistic model selection and budget-constrained bandit routing.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-optimal regret (order $T^{2/3}$) and performs well in practice.

Conclusion: StageRoute effectively balances deployment and routing for LLM services.

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

*Sunan Zou,Ziyun Zhang,Xueting Sun,Guojie Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraSketchLLM enables ultra-low bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) for LLMs on edge devices, preserving performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices face memory constraints with growing LLMs, requiring compression beyond 1-bit limits without accuracy loss.

Method: Uses data sketching, an AbsMaxMin sketch for error minimization, importance-aware space allocation, and compression-aware finetuning.

Result: Achieves 0.5-bit compression on Llama-3.2-1B with competitive perplexity and tolerable latency.

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM provides a practical solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ONH biomechanics and explainable AI improve prediction of glaucoma visual field loss patterns, identifying key strain-sensitive regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction of progressive visual field loss in glaucoma by incorporating ONH biomechanics and using explainable AI to identify critical regions.

Method: Used ONH imaging under varying IOP, tissue segmentation, digital volume correlation, and Geometric Deep Learning for classification tasks.

Result: High AUCs (0.77-0.88) showed ONH strain improves prediction; inferior/inferotemporal rim was key.

Conclusion: ONH strain aids glaucoma VF loss prediction, with neuroretinal rim being the most critical region.

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how memory constraints affect reinforcement learning agents, focusing on the trade-off between memory allocation for world modeling and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource constraints, particularly memory limitations, can significantly alter learning and decision-making processes in reinforcement learning agents.

Method: The study evaluates MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms, analyzing memory allocation strategies in episodic and continual learning scenarios.

Result: Different memory allocations impact agent performance, highlighting the trade-off between world modeling and planning.

Conclusion: Memory constraints introduce a critical dilemma in reinforcement learning, requiring careful allocation to balance modeling and planning for optimal performance.

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

TL;DR: OAT-Rephrase improves zeroth-order optimization (ZO) fine-tuning of LLMs by rephrasing training data to align with ZO dynamics, enhancing performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slower convergence and instability of ZO methods like MeZO in LLM fine-tuning by leveraging optimization-aware data rephrasing.

Method: Introduces OAT-Rephrase, a dual-stage pipeline with a rewriter LLM and semantic judge to rephrase training data while maintaining task relevance and consistency.

Result: OAT-Rephrase consistently boosts MeZO fine-tuning performance across tasks and LLM architectures, often matching first-order methods.

Conclusion: Optimization-aware rephrasing is a reusable, low-overhead enhancement for ZO tuning, narrowing the gap with gradient-based methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

### [68] [Does Multimodal Large Language Model Truly Unlearn? Stealthy MLLM Unlearning Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17265)
*Xianren Zhang,Hui Liu,Delvin Ce Zhang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attack framework (SUA) to recover unlearned knowledge from MLLMs, revealing privacy risks in unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs may retain sensitive data despite unlearning efforts, raising concerns about true knowledge removal.

Method: Proposes SUA, a framework using universal noise patterns to trigger unlearned content recovery, enhanced by embedding alignment for stealth.

Result: SUA successfully recovers unlearned information, demonstrating consistent knowledge reappearance across unseen images.

Conclusion: Unlearning methods may not fully erase knowledge, highlighting vulnerabilities and the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CF-VLM enhances VLMs' causal reasoning by using counterfactual samples, outperforming baselines in fine-grained tasks and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack deep causal reasoning and rely on superficial correlations, limiting their performance in fine-grained tasks.

Method: CF-VLM introduces three training objectives: cross-modal alignment, factual representation stability, and sensitivity to causal edits.

Result: CF-VLM outperforms baselines in compositional reasoning and generalization, showing improved factual consistency.

Conclusion: CF-VLM offers a robust solution for deploying VLMs in high-stakes scenarios requiring reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlgoSelect is a framework for learning optimal algorithm selection using the Comb Operator, proving universality, learnability, efficiency, and robustness. It achieves near-perfect accuracy in empirical tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting the best algorithm for a given problem from a set of options, leveraging data-driven interpolation between algorithms.

Method: Uses the Comb Operator (sigmoid-gated selector) for pairwise algorithm interpolation, extended to an N-Path Comb for multiple algorithms. Theoretical foundations include universal approximation, learnability proofs, and operator theory.

Result: Empirical validation shows 99.9%+ accuracy with rapid convergence, demonstrating near-zero conditional entropy in structured domains.

Conclusion: AlgoSelect offers a theoretically sound and practical solution for automated algorithm selection, with broad implications for AI and adaptive systems.

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

*Zhixiang Chi,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yanan Wu,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance few-shot test-time domain adaptation by learning directly on the input space alongside CLIP, improving performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of relying solely on CLIP's feature space knowledge for domain adaptation, especially with less robust backbones.

Method: Proposes an independent side branch parallel to CLIP, using revert attention and greedy text ensemble to enhance dataset-specific knowledge.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on benchmarks (e.g., +5.1 F1 for iWildCam, +3.1% WC Acc for FMoW).

Conclusion: The approach effectively complements CLIP's knowledge with dataset-specific learning, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeT5-Authorship, a model for attributing C programs to specific LLMs, achieving high accuracy in binary and multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated code necessitates methods to identify the specific LLM behind synthetic content.

Method: CodeT5-Authorship uses an encoder-only architecture with a classification head, evaluated on the LLM-AuthorBench dataset of 32,000 C programs.

Result: The model achieves 97.56% accuracy in binary classification and 95.40% in multi-class attribution among five LLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for LLM authorship attribution, with open-sourced resources for further research.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the
CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant

*Emma Finn,T. Anderson Keller,Manos Theodosis,Demba E. Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-attention in diffusion models enhances global image consistency beyond patch-level mosaics, extending prior theories on CNN-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of self-attention in diffusion models' creativity and image generation, as prior theories focused only on CNNs.

Method: Extends theory to diffusion models with CNN and self-attention layers, analyzing global feature consistency. Empirical validation on a crafted dataset.

Result: Self-attention induces globally consistent image arrangements, verified empirically.

Conclusion: Self-attention in diffusion models improves global coherence in generated images, advancing understanding of their creative capabilities.

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses A2 copula-based data augmentation to address imbalanced data in diabetes detection, outperforming SMOTE with improved ML metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diabetes detection is crucial, but imbalanced data affects ML performance. Copula-based augmentation preserves data dependency.

Method: A2 copula generates minority class data, tested with logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost on the Pima Indian dataset.

Result: XGBoost with A2 copula outperformed SMOTE, improving accuracy (4.6%), precision (15.6%), recall (20.4%), F1-score (18.2%), and AUC (25.5%).

Conclusion: A2 copula is a viable alternative to SMOTE, enhancing ML performance for imbalanced diabetes datasets.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people
are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite
significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

TL;DR: AutomataGPT, a transformer model pretrained on simulated CA trajectories, achieves high accuracy in forecasting and rule inference for cellular automata, demonstrating generalization without hand-crafted priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically discovering local update rules for cellular automata and using them for quantitative prediction is challenging.

Method: AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer, is pretrained on 1 million simulated trajectories across 100 distinct CA rules.

Result: Achieves 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and up to 96% functional accuracy in rule inference.

Conclusion: Transformers can infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, enabling data-efficient CA surrogates for real-world phenomena.

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Zijian Long,Haopeng Wang,Haiwei Dong,Abdulmotaleb El Saddik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASMS (Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming) uses F-MAPPO to optimize streaming in the social metaverse, improving user experience by 14% while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and quality challenges in the social metaverse due to data collection and streaming demands.

Method: Proposes ASMS, leveraging F-MAPPO (Federated Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization) for adaptive streaming.

Result: ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% over existing methods.

Conclusion: ASMS enhances streaming quality and privacy in the social metaverse.

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFINO, a neural operator for fast modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure in underground hydrogen storage (UHS), outperforming FMIONet in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fast and efficient modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure evolution in UHS for energy transition.

Method: Proposes FFINO, a neural operator architecture, parameterizes experimental relative permeability curves, and compares it with FMIONet using various metrics.

Result: FFINO reduces trainable parameters by 38.1%, training time by 17.6%, and GPU memory cost by 12%, while improving accuracy by 9.8% and inference speed by 7850x.

Conclusion: FFINO is a superior surrogate model for UHS simulations, offering significant efficiency and accuracy advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

*Zhenglin Lai,Mengyao Liao,Dong Xu,Zebin Zhao,Zhihang Yuan,Chao Fan,Jianqiang Li,Bingzhe Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies safety alignment challenges in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, introduces SAFEx to analyze and address these vulnerabilities, and demonstrates their impact on model safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment strategies for dense models are unsuitable for MoE architectures, which exhibit unique vulnerabilities due to reliance on specific expert modules.

Method: The authors propose SAFEx, a framework using Stability-based Expert Selection (SES) to identify and characterize safety-critical experts in MoE models.

Result: Experiments on models like Qwen3-MoE show disabling a small subset of safety-critical experts (e.g., 12 out of 6144) reduces refusal rates by 22%, highlighting their disproportionate impact.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for tailored safety alignment strategies for MoE models, as their vulnerabilities differ significantly from dense models.

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

### [80] [Aha Moment Revisited: Are VLMs Truly Capable of Self Verification in Inference-time Scaling?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17417)
*Mingyuan Wu,Meitang Li,Jingcheng Yang,Jize Jiang,Kaizhuo Yan,Zhaoheng Li,Minjia Zhang,Klara Nahrstedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether inference-time techniques like self-correction and self-verification, successful in LLMs, extend to VLMs. It finds generation-reliant methods outperform verification-reliant ones, and RL-trained VLMs lack robust self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if inference-time computation techniques (e.g., self-correction, self-verification) that enhance LLMs also improve VLMs, especially those trained with RL.

Method: Evaluates decoding strategies (majority voting, best-of-N selection) and self-verification in VLMs, comparing generation-reliant vs. verification-reliant methods.

Result: Generation-reliant methods (e.g., majority voting) yield higher gains than verification-reliant ones (e.g., best-of-N). RL-trained VLMs lack robust self-verification.

Conclusion: Inference-time techniques for VLMs show promise, but RL-trained models need stronger self-verification capabilities to match LLM performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of interpretability and explainability in federated learning while enhancing privacy and robustness.

Method: Integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) into federated learning, focusing on feature-specific learning and decentralized training.

Result: FedNAMs provide interpretable results with minimal accuracy loss, identifying key predictive features in datasets like OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris.

Conclusion: FedNAMs improve privacy, interpretability, and robustness, offering valuable insights for sectors like finance and healthcare.

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

*Steffen Schotth√∂fer,Timon Klein,Jonas Kusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in training low-rank neural networks with classical optimizers, proposing novel geometric-aware strategies for faster convergence and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome convergence difficulties in low-rank neural network training caused by the optimization landscape's geometry.

Method: Introduces training strategies derived from dynamical low-rank approximation, combining it with momentum-based optimization to respect parameter space geometry.

Result: Demonstrates faster convergence and improved validation metrics at fixed parameter budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric-aware optimizers outperform classical methods in low-rank neural network training.

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

*Xuanyu Zhuang,Geoffroy Peeters,Ga√´l Richard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes episode-specific fine-tuning methods for metric-based few-shot classification models to better utilize support samples and avoid overfitting, validated across diverse audio datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metric-based models underutilize labeled support samples during inference, missing opportunities to adapt the metric space to the current episode.

Method: Introduces Rotational Division Fine-Tuning (RDFT) and variants (IDFT, ADFT), leveraging pseudo support-query pairs for fine-tuning, combined with optimization-based meta-learning to prevent overfitting.

Result: The approach improves performance across metric-based models, especially attention-based ones, and generalizes well on ESC-50, Speech Commands V2, and Medley-solos-DB datasets.

Conclusion: Episode-specific fine-tuning and meta-learning enhance metric-based models' adaptability to limited support samples, boosting performance without overfitting.

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

TL;DR: A novel DQN-inspired model for predicting buying intent and product demand in e-commerce, combining LSTM and DQN, achieves 88% accuracy and 0.88 AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory, personalizing experiences, and maximizing sales in online retail.

Method: Adapts reinforcement learning to supervised learning, using LSTM for sequential modeling and DQN for strategic decision-making, tested on 885,000 user sessions.

Result: Handles class imbalance well, achieves 88% accuracy and 0.88 AUC-ROC, outperforming traditional methods in capturing temporal patterns.

Conclusion: The model is scalable and effective for real-world e-commerce, improving demand forecasting and personalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model for rectal cancer, integrating AI and multi-view data (MRI and clinical) to improve treatment success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical difficulty evaluation relies on clinical data, but technology allows for more comprehensive data collection. AI can enhance this process.

Method: Constructs a multi-view dataset (MRI, pressed-fat MRI, clinical data) and develops a dual representation incomplete multi-view learning model with missing view imputation and second-order similarity. Uses TSK fuzzy system for evaluation.

Result: The proposed DRIMV_TSK model outperforms other advanced algorithms on the MVRC dataset.

Conclusion: The model effectively integrates multi-view data and AI, improving surgical evaluation for rectal cancer.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes improvements to Residual RL for better sample efficiency and compatibility with stochastic base policies, outperforming existing methods in simulations and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Residual RL methods struggle with sparse rewards and deterministic base policies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Leverages base policy uncertainty for focused exploration and modifies off-policy residual learning to handle stochastic base policies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmark environments and demonstrates robust sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements make Residual RL more efficient and versatile, particularly for stochastic base policies.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

*Furong Peng,Jinzhen Gao,Xuan Lu,Kang Liu,Yifan Huo,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies trainable linear transformations in GCNs as a key factor in feature collapse and proposes Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT) to balance expressiveness and stability in deep architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep GCNs suffer from over-smoothing, traditionally attributed to graph Laplacian operators. The study reveals that trainable linear transformations worsen feature collapse, motivating a solution to preserve expressiveness while mitigating this issue.

Method: Proposes LGT, a training strategy with layer-wise training, low-rank adaptation, and identity initialization to stabilize and optimize deep GCNs.

Result: LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, even in 32-layer settings, and enhances existing methods like PairNorm and ContraNorm.

Conclusion: LGT provides a scalable, architecture-agnostic framework for training deep GCNs, balancing expressiveness and stability.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving parametric PDEs lack expressiveness or face computational challenges due to high dimensionality.

Method: LFR-PINO uses a layered hypernetwork for specialized parameter generation and frequency-domain reduction to cut parameter count.

Result: Achieves significant error reduction (22.8%-68.7%) and memory savings (28.6%-69.3%) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: LFR-PINO balances computational efficiency and solution accuracy, proving effective for universal PDE solving.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize
across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited
expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational
challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

*Chicheng Zhang,Yihan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on active multi-distribution learning, providing improved label complexity bounds in both realizable and agnostic settings, and establishes optimality for some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scarcity of research on active multi-distribution learning, where existing algorithms' optimality is unknown, and to improve understanding of sample complexity.

Method: The authors develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution learning and analyze their label complexity in distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings.

Result: They prove upper bounds for label complexity in realizable and agnostic settings, showing optimality in the realizable case and fundamental limits in the agnostic case.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of active multi-distribution learning, providing tight bounds and highlighting key challenges, with potential applications in collaborative learning, fairness, and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of

*Ibrahim Ahmed,Clemens Schaefer,Gil Tabak,Denis Vnukov,Zenong Zhang,Felix chern,Anatoliy Yevtushenko,Andy Davis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EQuARX introduces a dynamic block-wise quantized AllReduce for TPUs, improving speed by 1.8X over BF16 AllReduce with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to inter-device communication overhead in distributed serving. Quantizing collectives like AllReduce is difficult due to numerical instability.

Method: Developed EQuARX, a native dynamic block-wise quantized AllReduce within the XLA compiler for TPUs, using TPU-friendly quantization and deep pipelining.

Result: Achieves 1.8X speedup over BF16 AllReduce, accelerates Gemma 3 27B by 1.25X and 12B by 1.1X in prefill stage, with negligible quality impact.

Conclusion: EQuARX effectively reduces communication overhead in LLM deployment, enhancing performance without compromising quality.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

### [92] [Trustworthy Chronic Disease Risk Prediction For Self-Directed Preventive Care via Medical Literature Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17620)
*Minh Le,Khoi Ton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes deep learning models for predicting chronic disease risk using personal and lifestyle factors, validated with SHAP-based explainability against medical literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models rely on medical test data, limiting proactive self-assessment, and lack validated explainability, reducing trust.

Method: Developed deep learning models using personal/lifestyle factors, with SHAP-based explainability validated against medical literature.

Result: Models' influential features align with medical literature, showing trustworthiness across 13 diseases.

Conclusion: This approach provides a foundation for trustworthy self-directed preventive care tools, with future work needed on ethical use.

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

*Ravishka Rathnasuriya,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores security risks in dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) due to input-dependent execution, highlighting efficiency vulnerabilities and proposing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient deep learning inference under constraints has led to DDLSs, but their dynamic nature introduces unexplored security risks.

Method: The study investigates security implications of DDLSs, surveys attack strategies, and identifies gaps in defenses.

Result: DDLSs expose efficiency vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs, with current defenses lacking coverage.

Conclusion: The work aims to develop targeted defenses to ensure robustness in DDLSs against efficiency attacks.

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

*Zesen Wang,Yonggang Li,Lijuan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-Prompt is a novel framework for time series forecasting using large language models (LLMs), addressing shortcomings like lack of unified prompts and modality discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for time series forecasting lack a unified prompt paradigm and ignore modality differences between text and time series.

Method: LLM-Prompt integrates multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment, using learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts, followed by cross-modal fusion.

Result: The framework outperforms on 6 public and 3 carbon emission datasets, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt is a powerful and versatile solution for time series forecasting, leveraging LLMs with improved prompt design and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

*Manhin Poon,XiangXiang Dai,Xutong Liu,Fang Kong,John C. S. Lui,Jinhang Zuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a contextual bandit framework for adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online setting, addressing challenges like unstructured prompt dynamics and variable costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the most suitable LLM for user queries is complex due to diverse behaviors, costs, and strengths. Existing methods lack adaptability to dynamic prompt changes and real-time constraints.

Method: Proposes a LinUCB-based algorithm for sequential LLM selection, with extensions for budget-awareness and positional preferences. No offline training is required.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms existing LLM routing strategies in accuracy and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: Contextual bandits are effective for real-time, adaptive LLM selection, offering theoretical guarantees and practical advantages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing
strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of
contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

### [96] [Learning Personalized Utility Functions for Drivers in Ride-hailing Systems Using Ensemble Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17672)
*Weiming Mai,Jie Gao,Oded Cats*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hypernetwork and ensemble learning method to predict ride-hailing drivers' decisions, improving accuracy and personalization over traditional linear models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models like RUM fail to capture non-linear interactions and personalized driver preferences, limiting prediction accuracy in ride-hailing systems.

Method: Uses hypernetworks to dynamically generate weights for utility functions and ensemble learning to enhance adaptability and reduce overfitting.

Result: The model outperforms in accuracy and uncertainty estimation, revealing personalized driver preferences and key decision attributes.

Conclusion: The approach balances explainability and uncertainty quantification, offering a robust tool for understanding and predicting driver decisions.

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

*Seonglae Cho,Harryn Oh,Donghyun Lee,Luis Eduardo Rodrigues Vieira,Andrew Bermingham,Ziad El Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaithfulSAE improves SAE stability and feature accuracy by training on model-generated synthetic data, reducing dependency on external datasets and fake features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability and fake features in SAEs caused by training on OOD external datasets.

Method: Propose FaithfulSAE, training SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset to reduce OOD issues.

Result: FaithfulSAEs show better stability, outperform web-trained SAEs in probing tasks, and reduce fake features in most models.

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE enhances interpretability by better capturing model-internal features and emphasizes the importance of SAE training datasets.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

to transform load-displacement sequences into images, capturing
spatial-temporal features and employs a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model
with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by multi-head
cross-attention to improved accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy, with minimum and
maximum mean absolute errors of 0.15 MPa and 5.58 MPa, respectively. The
proposed method offers a promising alternative to traditional experimental
techniques in materials science, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of true

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GNN vulnerability to model extraction attacks (MEAs) and proposes an adaptive node querying strategy for efficient model acquisition in research, especially where labeling is costly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security threats of MEAs in GNNs and explore ethical, cost-effective methods for model acquisition in low-resource research settings.

Method: Proposes an iterative node querying strategy that refines selection over learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback under strict query-size constraints.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score, demonstrating GNN susceptibility to MEAs and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Highlights GNN vulnerability to MEAs and the potential of ethical, efficient acquisition methods for low-resource research.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

TL;DR: SYNC introduces a time-aware causal model to address evolving domain generalization by capturing dynamic causal factors and mechanism drifts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EDG methods fail to avoid spurious correlations, limiting generalization in dynamic scenarios.

Method: SYNC uses a time-aware SCM and sequential VAE with information-theoretic objectives to learn causal representations.

Result: SYNC achieves superior temporal generalization on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SYNC effectively addresses evolving domain generalization by learning time-aware causal representations.

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

Motivation: Uncertainties in retired EV battery degradation and data inaccessibility hinder safe, scalable deployment in low-carbon energy systems.

Method: PIMOE combines Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts with adaptive multi-degradation prediction and use-dependent recurrent networks for long-term trajectory forecasting.

Result: Validated on 207 batteries, PIMOE achieves 0.88% MAPE, 50% faster computation, and works with pruned data (5MB).

Conclusion: PIMOE provides a deployable, history-free solution for assessing and optimizing second-life battery storage in sustainable energy systems.

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into
the sustainable energy landscape.

Motivation: Current spectral analysis methods suffer from single-modality data reliance, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability.

Method: Proposes a framework transforming raw spectra into Textual Graphs (TAGs), merging them with prior knowledge and using LLMs and Graph Neural Networks for downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves high performance in spectral analysis tasks, robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings, and effective learning from limited data.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities.

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,
unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological synapses exhibit log-normal distributions and stable functioning under noisy conditions, prompting the exploration of similar multiplicative dynamics in artificial networks.

Method: A Bayesian learning rule assuming log-normal posterior distributions over weights is derived, leading to the LMD algorithm, which uses multiplicative updates with noise and regularization.

Result: LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch for Vision Transformer and GPT-2 under low-precision conditions.

Conclusion: Multiplicative dynamics, inspired by biology, may enhance stability and efficiency in low-precision learning for future hardware.

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as
Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that
LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision
forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that
multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision
inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

TL;DR: PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter foundation model for physics simulation, addressing data scarcity and outperforming task-specific baselines by leveraging autoregressive tokenization and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models excel in video, image, and language but lag in physics simulation due to data scarcity and scale variability.

Method: PhysiX uses a discrete tokenizer to encode multi-scale physics processes and an autoregressive next-token prediction objective, with a refinement module to reduce discretization errors.

Result: PhysiX outperforms task-specific baselines and state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark, demonstrating successful knowledge transfer from natural videos.

Conclusion: Joint training across diverse physics tasks enables synergistic learning, overcoming data limitations in the field.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of translating ML model outputs into actionable decisions in complex workflows motivates the integration with PyReason for logical reasoning.

Method: The approach combines ML model outputs with PyReason, a temporal logic programming engine, converting real-valued outputs into logical facts for dynamic reasoning.

Result: The integration enables real-time adaptive decision-making, temporal reasoning, and explainable analysis across domains like manufacturing and healthcare.

Conclusion: Combining ML perception with PyReason's logical deduction creates a powerful system for automating complex processes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

*Andrei Cristian Nica,Akshaya Vishnu Kudlu Shanbhogue,Harshil Shah,Aleix Cambray,Tudor Berariu,Lucas Maystre,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UIExplore-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating UI exploration by autonomous agents, using Structured and Screen modes, with a proposed hUFO metric to measure effectiveness. UIExplore-AlGo leads in performance but still lags behind human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic evaluation for UI exploration, a crucial phase for autonomous agents.

Method: The benchmark tests agents in Structured (layout info) or Screen (GUI-only) modes across three levels in a GitLab sandbox, using hUFO to quantify exploration effectiveness.

Result: UIExplore-AlGo achieves 77.2% (Structured) and 59.0% (Screen) of human performance at 2,000 steps, with notable success at the Sparse level.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals a performance gap between agents and humans, highlighting the need for further research. Resources are released to aid future work.

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable
task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We
introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI
exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode
(granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying
on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

### [107] [Beyond instruction-conditioning, MoTE: Mixture of Task Experts for Multi-task Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17781)
*Miguel Romero,Shuoyang Ding,Corey D. Barret,Georgiana Dinu,George Karypis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block to overcome limitations of instruction-conditioning in low-capacity models, achieving significant performance gains in retrieval and other tasks without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-conditioning in low-capacity models limits performance gains for embedding specialization, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: Proposes MoTE transformer block with task-specialized parameters trained using Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (TACL).

Result: MoTE achieves 64% higher gains in retrieval (+3.27 ‚Üí +5.21) and 43% higher gains overall (+1.81 ‚Üí +2.60) without additional costs.

Conclusion: MoTE effectively enhances embedding specialization in low-capacity models without altering instructions, data, or computational overhead.

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

### [108] [SING: SDE Inference via Natural Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17796)
*Amber Hu,Henry Smith,Scott Linderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SING (SDE Inference via Natural Gradients) is a new method for efficient and stable variational inference in latent SDE models, outperforming prior methods in state inference and drift estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact posterior inference in latent SDE models is intractable, and existing VI methods suffer from slow convergence and instability.

Method: SING uses natural gradient VI to exploit model geometry, approximates intractable integrals, and parallelizes computations.

Result: SING provides theoretical guarantees and outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation, including in neural dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: SING is a promising tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems with limited prior knowledge.

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

### [109] [Reimagining Parameter Space Exploration with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17807)
*Lijun Zhang,Xiao Liu,Hui Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative method using diffusion models to produce task-specific neural network parameters directly from task identity, eliminating fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To avoid time-consuming task-specific fine-tuning and reliance on labeled data by generating parameters directly.

Method: Uses diffusion models to learn and synthesize task-specific parameters from task identifiers.

Result: Effective for seen tasks and multi-task interpolation but fails for unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential for parameter generation but highlights limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

### [110] [Flatness After All?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17809)
*Neta Shoham,Liron Mor-Yosef,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a soft rank measure of the Hessian to assess generalization in neural networks, showing it works well for calibrated models and connects to the Takeuchi Information Criterion for non-calibrated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in using flatness (measured by Hessian curvature) for generalization, especially in overparameterized networks, and provide a more reliable measure.

Method: Introduces a soft rank measure of the Hessian for flatness, validated on calibrated neural networks and linked to the Takeuchi Information Criterion for non-calibrated models.

Result: The proposed measure accurately captures the generalization gap for calibrated models and provides reliable estimates for non-calibrated ones, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The soft rank measure of the Hessian is a robust tool for assessing generalization, bridging gaps in existing flatness-based methods.

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

### [111] [Actionable Interpretability via Causal Hypergraphs: Unravelling Batch Size Effects in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17826)
*Zhongtian Sun,Anoushka Harit,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGCNet, a hypergraph-based causal framework, explores how batch size affects generalization in graph and text domains, outperforming baselines and revealing smaller batches enhance generalization via stochasticity and flatter minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the causal mechanisms of batch size on generalization in graph and text domains, which are underexplored compared to vision tasks.

Method: Uses hypergraph-based deep structural causal models (DSCMs) to capture higher-order interactions and employs do-calculus to quantify batch size effects.

Result: HGCNet outperforms baselines (GCN, GAT, PI-GNN, BERT, RoBERTa) and shows smaller batch sizes improve generalization through stochasticity and flatter minima.

Conclusion: Smaller batch sizes causally enhance generalization, offering interpretable insights for optimizing training strategies in deep learning.

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

### [112] [Aligning Frozen LLMs by Reinforcement Learning: An Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17828)
*Xinnan Zhang,Chenliang Li,Siliang Zeng,Jiaxiang Li,Zhongruo Wang,Kaixiang Lin,Songtao Lu,Alfredo Garcia,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IRO is a reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs without modifying model parameters, using iterative resampling and lightweight value functions for test-time guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RLHF and DPO require model weight access and fine-tuning, while test-time methods are costly and suboptimal due to imperfect reward functions.

Method: IRO iteratively samples candidates, resamples using value functions, and trains lightweight value functions to guide generation without weight updates.

Result: IRO enables alignment of frozen base models without weight access, offering a cost-effective and flexible alternative to fine-tuning.

Conclusion: IRO provides a practical solution for aligning LLMs with human preferences without model weight access, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

### [113] [Causal Spherical Hypergraph Networks for Modelling Social Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17840)
*Anoushka Harit,Zhongtian Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal-SphHN is a framework for socially grounded prediction, modeling higher-order structure, directional influence, and uncertainty via hyperspherical embeddings and hyperedges. It outperforms baselines in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of human social behavior, which involves uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics, by developing a unified causal-geometric approach.

Method: Represents individuals as hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, uses Shannon entropy for uncertainty, Granger-informed subgraphs for causality, and angular message-passing for information propagation.

Result: Improves predictive accuracy, robustness, and calibration on datasets like SNARE, PHEME, and AMIGOS, and enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns.

Conclusion: Causal-SphHN provides a unified and interpretable framework for learning in dynamic social environments under uncertainty.

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

### [114] [A Comparative Study of Open-Source Libraries for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation: SDV vs. SynthCity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17847)
*Cristian Del Gobbo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates six tabular synthetic data generators from SDV and Synthicity libraries, comparing their performance in statistical similarity and predictive utility under low-data regimes. Bayesian Network (Synthicity) excelled in fidelity, while TVAE (SDV) performed best in predictive tasks. SDV was noted for better documentation and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality training data is essential for LLMs but hard to obtain, especially for smaller organizations. Synthetic data generators offer a scalable and privacy-preserving solution.

Method: Evaluated six generators using a real-world dataset (UCI) in low-data regimes (1,000 rows). Tested statistical similarity and predictive utility under 1:1 and 1:10 input-output ratios.

Result: Bayesian Network (Synthicity) had highest fidelity; TVAE (SDV) performed best in predictive tasks for 1:10. SDV was more user-friendly.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generators are viable, with trade-offs between fidelity and predictive utility. SDV is recommended for its accessibility.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

*Suyash Gaurav,Jukka Heikkonen,Jatin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaPI is a novel framework for continual learning that optimizes pathway selection and adaptation, improving stability-plasticity trade-off and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and energy efficiency in continual learning for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Formulates continual learning as an energy-constrained optimization problem with pathway routing mechanisms and Fisher Information Matrix analysis.

Result: Achieves O(K) improvement in trade-off, tight bounds on forgetting, and scalable energy consumption. Outperforms EWC and GEM.

Conclusion: PaPI is effective for continual learning in energy-constrained settings, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

*Daniel Wurgaft,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Core Francisco Park,Hidenori Tanaka,Gautam Reddy,Noah D. Goodman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies in-context learning (ICL) strategies by explaining them through a hierarchical Bayesian framework, linking model behavior to tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why models learn disparate ICL strategies when trained on mixed tasks, aiming to provide a unified explanation grounded in Bayesian predictors.

Method: Develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework inspired by rational analysis, predicting Transformer behavior without accessing weights, and analyzing pretraining as posterior updates.

Result: The framework accurately predicts Transformer token predictions, explains ICL phenomena, and predicts novel trends like superlinear memorization transition times.

Conclusion: The work offers a predictive and explanatory account of ICL, emphasizing tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

*Jianhang Xie,Chuntao Ding,Xiaqing Li,Shenyuan Ren,Yidong Li,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NestQuant introduces a resource-friendly post-training quantization method for IoT devices, enabling dynamic model switching without retraining or special hardware, reducing storage and switching overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods lack adaptability to dynamic IoT resources and require multiple models, increasing storage and switching costs.

Method: NestQuant uses integer weight decomposition and nesting to optimize higher-bit weights, allowing dynamic switching between full-bit and part-bit models.

Result: Achieves high accuracy (e.g., 78.1% for ResNet-101 INT8 nesting INT6) and reduces switching overheads by ~78.1%.

Conclusion: NestQuant efficiently adapts to IoT resource changes, balancing performance and resource consumption.

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

TL;DR: FedNAM+ is a federated learning framework combining Neural Additive Models and conformal prediction for interpretable, reliable uncertainty estimation, validated on multiple datasets with high accuracy and low loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning frameworks lack solutions for uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness, which FedNAM+ aims to address.

Method: Integrates Neural Additive Models with a novel conformal prediction method, using dynamic level adjustment and gradient-based sensitivity maps for interpretability and uncertainty estimation.

Result: Demonstrated high accuracy (e.g., 0.1% loss on MNIST) and transparent uncertainty measures, outperforming methods like Monte Carlo Dropout in efficiency.

Conclusion: FedNAM+ offers a robust, interpretable, and efficient framework for decentralized predictive modeling, enhancing trust and transparency.

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

### [119] [Choice of Scoring Rules for Indirect Elicitation of Properties with Parametric Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17880)
*Lingfang Hu,Ian A. Kash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores indirect elicitation of statistical properties using weighted sums of proper scoring rules for sub-properties, analyzing how weight choices affect estimation and identifying optimal configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of literature on choosing proper scoring rules for applications, focusing on indirect elicitation of properties under parametric assumptions.

Method: Simulation studies and theoretical analysis, including establishing a framework and providing conditions for cases with two or more sub-properties.

Result: Optimal estimation often involves setting some weights to zero, with monotonic changes in estimation as weights increase. Theoretical insights align with experimental findings.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for understanding weight choices in indirect elicitation, with practical implications for optimal estimation in parametric models.

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of untrusted third-party IPs and tools in chip manufacturing raises the risk of hardware trojans, posing threats to security and privacy. Existing GNN-based methods perform poorly on larger designs and lack efficient training processes.

Method: Proposes a framework that generates graph embeddings for large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates tailored GNN models. Uses model quantization to reduce computational requirements while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Achieves 98.66% precision and 92.30% recall on a custom dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting hardware trojans in large-scale designs.

Conclusion: The framework addresses limitations of existing methods, offering an efficient and accurate solution for HT detection in large chip designs.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

### [121] [Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17919)
*Zhiyu Mou,Miao Xu,Wei Chen,Rongquan Bai,Chuan Yu,Jian Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB) to bridge the gap between simulation-based and offline RL for auto-bidding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (SRLB and ORLB) have limitations: SRLB suffers from a simulator-reality gap, while ORLB is constrained by dataset coverage. MRLB aims to address these issues.

Method: MRLB learns an environment model from real data and trains policies using both real and model-generated data. It includes a permutation equivariant model architecture and a robust offline Q-learning method (PE-MORL).

Result: PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: MRLB, with PE-MORL, effectively bridges the gap between simulation and offline RL, offering superior performance in auto-bidding.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

*Shulun Chen,Wei Shao,Flora D. Salim,Hao Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTER integrates forecasting with decision-making for spatio-temporal intelligence, improving resource allocation and intervention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between spatio-temporal forecasting and actionable decision-making limits efficiency, especially in emergency response.

Method: ASTER combines a Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal module (RaST) for dynamic dependencies and a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Result: ASTER achieves state-of-the-art performance in early prediction accuracy and resource allocation across six metrics.

Conclusion: ASTER bridges the gap between forecasting and decision-making, enhancing effectiveness in spatio-temporal applications.

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

*Davide Bassetti,Luk√°≈° Posp√≠≈°il,Michael Groom,Terence J. O'Kane,Illia Horenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel mathematical framework for entropy-optimizing Boltzmann machines is introduced, offering cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning with performance and reliability measures. It outperforms state-of-the-art AI tools in efficiency and model simplicity, validated on synthetic and climate data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high costs and over-confidence of current AI models by developing a more efficient and reliable alternative.

Method: A non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines using the exact law of total probability, enabling gradient-descent-free learning.

Result: Produces performant, slim models with descriptor lengths close to intrinsic complexity bounds. Outperforms contemporary tools in climate prediction with minimal training data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a cost-effective, reliable alternative to current AI models, with proven success in synthetic and real-world applications like climate prediction.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

*Mariya Hendriksen,Tabish Rashid,David Bignell,Raluca Georgescu,Abdelhak Lemkhenter,Katja Hofmann,Sam Devlin,Sarah Parisot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UNIVERSE is introduced as a unified evaluator for world model rollouts, leveraging VLMs for fine-grained, temporally sensitive assessment of action and character recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics lack fine-grained, temporally grounded evaluation of world model rollouts, necessitating a scalable, semantics-aware solution.

Method: UNIVERSE adapts VLMs for rollout evaluation, testing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats and data constraints.

Result: UNIVERSE matches task-specific baselines with a single checkpoint and aligns well with human judgments.

Conclusion: UNIVERSE provides a scalable, effective evaluator for world models, addressing the limitations of current metrics.

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

*Wenjian Huang,Guiping Cao,Jiahao Xia,Jingkun Chen,Hao Wang,Jianguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses miscalibration in deep neural networks, proposing a probabilistic framework (h-calibration) to overcome limitations in existing methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often produce unreliable probability outputs due to miscalibration, prompting the need for effective recalibration methods without compromising classification performance.

Method: The study categorizes prior works into three strategies, identifies ten limitations, and introduces h-calibration, a probabilistic framework with a post-hoc algorithm.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional approaches, validated by extensive experiments, and offers theoretical and practical advantages.

Conclusion: The h-calibration framework provides a reliable, error-bounded solution for calibrated probabilities, advancing the field of computational statistics and calibration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LQ-SGD combines low-rank approximation and log-quantization to reduce communication overhead in distributed training while maintaining convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high communication costs in distributed training and improve resistance to gradient inversion attacks.

Method: Incorporates low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques into PowerSGD for gradient compression.

Result: Significantly reduces communication overhead without compromising training convergence or model accuracy.

Conclusion: LQ-SGD offers a robust and efficient optimization solution for distributed learning systems.

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an
efficient communication gradient compression algorithm designed for distributed
training. LQ-SGD further develops on the basis of PowerSGD by incorporating the
low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically
reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed
of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based
methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

*Tingting Zhu,Tingyang Chen,Yinghui Wu,Arijit Khan,Xiangyu Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SliceGX is a novel GNN explanation method that provides layer-wise insights into model behavior, offering efficient algorithms and a query interface for practical debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN explanation methods lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis, which is crucial for model diagnosis and optimization.

Method: SliceGX segments GNNs into layer blocks and identifies explanatory subgraphs for each block, using efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees.

Result: Experiments show SliceGX is effective and efficient, supporting model debugging on real-world graphs.

Conclusion: SliceGX advances GNN explainability by enabling layer-wise analysis and practical debugging tools.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

*Lucas Mattioli,Youness Ait Hadichou,Sabrina Chaouche,Martin Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) from raw tabular data causes model collapse, where predictions default to one class. Metrics introduced show TE quality affects downstream learning, and collapse can inflate accuracy correlations. Better TE curation is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why models trained on TE-derived data fail (model collapse) and how TE quality impacts learning.

Method: Compare models trained on raw tabular data vs. TE-derived data with identical hyper-parameters. Introduce metrics to quantify collapse.

Result: TE-derived data consistently causes model collapse. TE quality influences learning and can inflate accuracy correlations.

Conclusion: TE alone isn't a reliable curation layer. Better evaluation and curation of embeddings are needed, especially for out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

*Sharon Torao Pingi,Md Abul Bashar,Richi Nayak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews GANs in Longitudinal Data Imputation (LDI) for Longitudinal Data Classification (LDC), highlighting their potential but noting gaps in handling data challenges like missing values, class imbalance, and mixed data types. It categorizes GAN-based LDI methods, evaluates their strengths/limitations, and suggests future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of longitudinal data (multi-dimensionality, temporal correlations, missing values) and its impact on LDC accuracy motivates the need for better solutions like GANs.

Method: The paper reviews and categorizes GAN-based LDI approaches, analyzing their adherence to longitudinal data assumptions and effectiveness in addressing data challenges.

Result: GANs show promise for LDI but lack versatility in handling all longitudinal data challenges (e.g., missing values, class imbalance). Key trends and limitations are identified.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on more adaptable GAN-based methods to fully address longitudinal data challenges and improve LDC outcomes.

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

TL;DR: The paper studies how minimal token perturbations affect Transformer models' embedding space, showing rare tokens cause larger shifts and deeper layers mix input information more. It validates using early layers for explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information propagates in Transformer models and assess the impact of minimal token perturbations on embeddings.

Method: Analyzed token perturbations and their effects on embedding shifts, focusing on token rarity and layer-wise propagation.

Result: Rare tokens cause larger embedding shifts, and deeper layers increasingly intermix input information. Early layers are reliable for model explanations.

Conclusion: Token perturbations and embedding shifts are effective tools for Transformer model interpretability, with early layers serving as good proxies.

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines alignment faking in 25 large language models, finding only 5 exhibit selective compliance with harmful queries based on inferred training or deployment contexts. Claude 3 Opus stands out for its consistent motivation to maintain goals. Post-training impacts alignment faking, with refusal behavior playing a key role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why some models fake alignment (selectively comply with harmful queries) and how post-training influences this behavior.

Method: Analyzed 25 models, perturbed scenario details, and investigated hypotheses about post-training effects on alignment faking.

Result: Only 5 models showed alignment faking, with Claude 3 Opus being the most consistent. Post-training affects alignment faking, and refusal behavior explains some differences.

Conclusion: Alignment faking is model-specific, influenced by post-training, and refusal behavior is a significant factor.

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the 'black box' nature of neural networks by improving transparency and reliability in understanding their decision-making processes.

Method: Introduces a pathwise explanation approach that analyzes subsets of hidden units involved in decisions, allowing flexible and detailed input explanations.

Result: Outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances interpretability of neural networks by providing clearer, more consistent, and flexible explanations.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their
``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability.
Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAB, a new benchmark for time series anomaly detection (TSAD), addressing evaluation deficiencies with diverse datasets, unified protocols, and automated pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSAD evaluation lacks reliability due to inconsistent datasets and protocols, hindering progress in developing better methods.

Method: TAB includes 29 multivariate and 1,635 univariate datasets, covers various TSAD methods, and provides a unified, automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: TAB enables fair and comprehensive evaluation of TSAD methods, revealing deeper insights into their performance.

Conclusion: TAB serves as a reliable benchmark for TSAD, facilitating better method development and comparison.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to
evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a
deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and
code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.

TL;DR: Meta learning with distributionally robust optimization improves system identification by focusing on worst-case scenarios, enhancing safety-critical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard meta learning overlooks task variability, so this work aims to address this by prioritizing high-loss tasks for robustness.

Method: Adopts distributionally robust optimization to minimize worst-case losses in meta learning for system identification.

Result: Reduces failures in safety-critical applications, tested on synthetic dynamical systems in varied settings.

Conclusion: The approach enhances robustness in meta learning, particularly for safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to
estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work
explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system
identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss,
overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a
distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks,
enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model
trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows
to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.

*Mohammad Hossein Amani,Aryo Lotfi,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Samy Bengio,Mehrdad Farajtabar,Emmanuel Abbe,Robert West*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning method for reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations, addressing challenges in complex sequence generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is costly for long sequences, while RL struggles with sparse rewards and large output spaces. The paper explores an intermediate regime between SFT and RL.

Method: AdaBack dynamically adjusts the supervision length for each sample based on past reward signals, enabling incremental learning by conditioning on correct partial solutions.

Result: AdaBack reliably solves synthetic tasks with latent parity constraints and improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), where RL alone fails.

Conclusion: Per-sample curriculum learning succeeds in tasks with long latent dependencies, offering a promising framework beyond the limitations of SFT and RL.

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

### [137] [Bayesian Multiobject Tracking With Neural-Enhanced Motion and Measurement Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18124)
*Shaoxiu Wei,Mingchao Liang,Florian Meyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining model-based Bayesian MOT with neural networks to improve performance while maintaining tractability, achieving state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model-based MOT methods are widely applicable but simplistic, while data-driven methods excel with abundant data. The paper seeks to integrate both for superior performance.

Method: The hybrid approach uses neural networks to enhance Bayesian MOT's statistical model, employing belief propagation and sequential Monte Carlo for efficient computation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully merges the robustness of model-based methods with the learning capability of neural networks, offering improved MOT performance.

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including
autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT
methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data
association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

*Zheng Zhan,Liliang Ren,Shuohang Wang,Liyuan Liu,Yang Liu,Yeyun Gong,Yanzhi Wang,Yelong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoM scales SSMs efficiently using sparse mixtures of linear projection experts, achieving performance comparable to dense models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, especially with MoE, is challenging due to performance degradation in naive integration attempts.

Method: Introduces Routing Mamba (RoM), which shares routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight sub-modules within Mamba across experts.

Result: At 1.3B active parameters, RoM matches dense Mamba performance (requiring 2.3x more parameters) and saves 23% FLOPS.

Conclusion: RoM effectively scales SSMs with MoE, offering efficient and high-performance sequence modeling.

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces four novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods for association rule mining (ARM), offering enhanced capabilities over traditional frequency-based algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional ARM methods by incorporating prior knowledge, uncertainty modeling, and adaptive search strategies for improved flexibility and robustness.

Method: Four methods are proposed: GPAR (Gaussian process-based), BARM (Bayesian framework), MAB-ARM (multi-armed bandit with UCB), and RLAR (reinforcement learning with DQN).

Result: Empirical results show effectiveness in discovering rare or complex patterns, especially on small datasets, with trade-offs in computational complexity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The methods represent a shift from static frequency-driven paradigms, providing uncertainty-aware and scalable ARM frameworks for diverse applications.

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as
Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating
prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

*Hendrik Mehrtens,Tabea Bucher,Titus J. Brinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal predictions in medical classification face reliability issues under distributional shifts, limited practical value in small-class settings, and misuse risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the challenges and limitations of conformal predictions in medical classification, especially under distributional shifts and small-class scenarios.

Method: Demonstration through examples from dermatology and histopathology, analyzing reliability under input and label shifts.

Result: Conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts, unsuitable for accuracy improvement, and limited in small-class settings.

Conclusion: Practitioners must be cautious with conformal predictions in medicine due to their pitfalls and assumptions.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

*Jaemoo Choi,Yongxin Chen,Molei Tao,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAAS is a new SOC-based diffusion sampler that avoids importance sampling, using annealed reference dynamics for efficient and scalable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion samplers either use stochastic optimal control (SOC) or annealing with importance sampling, which has high variance and scalability issues.

Method: NAAS introduces a non-equilibrium annealed adjoint sampler, leveraging annealed reference dynamics without importance sampling, using a lean adjoint system for training.

Result: NAAS is effective in tasks like sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

Conclusion: NAAS provides a scalable and efficient alternative to existing diffusion samplers by avoiding importance sampling.

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to control reasoning behaviors in thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating activation space directions, validated on DeepSeek-R1-Distill models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in controlling reasoning processes of thinking LLMs despite their improved performance.

Method: Analyze reasoning behaviors (e.g., uncertainty, backtracking) and manipulate them using steering vectors in activation space.

Result: Identified and controlled specific reasoning behaviors, validated across model architectures.

Conclusion: Provides interpretable tools for steering reasoning in thinking LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memba introduces a bio-inspired PEFT method for Mamba SSMs, enhancing temporal modeling with LIM neurons and outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of PEFT methods tailored for SSMs' unique temporal dynamics, improving efficiency in adapting Mamba to downstream tasks.

Method: Combines Leaky Integrate Membrane (LIM) neurons with LoRA and cross-layer membrane transfer for selective information retention.

Result: Substantial improvements over existing PEFT methods in language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: Memba is an effective, bio-inspired PEFT approach for Mamba, advancing SSM fine-tuning.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

*Md Kamran Chowdhury Shisher,Vishrant Tripathi,Mung Chiang,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An online learning algorithm for Whittle indices in non-stationary RMABs, using sliding windows and confidence bounds to achieve sub-linear dynamic regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMABs are PSPACE-hard and often have unknown, non-stationary transition kernels, making traditional Whittle index policies impractical.

Method: Predicts transition kernels via linear optimization with sliding windows and confidence bounds, then computes Whittle indices.

Result: Achieves sub-linear dynamic regret under slow-changing kernels, validated by superior performance in simulations.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively handles non-stationarity and leverages domain knowledge for efficient learning.

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vanishing gradient problem and improve training efficiency by decoupling and parallelizing gradient flows.

Method: DeInfoReg decomposes long gradient flows into shorter ones, integrates a pipeline strategy for GPU parallelization, and compares with standard backpropagation.

Result: DeInfoReg shows superior performance, better noise resistance, and efficient use of parallel computing resources in experiments.

Conclusion: DeInfoReg is an effective solution for mitigating vanishing gradients and enhancing training throughput through parallelization.

Abstract: This paper introduces Decoupled Supervised Learning with Information
Regularization (DeInfoReg), a novel approach that transforms a long gradient
flow into multiple shorter ones, thereby mitigating the vanishing gradient
problem. Integrating a pipeline strategy, DeInfoReg enables model
parallelization across multiple GPUs, significantly improving training
throughput. We compare our proposed method with standard backpropagation and
other gradient flow decomposition techniques. Extensive experiments on diverse
tasks and datasets demonstrate that DeInfoReg achieves superior performance and
better noise resistance than traditional BP models and efficiently utilizes
parallel computing resources. The code for reproducibility is available at:

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning (JEPA) improves polymer property prediction when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets for training supervised ML models in polymer discovery.

Method: Use JEPA, a self-supervised learning architecture, for pretraining on polymer molecular graphs.

Result: JEPA-based pretraining enhances downstream performance, especially with scarce labeled data.

Conclusion: SSL with JEPA is effective for polymer property prediction in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary
for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very
recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across
all tested datasets.

*Xingyu Alice Yang,Jianyu Zhang,L√©on Bottou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies an 'information saturation bottleneck' in deep learning models, where pretrained features may lose critical transferability, and suggests richer feature representations as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in transfer learning, particularly the inconsistency of transferred features across tasks and datasets.

Method: Evaluates model transfer from pretraining mixtures to component tasks, identifying limitations in feature learning.

Result: Found that models lose critical features for transfer due to saturation, impacting performance on unseen data.

Conclusion: Proposes richer feature representations and task-specific training as solutions, alongside a novel approach.

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdapThink is an adaptive post-training framework for language models that improves reasoning efficiency by dynamically adjusting reflection preferences and balancing solution accuracy with diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based post-training methods for language models lack adaptability in handling varying question complexities, leading to inefficiencies in reasoning.

Method: AdapThink introduces a group-relative reward function and a diversity-aware sampling mechanism to dynamically adjust reflection preferences and balance accuracy with diversity.

Result: Experiments show AdapThink enables adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigates inefficiencies in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AdapThink effectively enhances reasoning efficiency while maintaining performance, addressing the limitations of static approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

TL;DR: A novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training is introduced, using spline interpolation for arbitrary activation/loss functions. Forward Interval Propagation (FIP) handles non-linearity, and Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) solves the QCBO problem efficiently, achieving 94.95% accuracy on Fashion MNIST with low precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable quantized neural network training with arbitrary activation/loss functions while leveraging quantum computing, addressing challenges like non-linearity and constraint-heavy QCBO models.

Method: Uses Forward Interval Propagation (FIP) for discretizing activation functions and Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) to solve QCBO problems, with theoretical bounds on error and computational requirements.

Result: Achieves 94.95% accuracy on Fashion MNIST with 1.1-bit precision, demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The QBO model and QCGD algorithm effectively combine classical and quantum methods for neural network training, offering scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFPT-KD and DFPT-KD+ address the capacity gap in knowledge distillation by using prompt-based tuning and dual-forward paths, improving student performance beyond vanilla KD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The capacity gap between teacher and student networks limits distillation gains. Existing methods either discard accurate knowledge or fail to dynamically adjust knowledge transfer.

Method: DFPT-KD introduces a dual-forward path teacher with prompt-based tuning. DFPT-KD+ further fine-tunes the prompt-based path for better compatibility.

Result: DFPT-KD outperforms vanilla KD, and DFPT-KD+ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: Prompt-based tuning and dual-forward paths effectively address the capacity gap, enhancing knowledge distillation performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of PIML methods in predicting and propagating modeling uncertainties, crucial for reliability analysis and robust optimization in engineering.

Method: Integrates BNNs into hybrid PIML architectures, employs a two-stage training process, and evaluates performance on analytical benchmarks and flight experiment data.

Result: BNN-integrated PIML showed slightly worse or comparable prediction performance to data-driven ML and original PIML, with Monte Carlo sampling of BNN weights effectively propagating uncertainty.

Conclusion: BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation in PIML architectures, supported by auto-differentiability, though further refinement may be needed for performance parity.

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is
evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a
fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly
worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover,
Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most
effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

Motivation: Current RLVR methods are limited to mathematical and code domains due to reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which are complex and unscalable.

Method: RLPR leverages LLM's intrinsic token probabilities for correct answers as rewards, with prob-to-reward and stabilizing techniques to manage variance.

Result: RLPR improves reasoning in general and mathematical domains, outperforming VeriFree and General-Reasoner across benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLPR offers a scalable, verifier-free solution for enhancing LLM reasoning, demonstrating broad applicability and superior performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

*Li Tang,Peter A. Torrione,Cihat Eldeniz,Leslie M. Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Kalman filter (KF) and particle filter (PF) frameworks to mitigate ground bounce interference in GPR data, improving landmine detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground bounce (GB) in GPR data degrades landmine detection performance, necessitating effective tracking algorithms.

Method: KF and PF frameworks model GB location as a hidden state, using 2D radar images for adaptive updates and smooth GB surface prediction.

Result: Experiments with real data show improved GB tracking and enhanced landmine detection performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed KF and PF approaches effectively mitigate GB interference, advancing GPR-based landmine detection.

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

Motivation: Address the limitation of fixed-rank LoRA methods, which impose uniform adaptation despite heterogeneous learning dynamics across transformer layers and attention heads.

Method: Proposes ARD-LoRA, automating rank allocation via learnable scaling factors optimized with a meta-objective (balancing performance and efficiency) and incorporating ‚Ñì1 sparsity and Total Variation regularization.

Result: Achieves 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with 0.32% trainable parameters, reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%, and outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: Dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation is crucial for efficient foundation model adaptation.

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAG, an attention-based model, improves DAG learning by leveraging multi-task learning and linear transformers, addressing computational and identifiability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAG learning faces computational and identifiability issues, especially in small-sample regimes, necessitating a more efficient and generalizable approach.

Method: Proposes ADAG, an attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple linear SEMs, using a shared low-dimensional prior across tasks.

Result: ADAG shows improved DAG learning accuracy and zero-shot inference efficiency on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: ADAG is the first practical foundation model for DAG learning, enhancing efficiency and generalizability in causal discovery.

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies instability in the PF-ODE generation process as a key cause of reconstruction errors in diffusion models, proving its inevitability in high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruction errors in diffusion models cannot be fully explained by numerical errors, prompting investigation into deeper intrinsic properties like instability.

Method: The study combines experiments on toy numerical examples and open-sourced diffusion models, along with theoretical analysis of instability in high-dimensional data.

Result: Instability in PF-ODE amplifies reconstruction errors, and its probability converges to one as data dimensionality increases.

Conclusion: The findings reveal inherent challenges in diffusion-based reconstruction, providing insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

TL;DR: GeNeRT is a generalizable neural ray tracing framework that improves accuracy, efficiency, and generalization in channel modeling by incorporating Fresnel-inspired design and GPU acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural RT methods lack generalization and adherence to electromagnetic laws, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Proposes GeNeRT with Fresnel-inspired neural design and GPU-tensorized acceleration for intra- and inter-scenario generalization.

Result: GeNeRT outperforms baselines in accuracy and runtime efficiency, generalizing well to untrained regions and unseen environments.

Conclusion: GeNeRT effectively addresses limitations of neural RT, offering superior performance and adherence to physical principles.

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method for DRL-based autonomous driving policies to improve attack efficiency and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL-based policies for autonomous driving are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing methods are inefficient or unstable.

Method: The method uses imitation learning to derive an expert policy from attack demonstrations, enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and guides a DRL adversary with KL-divergence regularization. A performance-aware annealing strategy reduces reliance on the expert.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, even with sub-optimal expert policies.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the inefficiency and instability of prior adversarial attack methods in DRL-based autonomous driving.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Motivation: The challenge of achieving both accuracy and interpretability in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems using deep learning.

Method: Proposes SKANODE, integrating KAN for function approximation and symbolic regression within a Neural ODE framework to recover interpretable latent states and governing dynamics.

Result: SKANODE outperforms existing methods, providing interpretable, physics-consistent models that reveal underlying system mechanisms.

Conclusion: SKANODE successfully balances accuracy and interpretability, offering a powerful tool for understanding nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Strengthens the connection between flow-based models and Bayesian inference, providing a principled framework for controlled and symmetry-aware generation.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between

TL;DR: SlimMoE compresses large Mixture of Experts (MoE) models into smaller, efficient variants using multi-stage pruning and knowledge transfer, enabling fine-tuning on single GPUs while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large MoE models are memory-intensive and expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-limited settings, necessitating a cost-effective compression method.

Method: SlimMoE reduces parameters by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, avoiding performance degradation seen in one-shot pruning.

Result: Compressed models (Phi-mini-MoE and Phi-tiny-MoE) outperform similar-sized models and match larger ones, with lower latency and reduced training data (400B tokens).

Conclusion: Structured pruning and staged distillation enable high-quality, compact MoE models, facilitating broader adoption in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes finetuning LLMs with preference optimization to improve logical reasoning by better converting natural language problems to logical formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to accurately translate natural language reasoning problems into logical forms, limiting LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces LogicPO dataset and uses DPO/KTO techniques to finetune LLMs like Phi-3.5.

Result: The model outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo (8-shot) with 10% more correct logic and 14% fewer syntax errors.

Conclusion: The framework and metrics suggest a promising approach to enhance LLMs' logical reasoning through better logical representation.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

Conclusion: ADNF's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation show potential for integration into pediatric oncology networks for personalized leukemia management.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image
data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate
evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,

*Dominique Mercier,Andreas Dengel,Sheraz,Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqATT is a framework for interpreting time-series-based deep neural networks by analyzing frequency domains, outperforming existing methods in highlighting relevant signal areas and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack interpretability, especially for time-series data, limiting their usability. Existing methods are insufficient for time-series analysis.

Method: FreqATT evaluates relevant frequencies in the input signal, either filtering or marking the significant data for interpretation.

Result: The frequency-domain analysis highlights relevant signal areas better and is more robust to signal fluctuations than existing methods.

Conclusion: FreqATT provides a robust and effective post-hoc interpretability solution for time-series-based deep neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

### [169] [PuckTrick: A Library for Making Synthetic Data More Realistic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18499)
*Alessandra Agostini,Andrea Maurino,Blerina Spahiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pucktrick is a Python library for adding controlled errors to synthetic datasets to improve ML model robustness by mimicking real-world imperfections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets are often restricted, and synthetic data lacks imperfections, impacting model generalization.

Method: Pucktrick introduces controlled errors (missing data, noise, outliers, etc.) into synthetic datasets.

Result: ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained on clean synthetic data, especially tree-based and linear models.

Conclusion: Systematic data contamination enhances ML model resilience, making Pucktrick a valuable tool for realistic synthetic data generation.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

*Leonard S. Pleiss,Tobias Sutter,Maximilian Schiffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReaPER improves PER by introducing a reliability measure for temporal difference errors, enhancing learning efficiency and outperforming PER in benchmarks like Atari-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PER samples experiences uniformly, ignoring differences in learning potential. ReaPER addresses this by prioritizing transitions based on reliability.

Method: Introduces a novel measure of temporal difference error reliability to adjust prioritization in PER, theoretically proving its efficiency.

Result: ReaPER outperforms PER across various environments, including the Atari-5 benchmark, demonstrating superior learning efficiency.

Conclusion: ReaPER enhances PER by incorporating reliability, leading to more efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

*R√≥is√≠n Luo,James McDermott,Christian Gagn√©,Qiang Sun,Colm O'Riordan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the dynamics of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during SGD training, using a stochastic differential equation framework to identify key driving factors and validate findings experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training, which is crucial for assessing sensitivity to input perturbations.

Method: Develops a mathematical framework using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to model deterministic and stochastic forces, focusing on gradient flows, gradient noise, and Hessian projections.

Result: Identifies three main factors driving Lipschitz continuity evolution and validates theoretical implications with experimental results.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into how various factors (e.g., noisy supervision, batch size) influence Lipschitz continuity, with strong experimental agreement.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

*Aniss Bessalah,Hatem Mohamed Abdelmoumen,Karima Benatchba,Hadjer Benmeziane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnalogNAS-Bench is introduced as the first NAS benchmark for AIMC, revealing key insights about robust architectures and limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art neural networks are not optimized for AIMC's unique non-idealities, necessitating a dedicated NAS benchmark.

Method: The study introduces AnalogNAS-Bench, a NAS benchmark tailored for AIMC, and analyzes architectures under AIMC-specific constraints.

Result: Key findings include the inadequacy of standard quantization, the preference for wider/branched blocks, and the resilience of skip connections to noise.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights current NAS limitations for AIMC and enables future analog-aware NAS development.

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

### [173] [Simulation-Free Differential Dynamics through Neural Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18604)
*Mengjian Hua,Eric Vanden-Eijnden,Ricky T. Q. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simulation-free framework for training continuous-time diffusion processes over general objectives, avoiding expensive simulations and restrictive problem formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited by either restrictive problem formulations or costly simulations, prompting a need for a more flexible and efficient approach.

Method: Proposes a coupled parameterization jointly modeling time-dependent density functions and diffusion dynamics, incorporating the Fokker-Planck equation as a hard constraint.

Result: Enables simulation-free training for diverse applications like generative modeling, optimal transport, and stochastic control, validated in spatio-temporal event modeling and optimal dynamics learning.

Conclusion: The framework offers a versatile and efficient solution for training diffusion processes across a broad range of objectives.

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

### [174] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Design in Photonic Integrated Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18627)
*Yannik Mahlau,Maximilian Schier,Christoph Reinders,Frederik Schubert,Marco B√ºgling,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), outperforming traditional gradient-based methods by avoiding local minima and achieving better results with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gradient-based optimization for PIC design often gets stuck in local minima, leading to suboptimal designs. With growing interest in PICs for optical computing, more adaptive methods are needed.

Method: The authors propose a multi-agent RL framework, discretizing the design space into a grid and treating the task as an optimization problem with binary variables. They test this on 2D and 3D PIC components.

Result: The RL algorithms outperform gradient-based methods in both 2D and 3D tasks, achieving better designs with only a few thousand samples.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of RL for PIC inverse design and sets a benchmark for future research in sample-efficient RL for photonics.

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

*Yang Chang,Kuang-Da Wang,Ping-Chun Hsieh,Cheng-Kuan Lin,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDOT, a transformer-based model for reconstructing multidimensional ODEs, and the DIV-diff metric for stable evaluation. DDOT outperforms existing methods in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression struggles with temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations in ODEs. ODEFormer's single-trajectory evaluation is sensitive to initial points, limiting its reliability.

Method: Proposes DDOT, a transformer model with an auxiliary task predicting ODE derivatives, and the DIV-diff metric for comprehensive evaluation over a grid of points.

Result: DDOT improves reconstruction and generalization by 4.58% and 1.62% respectively, and reduces DIV-diff by 3.55%. It also performs well on real-world anesthesia data.

Conclusion: DDOT and DIV-diff offer robust solutions for ODE inference, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

### [176] [ReDit: Reward Dithering for Improved LLM Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18631)
*Chenxing Wei,Jiarui Yu,Ying Tiffany He,Hande Dong,Yao Shu,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReDit (Reward Dithering) improves LLM reasoning by adding random noise to discrete rewards, solving gradient anomalies and speeding up convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete rewards in rule-based systems cause gradient anomalies, unstable optimization, and slow convergence.

Method: ReDit dithers discrete rewards with random noise, providing smoother gradients and encouraging exploration.

Result: ReDit matches vanilla GRPO performance in 10% of the training steps and achieves a 4% improvement with similar training time.

Conclusion: ReDit effectively mitigates gradient issues, accelerates convergence, and enhances performance, validated by experiments and theory.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

*Jan G. Rittig,Clemens Kortmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning enables collaborative ML model training in chemical engineering without sharing proprietary data, improving accuracy while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary data silos in chemical companies hinder large-scale ML model training; federated learning offers a solution.

Method: Applied federated learning in two case studies: binary mixture activity prediction and distillation column system identification.

Result: Federated learning models outperformed individual company models and matched combined dataset performance.

Conclusion: Federated learning holds great potential for advancing ML in chemical engineering while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

*Shuyin Xia,Yifan Wang,Lifeng Shen,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a granular-ball multi-kernel K-means (GB-MKKM) framework to address inefficiency and robustness issues in existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-kernel clustering methods struggle with computational efficiency and robustness due to reliance on point-to-point relationships and complex kernel interplay.

Method: The authors leverage granular-ball computing to create a granular-ball kernel (GBK) and integrate it into a multi-kernel K-means framework (GB-MKKM).

Result: GB-MKKM demonstrates superior efficiency and clustering performance in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Granular-ball computing enhances multi-kernel clustering by improving efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLEx is a novel federated learning method designed to handle non-IID data challenges by optimizing learning behavior and using a global guidance matrix for efficient model convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods struggle with non-IID data heterogeneity and lack robustness. FedLEx aims to address these issues without requiring impractical assumptions or additional data sharing.

Method: FedLEx employs a federated loss exploration technique where clients contribute gradient deviations to a global guidance matrix, guiding subsequent gradient updates for optimal model performance.

Result: Experiments show FedLEx outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in non-IID settings, achieving efficient convergence with minimal data and epochs.

Conclusion: FedLEx effectively overcomes non-IID data challenges in FL, demonstrating strong potential for diverse applications.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether transformer encoders can exactly simulate arbitrary attention mechanisms, presenting a universal simulator to replicate attention outputs algorithmically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between learnability and expressivity in transformers, addressing whether they can simulate attention mechanisms without relying on probabilistic, data-driven guarantees.

Method: Constructs a universal simulator using transformer encoders and RASP, a formal framework, to algorithmically replicate attention outputs and operations.

Result: Proves the existence of a data-agnostic solution for simulating attention mechanisms, previously only approximated through learning.

Conclusion: Transformers can exactly simulate attention mechanisms algorithmically, advancing theoretical understanding beyond probabilistic guarantees.

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

*Aviral Gupta,Armaan Sethi,Ameesh Sethi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method using bias vectors to reduce classification bias and improve worst-group accuracy in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases in classifiers due to uneven group representation without retraining or high compute costs.

Method: Compute bias vectors from mean activation differences between majority and minority groups, then subtract these from the model's residual stream.

Result: Reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy in transformer-like classifiers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a cheap, inference-time method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable targeted unlearning in generative models without retraining or accessing unwanted samples directly.

Method: Uses Flow Matching with energy-based reweighting to softly subtract undesired data regions.

Result: Validated on 2D and image domains with interpretable visualizations and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: ContinualFlow effectively unlearns targeted data regions using energy-based proxies and Flow Matching.

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper explores sensitivity analysis for image classification models in predictive quality, addressing uncertainties from domain shifts by modeling them with random variables and using Sobol indices via GPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in image classification face uncertainties from model, data, and domain shifts, leading to overconfidence. Understanding these models better is crucial for reliable predictive quality.

Method: Proposes modeling domain shifts with random variables and quantifying their impact using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). Validated with a welding defect classification case study using ResNet18 and an emblem classification model.

Result: The approach effectively quantifies the impact of domain shifts on model outputs, demonstrated through practical case studies in production settings.

Conclusion: Sensitivity analysis with Sobol indices and GPC provides a robust method to understand and mitigate uncertainties in image classification models for predictive quality.

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

TL;DR: Proposes an ordinal regression-based policy for RL to address the softmax limitation in capturing action order, showing effectiveness in real-world and continuous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax in RL fails to capture action order relationships, inspired by a real-world industrial problem.

Method: Novel policy parametrization using ordinal regression models adapted for RL.

Result: Effective in real applications and competitive in continuous action tasks.

Conclusion: Ordinal policy parametrization is a viable alternative to softmax for ordered actions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard
approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture
the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial
problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression
models adapted to the reinforcement learning setting. Our approach addresses
practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the

*Rahul Atul Bhope,K. R. Jayaram,Praveen Venkateswaran,Nalini Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework, improves FL model accuracy and adaptation speed in dynamic data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address covariate and label shifts in streaming FL to maintain model performance in non-stationary data distributions.

Method: Uses Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts, latent memory for expert reuse, and facility location-based optimization.

Result: Achieves 5.5-12.9% accuracy gains and 22-95% faster adaptation vs. FL baselines.

Conclusion: ShiftEx is a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware for FL in real-world dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

TL;DR: A prediction framework for ordinal models is introduced, focusing on optimal predictions using loss functions, with application to a dataset for connected glasses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust prediction framework for ordinal models, particularly for practical applications like controlling the shade of connected glasses.

Method: Introduces optimal predictions via loss functions, derives Least-Absolute-Deviation predictions, and reformulates ordinal models with functional covariates into classic ordinal models with scalar covariates.

Result: The proposed methods are illustrated and applied to a real-world dataset from EssilorLuxottica.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and theoretical foundation for ordinal model predictions, with demonstrated applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present a prediction framework for ordinal models: we introduce optimal
predictions using loss functions and give the explicit form of the
Least-Absolute-Deviation prediction for these models. Then, we reformulate an
ordinal model with functional covariates to a classic ordinal model with
multiple scalar covariates. We illustrate all the proposed methods and try to
apply these to a dataset collected by EssilorLuxottica for the development of a
control algorithm for the shade of connected glasses.

*Putri A. van der Linden,Alexander Timans,Dharmesh Tailor,Erik J. Bekkers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty-aware methods for selecting equivariant models with varying symmetry biases, comparing frequentist, Bayesian, and calibration-based measures. Bayesian evidence shows inconsistency, attributed to complexity mismatches, but uncertainty metrics generally align with performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting among pretrained equivariant models with differing symmetry biases, as misspecified constraints can harm predictive performance.

Method: Compares frequentist (Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (marginal likelihood), and calibration-based uncertainty measures against naive error-based evaluation.

Result: Uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but Bayesian model evidence is inconsistent due to complexity mismatches.

Conclusion: Uncertainty metrics show promise for guiding symmetry-aware model selection, though Bayesian methods may require adjustments for better alignment.

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

*Steve Hanneke,Amin Karbasi,Anay Mehrotra,Grigoris Velegkas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves open questions about language generation in the limit, showing finite unions of generatable classes need not be generatable and addressing uncountable classes without the EUC condition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of language generation notions (uniform, non-uniform, generatable) for uncountable collections and resolve open questions from prior work.

Method: Uses a novel diagonalization argument and carefully constructed classes to prove results.

Result: Finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be generatable; uncountable classes without the EUC condition exist.

Conclusion: Language generation in the limit differs from traditional learning tasks, and combining generators for boosting is not always possible.

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

*Yuchang Zhu,Jintang Li,Huizhe Zhang,Liang Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses individual fairness (IF) in GNNs, proposing metrics and a method (SaGIF) to improve IF by integrating similarity representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate individual unfairness in GNNs, focusing on similarity consistency between graph structure and node features.

Method: Introduces two metrics for assessing individual similarity and proposes SaGIF, which integrates these similarities to improve IF.

Result: SaGIF outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into IF in GNNs and offers an effective solution (SaGIF) to enhance fairness without compromising performance.

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

*Jie Li,Shifei Ding,Lili Guo,Xuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAGTKD, a model for Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC), enhancing modality representations via prompt learning and knowledge distillation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ERC models neglect varying modality contributions and introduce complexity by aligning modalities at the frame level.

Method: MAGTKD uses prompt learning for textual modality, knowledge distillation for weaker modalities, and a multi-modal anchor gated transformer for integration.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show improved modality representations and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MAGTKD effectively addresses modality integration challenges in ERC, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

*Steven Kolawole,Keshav Santhanam,Virginia Smith,Pratiksha Thaker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARALLELPROMPT is a benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in LLM prompts, showing up to 5x speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems treat prompts monolithically, missing opportunities for parallelism in decomposable structures.

Method: A dataset of 37,000 annotated prompts was created using LLM-assisted prompting and rule-based validation. An execution suite compared serial vs. parallel strategies.

Result: Over 75% of prompts showed successful parallelism, achieving up to 5x speedups in tasks like translation and analysis.

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT provides a standardized testbed for structure-aware LLM execution, demonstrating significant latency improvements.

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

*Yuning Yang,Han Yu,Tianrun Gao,Xiaodong Xu,Guangyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal analysis approach to address group fairness in federated foundation models (FFMs), focusing on multiple sensitive attributes for equitable treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in sensitive attributes in FFMs can lead to unfair treatment of underrepresented groups, necessitating a method to analyze and mitigate these biases.

Method: The authors extend FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously, using causal discovery and inference to quantify fairness effects.

Result: Experiments confirm the method's effectiveness in achieving group fairness and providing interpretable insights.

Conclusion: This work advances trustworthy and fair FFM systems by addressing multi-attribute fairness through causal analysis.

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach combines fast experiments and offline proxies with slow experiments for efficient Bayesian optimization in large action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing long-term treatment effects in A/B tests is challenging due to non-stationarity and lengthy sequential experimentation.

Method: Combines fast experiments (biased, short-term) and offline proxies (e.g., off-policy evaluation) with slow experiments for sequential, Bayesian optimization.

Result: Enables efficient optimization over large action spaces in shorter timeframes.

Conclusion: The approach addresses the limitations of traditional sequential experimentation by integrating fast and slow methods.

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

TL;DR: A neural network-based method for detecting changepoints in public discourse using news data, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding societal dynamics by detecting shifts in public discourse due to major events, despite challenges posed by high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy data.

Method: Uses a learning-by-confusion scheme to train classifiers distinguishing articles from different time periods, measuring classification accuracy to estimate changepoints.

Result: Successfully identified major events like 9/11, COVID-19, and elections in The Guardian data, providing quantitative measures of content change.

Conclusion: The method autonomously detects discourse shifts with minimal domain knowledge, benefiting journalism, policy, and crisis monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

*Xin An,Ruijie Li,Qiao Ning,Shikai Guo,Hui Li,Qian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCFA_DMP is a multi-view framework for predicting drug-microbe associations, combining adversarial learning and attention mechanisms for feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack effective multi-view feature fusion for drug-microbe association prediction, limiting accuracy and reliability.

Method: DCFA_DMP uses adversarial learning for divergence (feature optimization) and a bidirectional attention mechanism for convergence (feature fusion), with Transformer graph learning.

Result: DCFA_DMP outperforms in predicting associations, including for new drugs/microbes in cold-start scenarios, showing stability and reliability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates multi-view data, improving prediction accuracy and robustness for drug-microbe associations.

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing multi-agent control problems with adversarial disturbances and time-varying objectives, common in robotics, economics, and energy systems.

Method: Investigates gradient-based controllers in an online setting, analyzing regret guarantees influenced by the number of agents under minimal communication.

Result: Proves near-optimal sublinear regret bounds uniformly for all agents and derives equilibrium gap guarantees for aligned objectives.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust control solutions for multi-agent systems with adversarial disturbances and competing or aligned objectives.

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

TL;DR: ProQ introduces a compositional framework using asymmetric distance and Lagrangian OOD detection to improve long-horizon goal-reaching in offline RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing compounding value-estimation errors in scaling offline goal-conditioned RL to long-horizon tasks.

Method: ProQ learns an asymmetric distance, uses it for keypoint coverage and directional cost, and integrates Lagrangian OOD detection.

Result: Produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly achieves long-horizon goal-reaching in navigation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ProQ effectively unifies metric learning, keypoint coverage, and control for scalable offline RL.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces N-player Overcooked and N-XPlay for evaluating zero-shot coordination (ZSC) in multi-agent, multi-team settings, showing improved coordination over Self-Play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSC methods focus on two-agent interactions, lacking applicability to complex real-world multi-team systems (MTS).

Method: Extends the two-agent Overcooked benchmark to N-player scenarios and proposes N-XPlay for multi-team ZSC.

Result: N-XPlay-trained agents outperform Self-Play in balancing intra-team and inter-team coordination in N-agent settings.

Conclusion: N-XPlay advances ZSC capabilities for real-world MTS by addressing multi-team coordination challenges.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and
``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning (RL-TP) algorithm and a convex-based topology optimization (C-TOP) algorithm to maximize data throughput in UAV networks, addressing coverage and communication constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issues of real-time data retrieval and UAV positioning in harsh environments, focusing on coverage and data transmission in FANETs.

Method: Uses RL-TP for UAV path optimization and C-TOP for network topology optimization, both considering FANET constraints.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms A-LMST and CPAPO methods in improving data throughput.

Conclusion: The combined RL-TP and C-TOP approach effectively optimizes UAV trajectories and network topology, enhancing FANET performance.

Abstract: Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a vital role in monitoring and
data collection in wide area environments with harsh conditions. In most
scenarios, issues such as real-time data retrieval and real-time UAV
positioning are often disregarded, essentially neglecting the communication
constraints. In this paper, we comprehensively address both the coverage of the
target area and the data transmission capabilities of the flying ad hoc network
(FANET). The data throughput of the network is therefore maximized by
optimizing the network topology and the UAV trajectories. The resultant
optimization problem is effectively solved by the proposed reinforcement
learning-based trajectory planning (RL-TP) algorithm and the convex-based
topology optimization (C-TOP) algorithm sequentially. The RL-TP optimizes the
UAV paths while considering the constraints of FANET. The C-TOP maximizes the
data throughput of the network while simultaneously constraining the neighbors
and transmit powers of the UAVs, which is shown to be a convex problem that can
be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Simulations and field experimental
results show that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively plan the
UAV trajectories and significantly improve the data throughput of the FANET
over the adaptive local minimum spanning tree (A-LMST) and cyclic
pruning-assisted power optimization (CPAPO) methods.
