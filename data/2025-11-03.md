TL;DR: LAFA integrates LLM-based analytics with federated analytics to enable privacy-preserving data analysis using natural language queries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM analytics frameworks lack privacy protection, while federated analytics requires structured queries instead of natural language input.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent architecture with coarse-grained query decomposition and fine-grained DAG mapping, plus an optimizer to merge operations.

Result: LAFA outperforms baseline methods with higher success rates and significant reduction in resource-intensive operations.

Conclusion: LAFA provides a practical foundation for privacy-preserving LLM-driven analytics supporting natural language in federated settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

### [2] [FinPos: A Position-Aware Trading Agent System for Real Financial Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27251)
*Bijia Liu,Ronghao Dang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: FinPos is a position-aware trading agent system using LLMs that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by managing continuous positions through dual decision agents and multi-timescale rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based trading agents focus on single-step tasks and lack continuous position management awareness, which doesn't reflect realistic market conditions.

Method: Developed FinPos system with dual decision agents to interpret market information professionally and employ multi-timescale rewards to balance short-term fluctuations against long-term trends.

Result: Extensive experiments show FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in position-aware trading tasks that closely mirror real market conditions.

Conclusion: LLM-centered agent systems have significant unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making, with position-aware approaches being crucial for realistic trading scenarios.

Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text
information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial
trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading
tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we
propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic
market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,
optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of
market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis
for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising
from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,
the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of
multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance
short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the
position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More
importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a
vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.
