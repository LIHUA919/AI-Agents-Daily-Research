While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying\nmechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time\nseries anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,\ni.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this\npaper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,\nCaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to\neffectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural\ncausal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle\nthe challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with\na novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a\nperiodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach.
