*Pepijn Cobben,Xuanqiang Angelo Huang,Thao Amelia Pham,Isabel Dahlgren,Terry Jingchen Zhang,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GT-HarmBench is a benchmark for evaluating multi-agent AI safety in realistic high-stakes scenarios based on game theory, revealing that current frontier models fail to act socially beneficial in 38% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety benchmarks focus too much on single-agent scenarios, leaving multi-agent risks like coordination failure and conflict poorly evaluated. As AI systems become more capable and deployed in multi-agent environments, there's a need to assess these risks systematically.

Method: Created GT-HarmBench with 2,009 high-stakes scenarios derived from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository, covering game-theoretic structures like Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt, and Chicken. Tested 15 frontier models, measured sensitivity to prompt framing/ordering, analyzed reasoning patterns, and tested game-theoretic interventions.

Result: Agents chose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. Game-theoretic interventions improved socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%, but substantial reliability gaps remain.

Conclusion: Current frontier AI models show significant reliability issues in multi-agent coordination scenarios. GT-HarmBench provides a standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments, highlighting the urgent need for improved multi-agent AI safety evaluation and intervention techniques.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are increasingly capable and deployed in high-stakes multi-agent environments. However, existing AI safety benchmarks largely evaluate single agents, leaving multi-agent risks such as coordination failure and conflict poorly understood. We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/causalNLP/gt-harmbench.

### [2] [A Theoretical Framework for Adaptive Utility-Weighted Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12356)
*Philip Waggoner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theoretical framework that reimagines benchmarking as a multilayer adaptive network connecting evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups, enabling human tradeoffs to be embedded into benchmark structure for more context-aware AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential real-world settings, traditional benchmarking practices (shared tasks, metrics, leaderboards) fail to capture the sociotechnical contexts and diverse stakeholder priorities that determine what constitutes meaningful or desirable model behavior.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework that conceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. It uses conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule to formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure, allowing benchmarks to evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability.

Result: The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building more context-aware evaluation protocols. It enables new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, opening a path toward more accountable and human-aligned AI evaluation.

Conclusion: This theoretical framework represents a significant advancement in AI evaluation methodology, moving beyond static benchmarking toward dynamic, stakeholder-informed assessment that better reflects the complex sociotechnical contexts in which AI systems operate.

Abstract: Benchmarking has long served as a foundational practice in machine learning and, increasingly, in modern AI systems such as large language models, where shared tasks, metrics, and leaderboards offer a common basis for measuring progress and comparing approaches. As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation.

### [3] [Evolving Beyond Snapshots: Harmonizing Structure and Sequence via Entity State Tuning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12389)
*Siyuan Li,Yunjia Wu,Yiyong Xiao,Pingyang Huang,Peize Li,Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Fangyi Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EST framework adds persistent entity states to temporal knowledge graph forecasting to address episodic amnesia and maintain long-term dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TKG forecasting methods are stateless - they recompute entity representations from limited query windows at each timestamp, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies.

Method: Entity State Tuning (EST) - an encoder-agnostic framework with persistent entity states via: 1) topology-aware state perceiver for entity-state priors, 2) unified temporal context module with pluggable sequence backbone, and 3) dual-track evolution mechanism for state updates.

Result: EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

Conclusion: EST addresses the stateless limitation of existing TKG forecasters by introducing persistent and continuously evolving entity states, enabling better long-term dependency modeling and superior forecasting performance.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) forecasting requires predicting future facts by jointly modeling structural dependencies within each snapshot and temporal evolution across snapshots. However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting. The code is published at https://github.com/yuanwuyuan9/Evolving-Beyond-Snapshots

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart manufacturing needs interfaces that can translate high-level human intents into machine-executable actions

Method: Fine-tune Mistral-7B-Instruct-V02 on domain-specific dataset to translate natural language intents into JSON requirement models, semantically map to Neo4j-based knowledge graph grounded in ISA-95 standard

Result: Achieves 89.33% exact match accuracy and 97.27% overall accuracy, significant improvements over zero-shot and 3-shot baselines

Conclusion: Lays foundation for scalable, explainable, and adaptive human-machine interaction in Manufacturing-as-a-Service ecosystems

Abstract: The increasing complexity of smart manufacturing environments demands interfaces that can translate high-level human intents into machine-executable actions. This paper presents a unified framework that integrates instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) with ontology-aligned Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable intent-driven interaction in Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystems. We fine-tune Mistral-7B-Instruct-V02 on a domain-specific dataset, enabling the translation of natural language intents into structured JSON requirement models. These models are semantically mapped to a Neo4j-based knowledge graph grounded in the ISA-95 standard, ensuring operational alignment with manufacturing processes, resources, and constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over zero-shot and 3-shots baselines, achieving 89.33\% exact match accuracy and 97.27\% overall accuracy.

*Lajanugen Logeswaran,Jaekyeom Kim,Sungryull Sohn,Creighton Glasscock,Honglak Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline for generating high-quality web agent training data using constraint-based trajectory evaluation, enabling use of partial successes to expand training data, validated on new BookingArena benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge in training web agents is obtaining high-quality training data, specifically evaluating trajectory quality to quantify progress toward task completion.

Method: Introduces a constraint-based evaluation framework for fine-grained assessment of task progress, enabling leveraging of partially successful trajectories to significantly expand usable training data.

Result: The distilled student model outperforms open-source approaches and matches/exceeds commercial systems on the new BookingArena benchmark (complex booking tasks across 20 websites), while being significantly smaller.

Conclusion: The work addresses efficient creation of diverse, realistic web interaction datasets and provides systematic evaluation methodology for complex structured web tasks.

Abstract: We present a scalable pipeline for automatically generating high-quality training data for web agents. In particular, a major challenge in identifying high-quality training instances is trajectory evaluation - quantifying how much progress was made towards task completion. We introduce a novel constraint-based evaluation framework that provides fine-grained assessment of progress towards task completion. This enables us to leverage partially successful trajectories, which significantly expands the amount of usable training data. We evaluate our method on a new benchmark we propose called BookingArena, which consists of complex booking tasks across 20 popular websites, and demonstrate that our distilled student model outperforms open-source approaches and matches or exceeds commercial systems, while being a significantly smaller model. Our work addresses the challenge of efficiently creating diverse, realistic web interaction datasets and provides a systematic evaluation methodology for complex structured web tasks.

### [6] [To Mix or To Merge: Toward Multi-Domain Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12566)
*Haoqing Wang,Xiang Long,Ziheng Li,Yilong Xu,Tingguang Li,Yehui Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares two training paradigms for multi-domain reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR): mixed multi-task RLVR vs separate RLVR followed by model merging, finding few interferences and synergistic effects across reasoning-intensive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art models use different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR (mixed multi-task vs separate training + merging), but lack detailed comparison and analysis of these approaches, leaving gaps in understanding their relative effectiveness and interactions across domains.

Method: The authors design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets across multiple high-level tasks (math, coding, science, instruction following). They analyze internal mechanisms through weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints.

Result: RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects. The analysis reveals mechanisms behind mutual gains through geometric, behavioral, and information-based perspectives.

Conclusion: The study provides systematic comparison of multi-domain RLVR paradigms, showing promising compatibility across domains with synergistic benefits for reasoning tasks. The findings offer insights for developing general multi-domain expert-level models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) plays a key role in stimulating the explicit reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We can achieve expert-level performance in some specific domains via RLVR, such as coding or math. When a general multi-domain expert-level model is required, we need to carefully consider the collaboration of RLVR across different domains. The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging. However, most of the works did not provide a detailed comparison and analysis about these paradigms. To this end, we choose multiple commonly used high-level tasks (e.g., math, coding, science, and instruction following) as our target domains and design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets. We find the RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects. Furthermore, we analyze the internal mechanisms of mutual gains from the perspectives of weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints. This project is named as M2RL that means Mixed multi-task training or separate training followed by model Merging for Reinforcement Learning, and the homepage is at https://github.com/mosAI25/M2RL

### [7] [Can I Have Your Order? Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Slot Filling Ordering in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12586)
*Joshua Ong Jun Leang,Yu Zhao,Mihaela Cătălina Stoian,Wenda Li,Shay B. Cohen,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: McDiffuSE improves plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models by using Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize slot infilling order, reducing output variance and boosting performance on mathematical and code reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models shows promise for mathematical and code reasoning, but performance is highly sensitive to slot infilling order, leading to substantial output variance.

Method: McDiffuSE formulates slot selection as decision making and optimizes infilling orders through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The framework uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders.

Result: Experiments show average improvements of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Analysis reveals McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering but requires non-sequential generation for maximum performance.

Conclusion: MCTS-based planning is an effective approach for enhancing generation quality in MDMs. Larger exploration constants, rather than increased simulations, are necessary to overcome model confidence biases and discover effective orderings.

Abstract: While plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) shows promise for mathematical and code reasoning, performance remains highly sensitive to slot infilling order, often yielding substantial output variance. We introduce McDiffuSE, a framework that formulates slot selection as decision making and optimises infilling orders through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance. We observe that larger exploration constants, rather than increased simulations, are necessary to overcome model confidence biases and discover effective orderings. These findings establish MCTS-based planning as an effective approach for enhancing generation quality in MDMs.

### [8] [GeoAgent: Learning to Geolocate Everywhere with Reinforced Geographic Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12617)
*Modi Jin,Yiming Zhang,Boyuan Sun,Dingwen Zhang,MingMing Cheng,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoAgent is a geolocation reasoning model that uses expert-annotated data and specialized geo-rewards to outperform existing methods while generating human-aligned reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RL-based geolocation methods rely on AI-generated chain-of-thought data and training strategies that conflict with geographic characteristics, leading to concerns about their effectiveness and interpretability.

Method: 1) Introduces GeoSeek dataset with CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players; 2) Proposes geo-similarity reward and consistency reward (assessed by consistency agent) that encourage convergence to correct geographic answers while ensuring reasoning integrity.

Result: GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and general VLLMs across multiple grains (granularities) while generating reasoning that closely aligns with human thinking patterns.

Conclusion: GeoAgent addresses limitations of previous geolocation methods by incorporating geographic expertise and specialized rewards, resulting in superior performance and human-aligned reasoning in geographic tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents GeoAgent, a model capable of reasoning closely with humans and deriving fine-grained address conclusions. Previous RL-based methods have achieved breakthroughs in performance and interpretability but still remain concerns because of their reliance on AI-generated chain-of-thought (CoT) data and training strategies, which conflict with geographic characteristics. To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process. Experimental results show that GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and a series of general VLLMs across multiple grains, while generating reasoning that closely aligns with humans.

### [9] [AI Agents for Inventory Control: Human-LLM-OR Complementarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12631)
*Jackie Baek,Yaopeng Fu,Will Ma,Tianyi Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can complement traditional operations research algorithms in inventory control, with human-AI teams achieving higher profits than either alone, and a substantial fraction of individuals benefiting from AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OR algorithms for inventory control rely on rigid assumptions and perform poorly when demand distributions shift or contextual information is unavailable. LLMs offer flexible reasoning and contextual understanding but their optimal integration with OR methods and human decision-makers remains unclear.

Method: 1. Created InventoryBench benchmark with 1,000+ inventory instances using synthetic and real-world demand data to test under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. 2. Compared OR algorithms, LLMs, and human performance. 3. Conducted controlled classroom experiment embedding LLM recommendations into human-in-the-loop decision pipelines. 4. Formalized individual-level complementarity effect with distribution-free lower bound on fraction of individuals benefiting from AI collaboration.

Result: 1. OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, showing complementarity. 2. Human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents alone, contrary to prior findings. 3. Substantial fraction of individuals benefit from AI collaboration as measured by the derived lower bound.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively complement traditional OR algorithms in inventory control, and human-AI collaboration yields performance improvements at both population and individual levels, with a formalized framework demonstrating substantial benefits for most decision-makers.

Abstract: Inventory control is a fundamental operations problem in which ordering decisions are traditionally guided by theoretically grounded operations research (OR) algorithms. However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.
  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.
  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.

### [10] [Think Fast and Slow: Step-Level Cognitive Depth Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12662)
*Ruihan Yang,Fanghua Ye,Xiang We,Ruoqing Zhao,Kang Luo,Xinbo Xu,Bo Zhao,Ruotian Ma,Shanyi Wang,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li,Deqing Yang,Linus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogRouter is a framework that trains LLM agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step of multi-turn tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency by selecting appropriate reasoning levels based on task demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents rely on fixed cognitive patterns - either always responding immediately or always engaging in deep reasoning. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks where cognitive demands vary significantly across different steps, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution.

Method: Based on ACT-R theory, CogRouter designs four hierarchical cognitive levels from instinctive responses to strategic planning. The framework uses a two-stage training approach: Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of resulting actions.

Result: Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. Using Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while using 62% fewer tokens.

Conclusion: CogRouter successfully addresses the inefficiency of fixed cognitive patterns in LLM agents by enabling dynamic adaptation of cognitive depth, resulting in both higher success rates and improved computational efficiency for multi-turn decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for multi-turn decision-making tasks. However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency. With Qwen2.5-7B, it reaches an 82.3% success rate, outperforming GPT-4o (+40.3%), OpenAI-o3 (+18.3%), and GRPO (+14.0%), while using 62% fewer tokens.

### [11] [Evaluating Robustness of Reasoning Models on Parameterized Logical Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12665)
*Naïm Es-sebbani,Esteban Marquer,Yakoub Salhi,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diagnostic 2-SAT benchmark with parameterized families isolates specific reasoning competencies and failure modes in LLMs, revealing brittleness under structural changes despite constant surface statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAT-style benchmarks for evaluating LLM reasoning conflate surface features (length, wording, clause order) with the structural phenomena that actually determine satisfiability, making it hard to isolate specific reasoning capabilities and failure modes.

Method: Introduces a diagnostic benchmark for 2-SAT built from parameterized families of structured 2-CNF formulas where satisfiability is characterized by the implication graph. Creates five generator types: (1) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (2) SAT instances with prescribed free variables to control solution multiplicity, (3) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (4) late bridge clauses coupling monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (5) symmetry/duplication variants testing abstraction under renaming and redundant structure.

Result: Evaluation shows that LLM-based reasoners exhibit sharp performance transitions under targeted structural interventions even when surface statistics are held fixed, revealing brittleness regimes that are invisible to aggregate SAT accuracy. Performance varies across decision accuracy and assignment validity, with robustness quantified under semantics-preserving perturbations like clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming.

Conclusion: The proposed diagnostic benchmark successfully isolates distinct reasoning competencies and failure modes in LLMs, exposing structural brittleness that standard SAT benchmarks miss. This provides a more precise tool for evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities beyond surface-level features.

Abstract: Logic provides a controlled testbed for evaluating LLM-based reasoners, yet standard SAT-style benchmarks often conflate surface difficulty (length, wording, clause order) with the structural phenomena that actually determine satisfiability. We introduce a diagnostic benchmark for 2-SAT built from parameterized families of structured 2--CNF formulas, where satisfiability is characterized by the implication graph and can be tuned along interpretable axes. Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming. Across models, we observe sharp performance transitions under targeted structural interventions even when surface statistics are held fixed, revealing brittleness regimes that are invisible to aggregate SAT accuracy.

TL;DR: SkillsBench is a benchmark for evaluating agent Skills - structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents. It finds curated Skills improve performance by 16.2pp on average, but effects vary widely across domains, while self-generated Skills provide no benefit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid adoption of Agent Skills to augment LLM agents, there's no standard way to measure whether they actually help improve agent performance. The paper aims to provide a systematic benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of these Skills.

Method: Created SkillsBench with 86 tasks across 11 domains, each paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Evaluated tasks under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. Tested 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories to measure performance differences.

Result: Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points, but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare). 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average. Focused Skills with 2-3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.

Conclusion: Skills can significantly boost LLM agent performance when properly curated, but models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. The benchmark reveals important patterns in Skill effectiveness, suggesting focused, curated Skills are valuable while comprehensive documentation is less effective.

Abstract: Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help.

Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming.

TL;DR: X-SYS: A reference architecture for interactive explanation systems that connects XAI interfaces with system capabilities through STAR quality attributes and five-component decomposition, implemented via SemanticLens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI research has produced technical methods but deployment as systems remains challenging. Interactive explanation systems require both suitable algorithms and system capabilities that maintain usability across repeated queries, evolving models/data, and governance constraints. Operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements.

Method: Introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems with four quality attributes (STAR: scalability, traceability, responsiveness, adaptability) and five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). Maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple UI evolution from backend computation. Implemented via SemanticLens system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models.

Result: X-SYS provides a reusable blueprint for interactive explanation systems. SemanticLens demonstrates contract-based service boundaries enabling independent evolution, offline/online separation ensuring responsiveness, and persistent state management supporting traceability. Shows how to support end-to-end design under operational constraints.

Conclusion: This work provides both a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems, guiding XAI researchers, developers, and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation interfaces with system capabilities to operationalize XAI as sustainable information systems.

Abstract: The explainable AI (XAI) research community has proposed numerous technical methods, yet deploying explainability as systems remains challenging: Interactive explanation systems require both suitable algorithms and system capabilities that maintain explanation usability across repeated queries, evolving models and data, and governance constraints. We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability. Together, this work provides a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems supporting end-to-end design under operational constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebClipper compresses web agent search trajectories via graph-based pruning to eliminate redundancy and reduce tool-call rounds by ~20% while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research web agents suffer from inefficient search patterns with long tool-call trajectories containing cyclic reasoning loops and unproductive exploration branches, making search efficiency underexplored.

Method: Model search process as a state graph, cast trajectory optimization as minimum-necessary DAG mining problem, prune trajectories to eliminate redundant steps while preserving essential reasoning, then continue training on refined trajectories.

Result: Reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy, and introduces F-AE Score metric to balance accuracy and efficiency. WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance.

Conclusion: WebClipper provides practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design through trajectory compression and continued training, evolving agents toward more efficient search patterns.

Abstract: Deep Research systems based on web agents have shown strong potential in solving complex information-seeking tasks, yet their search efficiency remains underexplored. We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design.

TL;DR: BrowseComp-V³ is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal browsing agents' deep search capabilities, featuring complex cross-modal multi-hop reasoning tasks with publicly accessible evidence, revealing significant gaps in current model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing are limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities needed for real-world autonomous agents.

Method: Created BrowseComp-V³ benchmark with 300 challenging questions spanning diverse domains, featuring deep multi-level cross-modal reasoning where evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within/across web pages. All evidence is publicly searchable. Introduces expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation for fine-grained analysis of reasoning behaviors. Proposed OmniSeeker framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on the benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. The results demonstrate a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.

Conclusion: The BrowseComp-V³ benchmark provides a more comprehensive and reproducible way to evaluate multimodal browsing agents, exposing significant limitations in current models' ability to perform complex cross-modal reasoning and deep search, highlighting the need for substantial improvements for real-world autonomous agent deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), equipped with increasingly advanced planning and tool-use capabilities, are evolving into autonomous agents capable of performing multimodal web browsing and deep search in open-world environments. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.

*Alfred Harwood,Jose Faustino,Alex Altair*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves that an optimal policy in a Controlled Markov Process reveals exactly n log m bits of information about the environment's transition dynamics, providing an information-theoretic lower bound on implicit world modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental relationship between optimal behavior and internal world representation in AI systems, quantifying how much information optimal policies contain about the environment.

Method: Analyze Controlled Markov Processes with n states and m actions, assume uniform prior over transition dynamics, and prove mutual information between environment and optimal deterministic policy is exactly n log m bits.

Result: For any non-constant reward function, an optimal deterministic policy provides exactly n log m bits of information about the environment's transition dynamics, establishing an information-theoretic lower bound.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental information requirement for optimal behavior - any optimal policy must encode at least n log m bits about the world, providing precise quantification of "implicit world modeling" necessary for optimality.

Abstract: An important question in the field of AI is the extent to which successful behaviour requires an internal representation of the world. In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the "implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.

### [17] [Consistency of Large Reasoning Models Under Multi-Turn Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13093)
*Yubo Li,Ramayya Krishnan,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning models show meaningful but incomplete adversarial robustness - they outperform instruction-tuned baselines but have distinct vulnerabilities, with misleading suggestions universally effective and confidence-based defenses failing due to reasoning-induced overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models achieve SOTA performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. The authors want to understand whether reasoning capabilities automatically confer adversarial robustness.

Method: Evaluated nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Used trajectory analysis to identify failure modes. Tested Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG) defense and compared random confidence embedding vs targeted extraction.

Result: Reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: reasoning models significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, but all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles. Misleading suggestions are universally effective while social pressure shows model-specific efficacy. Identified five failure modes: Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue, with first two accounting for 50% of failures. CARG defense fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces, and random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness, and confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models. The distinct vulnerability profiles and failure modes highlight the need for specialized robustness testing and defense mechanisms for reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models with reasoning capabilities achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.

*Emanuele De Angelis,Fabio Fioravanti,Maria Chiara Meo,Alberto Pettorossi,Maurizio Proietti,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Constrained ABA (CABA), extending Assumption-based Argumentation to handle constrained variables over infinite domains, overcoming the limitation of ground arguments in standard ABA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ABA frameworks are limited to ground (variable-free) arguments built from propositional atoms, which restricts their representational power and applicability. The authors aim to lift this restriction to handle more complex reasoning scenarios.

Method: Propose a novel notion of Constrained ABA (CABA) where framework components and arguments may include constrained variables ranging over possibly infinite domains. Define non-ground semantics for CABA based on various notions of non-ground attacks.

Result: Developed CABA framework with non-ground semantics that conservatively generalize standard ABA semantics, demonstrating that the new approach extends the capabilities of ABA while maintaining compatibility with existing theory.

Conclusion: CABA successfully overcomes the representational limitations of standard ABA by allowing constrained variables and non-ground arguments, providing a more expressive and applicable framework for structured argumentation while preserving the theoretical foundations of ABA.

Abstract: Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a well-established form of structured argumentation. ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains. We define non-ground semantics for CABA, in terms of various notions of non-ground attacks. We show that the new semantics conservatively generalise standard ABA semantics.

### [19] [Optimal Take-off under Fuzzy Clearances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13166)
*Hugo Henry,Arthur Tsai,Kelly Cohen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid obstacle avoidance for drones combines optimal control with fuzzy logic to adapt constraints based on aviation regulations, enabling selective obstacle avoidance updates while reducing unnecessary recomputations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical optimal control has limitations under uncertainty, and there's a need for interpretable decision making in safety-critical aviation systems.

Method: Uses a three-stage Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy layer to modulate constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on FAA/EASA regulations, then incorporates these as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved with FALCON toolbox and IPOPT.

Result: Proof-of-concept implementation shows computation times of 2-3 seconds per iteration, suggesting feasibility for near real-time applications, but reveals a critical software incompatibility where the Lagrangian penalty term remained zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach shows promise for adaptive constraint handling in unmanned aircraft, but critical solver compatibility issues must be addressed before practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid obstacle avoidance architecture that integrates Optimal Control under clearance with a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS) to enable adaptive constraint handling for unmanned aircraft. Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.

### [20] [OptiML: An End-to-End Framework for Program Synthesis and CUDA Kernel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12305)
*Arijit Bhattacharjee,Heng Ping,Son Vu Le,Paul Bogdan,Nesreen K. Ahmed,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiML is an end-to-end framework that optimizes CUDA kernels through two decoupled stages: generating initial implementations from natural language, then refining them using Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by hardware-aware rewards and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating high-performance CUDA kernels is challenging due to combinatorial optimization spaces and noisy/expensive hardware feedback. While LLMs can synthesize functionally correct code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices.

Method: OptiML uses two-stage approach: 1) OptiML-G generates initial executable programs from natural language using Mixture-of-Thoughts as proposal policy, 2) OptiML-X refines kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, with hardware-aware rewards from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified with Nsight Compute, and evaluated using composite objective combining runtime, hardware bottleneck proxies, and guardrails.

Result: OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings across diverse CUDA kernels, producing interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.

Conclusion: OptiML effectively bridges the gap between functional correctness and high performance in CUDA kernel generation by combining LLM-based synthesis with systematic search under verification, demonstrating a robust approach to navigating the complex optimization space of GPU programming.

Abstract: Generating high-performance CUDA kernels remains challenging due to the need to navigate a combinatorial space of low-level transformations under noisy and expensive hardware feedback. Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.

### [21] [Abstractive Red-Teaming of Language Model Character](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12318)
*Nate Rahn,Allison Qi,Avery Griffin,Jonathan Michala,Henry Sleight,Erik Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "abstractive red-teaming" to find query categories that cause language models to violate character specifications, using efficient algorithms to identify problematic query patterns without deployment-scale compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language model assistants need to conform to character specifications, but can violate them in large-scale deployments. Current methods require deployment-level compute to find violations, which is expensive. The authors aim to identify query types that produce character violations using much less compute.

Method: Introduces abstractive red-teaming: searching for natural-language query categories (e.g., "queries in Chinese about family roles") that systematically elicit violations. Presents two algorithms: 1) reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and 2) using a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Both operate against a character-trait-specific reward model.

Result: The algorithms outperform baselines across 12-principle character specifications and 7 target models. Generated interesting categories: queries asking Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future led to responses about AI dominating humanity; queries asking GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items led to illegal weapons recommendations.

Conclusion: Abstractive red-teaming represents an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character, enabling efficient identification of query categories that cause character violations without requiring massive deployment-scale compute.

Abstract: We want language model assistants to conform to a character specification, which asserts how the model should act across diverse user interactions. While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. "The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles," that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons. Overall, we believe our results represent an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character.

### [22] [The Appeal and Reality of Recycling LoRAs with Adaptive Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12323)
*Haokun Liu,Gyung Hyun Je,Marco Ciccone,Zhenlin Xu,Prasanth YSS,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive merging of recycled LoRAs from model repositories offers limited benefits over training a new LoRA, with performance gains likely due to regularization rather than cross-task transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in recycling user-contributed LoRAs from public repositories like Hugging Face Hub, despite widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules. It investigates whether adaptive merging methods can effectively leverage these recycled LoRAs to improve performance.

Method: The research employs an empirical study using nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct. It evaluates various adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods, including a new method developed through extensive search over the methodological design space. Performance is compared against training new LoRAs on the same data used for merging.

Result: Adaptive merging methods show limited benefits over training a new LoRA on the same data. The specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, and even using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameters yields similar performance, suggesting gains come from regularization rather than cross-task transfer. Positive transfer only occurs when highly relevant LoRAs are available in the pool.

Conclusion: The primary benefit of adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs appears to be regularization rather than enabling cross-task transfer. The findings challenge assumptions about LoRA recycling effectiveness and suggest that when highly relevant LoRAs are unavailable, adaptive merging offers minimal advantages over training new LoRAs.

Abstract: The widespread availability of fine-tuned LoRA modules for open pre-trained models has led to an interest in methods that can adaptively merge LoRAs to improve performance. These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found "in the wild" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online.

*Farshad Zeinali,Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi,Dusit Niyato,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid reinforcement learning framework combining DQN and DDPG for joint tokenizer agreement, sub-channel assignment, and beamforming in multi-user wireless TokenCom systems improves semantic quality and reduces video freezing by 68% compared to conventional schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TokenCom requires transmitters and receivers to agree on identical tokenizer models and codebooks to establish a shared semantic latent space. The Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process needs to be optimized in multi-user wireless environments to enable efficient digital semantic- and goal-oriented communications in future networks.

Method: Proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming optimization. This addresses the mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem in multi-antenna base station downlink video transmission.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in semantic quality and resource efficiency. It reduces video transmission freezing events by 68% compared to conventional H.265-based schemes.

Conclusion: The hybrid RL approach effectively solves the joint optimization problem in multi-user wireless TokenCom, demonstrating significant performance improvements in semantic communication quality and reliability while reducing video transmission disruptions.

Abstract: Token Communications (TokenCom) has recently emerged as an effective new paradigm, where tokens are the unified units of multimodal communications and computations, enabling efficient digital semantic- and goal-oriented communications in future wireless networks. To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in terms of semantic quality and resource efficiency, while reducing the freezing events in video transmission by 68% compared to the conventional H.265-based scheme.

TL;DR: ΔBelief-RL trains agents to navigate uncertainty by rewarding changes in their belief about reaching target solutions, improving information-seeking and outperforming outcome-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training agents to navigate uncertainty over long horizons, where credit assignment is difficult due to delayed rewards and sparse feedback.

Method: Leverages a language model's intrinsic beliefs to reward intermediate progress by measuring the change in probability the agent assigns to the target solution (ΔBelief). Trains on synthetic interaction data to teach information-seeking capabilities.

Result: Outperforms purely outcome-based rewards, with improvements generalizing to out-of-distribution applications (customer service, personalization). Performance improves as test-time interactions scale beyond training horizon, with increasing interaction-efficiency on Pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: Introduces a scalable training strategy for long-horizon uncertainty navigation by enabling credit assignment to intermediate actions through intrinsic ΔBelief rewards.

Abstract: How can we train agents to navigate uncertainty over long horizons? In this work, we propose ΔBelief-RL, which leverages a language model's own intrinsic beliefs to reward intermediate progress. Our method utilizes the change in the probability an agent assigns to the target solution for credit assignment. By training on synthetic interaction data, ΔBelief-RL teaches information-seeking capabilities that consistently outperform purely outcome-based rewards for Reinforcement Learning, with improvements generalizing to out-of-distribution applications ranging from customer service to personalization. Notably, the performance continues to improve as we scale test-time interactions beyond the training horizon, with interaction-efficiency increasing even on Pass@k metrics. Overall, our work introduces a scalable training strategy for navigating uncertainty over a long-horizon, by enabling credit assignment to intermediate actions via intrinsic ΔBelief rewards.

*Gianfranco Cortés,Maria Esteban-Casadevall,Yueqing Feng,Jonas Henkel,Edward Hirst,Tancredi Schettini Gherardini,Alexander G. Stapleton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network approach called Nirenberg Neural Network solves the Nirenberg problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on S² using physics-informed neural networks, achieving high accuracy for realizable curvatures and enabling classification of unknown cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Nirenberg problem in geometric analysis asks whether any smooth function on S² can be realized as the Gaussian curvature of a metric conformal to the round metric. This longstanding existence question lacks computational exploration tools.

Method: A mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly parametrizes the conformal factor globally. It uses a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation, with additional validation via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and spherical-harmonic expansions for interpretability.

Result: For prescribed curvatures with known realizability, the neural network achieves very low losses (10⁻⁷ - 10⁻¹⁰). For unrealizable curvatures, significantly higher losses are obtained. This allows assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realizable functions from non-realisable ones.

Conclusion: The Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrates that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions like the Nirenberg problem.

Abstract: This work introduces the Nirenberg Neural Network: a numerical approach to the Nirenberg problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on $S^2$ for metrics that are pointwise conformal to the round metric. Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.
  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones. The current capabilities of the Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrate that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions.

TL;DR: Proposes Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model for opioid policy evaluation that unifies forecasting, counterfactual reasoning, and policy optimization through a policy-conditioned Transformer framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opioid epidemic is a severe public health crisis where evaluating policy interventions before implementation is challenging due to complex interactions in dynamic systems. Traditional approaches may miss unintended consequences when targeting one risk pathway amplifies another.

Method: Introduces Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer. The model serves as a simulator for forecasting (forward pass), counterfactual analysis (substituting alternative policy encodings), and policy optimization (Monte Carlo Tree Search). Constructs a state-level monthly dataset (2019-2024) with opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy. Validates each architectural component and shows the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.

Conclusion: Policy4OOD provides a unified framework for opioid policy evaluation through world modeling, addressing three key challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold. The approach demonstrates practical value for data-driven public health decision-making.

Abstract: The opioid epidemic remains one of the most severe public health crises in the United States, yet evaluating policy interventions before implementation is difficult: multiple policies interact within a dynamic system where targeting one risk pathway may inadvertently amplify another. We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.

Abstract: The intersection of Mean Field Games (MFGs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has fostered a growing family of algorithms designed to solve large-scale multi-agent systems. However, the field currently lacks a standardized evaluation protocol, forcing researchers to rely on bespoke, isolated, and often simplistic environments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to assess the robustness, generalization, and failure modes of emerging methods. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization. Based on our extensive empirical results, we propose guidelines to standardize future experimental comparisons.

### [28] [Value Bonuses using Ensemble Errors for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12375)
*Abdul Wahab,Raksha Kumaraswamy,Martha White*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VBE (Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors) introduces an algorithm for exploration that uses ensemble prediction errors to create value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism, outperforming existing methods on classic exploration environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimistic value estimation methods only increase value bonuses retroactively after seeing higher rewards, failing to encourage first-time visits to state-action pairs. There's a need for exploration algorithms that provide effective first-visit optimism.

Method: VBE maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs) and uses prediction errors from these ensembles to design value bonuses. Key innovation: designs rewards for RQFs so value bonuses can decrease to zero, enabling first-visit optimism and deep exploration.

Result: VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic exploration environments. Demonstrates scalability to complex Atari environments.

Conclusion: VBE provides an effective approach for directed exploration by leveraging ensemble prediction errors to create value bonuses that support first-visit optimism and deep exploration in RL.

Abstract: Optimistic value estimates provide one mechanism for directed exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.

*Zhizun Wang,David Meger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-based multi-agent RL framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imagination, using learned embeddings to improve coordination in partially observable dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments requires both informative representations and data-efficient training. Existing methods struggle with these challenges simultaneously.

Method: Novel model-based multi-agent RL framework with state-action learned embeddings (SALE). Uses variational auto-encoders for world model training, injects SALE into both imagination module for future rollouts and joint agent network for action-value estimation via mixing network.

Result: Method demonstrates consistent gains over baseline algorithms on StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging benchmarks. Shows effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings in multi-agent model-based paradigm.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions by coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, giving agents richer understanding of how choices influence collective outcomes.

Abstract: Learning to coordinate many agents in partially observable and highly dynamic environments requires both informative representations and data-efficient training. To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.

*Wenxin Chen,Weishen Pan,Kyra Gan,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3-Net reduces error propagation in ICE-based longitudinal treatment effect estimation using SDR pseudo-outcomes during training and LTMLE for final debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal treatment effect estimation suffers from treatment-confounder feedback and error propagation in ICE G-computation, which corrupts learned outcome regression models.

Method: Uses Sequential Doubly Robust pseudo-outcomes during ICE training to interrupt error propagation, plus a multi-task Transformer with covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision and target network for stability. Final estimation uses LTMLE on original outcomes with learned nuisance models.

Result: D3-Net robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed D3-Net framework effectively mitigates error propagation in ICE training and provides robust, optimal finite-sample properties for longitudinal treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Estimating longitudinal treatment effects is essential for sequential decision-making but is challenging due to treatment-confounder feedback. While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.

### [31] [TRACE: Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution for Streaming Electronic Health Records (EHRs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12833)
*Zhan Qu,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRACE enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs using structured memory and agentic components, improving accuracy and safety over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with longitudinal patient trajectories due to evolving states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events. Existing fine-tuning or retrieval methods have computational overhead, privacy issues, and instability with long contexts.

Method: TRACE uses a dual-memory architecture (Global Protocol and Individual Protocol) with four agentic components (Router, Reasoner, Auditor, Steward) to structure and maintain context without extending context windows or updating parameters. It uses structured state compression for bounded inference costs.

Result: Evaluated on MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: TRACE provides an effective framework for temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs that addresses limitations of existing approaches while maintaining interpretability and safety auditing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.

### [32] [TFT-ACB-XML: Decision-Level Integration of Customized Temporal Fusion Transformer and Attention-BiLSTM with XGBoost Meta-Learner for BTC Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12380)
*Raiz Ud Din,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid TFT-ACB-XML framework combines TFT and BiLSTM with attention for BTC price prediction, using XGBoost as meta-learner and error-reciprocal weighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin forecasting is challenging due to non-linear, volatile, and temporally irregular decentralized markets, and existing deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization across diverse conditions.

Method: Hybrid stacked-generalization framework with two parallel base learners: customized TFT (handles long-range dependencies) and Attention-Customized BiLSTM (captures short-term dependencies), with predictions weighted via error-reciprocal strategy, then fed to XGBoost regressor as meta-learner.

Result: The framework achieves MAPE of 0.65%, MAE of 198.15, and RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample prediction under walk-forward evaluation, demonstrating improved performance over baseline models during volatile periods including 2024 halving and spot ETFs.

Conclusion: The TFT-ACB-XML framework effectively addresses BTC forecasting challenges by combining interpretable attention mechanisms with stacked generalization, showing robustness during major market events.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of Bitcoin (BTC) has always been a challenge because decentralized markets are non-linear, highly volatile, and have temporal irregularities. Existing deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and generalization across diverse market conditions. This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block. The evaluation period spans the 2024 BTC halving and the spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds) period, which coincide with major liquidity and volatility shifts.

### [33] [Why Deep Jacobian Spectra Separate: Depth-Induced Scaling and Singular-Vector Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12384)
*Nathanaël Haas,Francçois Gatine,Augustin M Cosse,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that deep neural networks exhibit exponential scaling of singular values and spectral separation in their Jacobians, leading to effectively decoupled singular-value dynamics that explain implicit bias without requiring balanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding implicit bias in gradient-based training of deep networks is challenging because tractable analyses typically only exist for balanced deep linear models. The paper aims to find alternative, theoretically grounded signatures that explain implicit bias in more general settings.

Method: The authors adopt a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, treating Jacobians as products of masked linear maps within activation regions. They prove existence of Lyapunov exponents for top singular values, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. They further show strong spectral separation forces singular-vector alignment.

Result: Theoretical results show depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation in deep Jacobians. Experiments validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting that emergent low-rank Jacobian structure drives implicit bias.

Conclusion: The paper provides a mechanistic account of implicit bias in deep networks through two key signatures: exponential singular-value scaling and spectral separation in Jacobians, which enable effectively decoupled dynamics similar to balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing constraints.

Abstract: Understanding why gradient-based training in deep networks exhibits strong implicit bias remains challenging, in part because tractable singular-value dynamics are typically available only for balanced deep linear models. We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias.

### [34] [Rational Neural Networks have Expressivity Advantages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12390)
*Maosen Tang,Alex Townsend*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rational activation functions outperform standard fixed activations like ReLU and sigmoid, achieving better expressivity with exponentially fewer parameters while maintaining practical training compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural network activations (piecewise-linear and smooth functions) have limitations in expressivity and parameter efficiency. The authors want to demonstrate that trainable low-degree rational activation functions can overcome these limitations and provide superior approximation capabilities.

Method: The authors study neural networks with trainable low-degree rational activation functions. They establish approximation-theoretic separations by comparing rational-activation networks to networks using standard fixed activations. They prove theoretical results about parameter efficiency and conduct practical experiments where rational activations are integrated into standard architectures and training pipelines.

Result: Theoretical results show that rational-activation networks can approximate standard networks with only poly(log log(1/ε)) overhead in size, while the converse requires Ω(log(1/ε)) parameters - an exponential gap. In practice, rational activations match or outperform fixed activations under identical architectures and optimizers, integrating seamlessly into standard training pipelines.

Conclusion: Trainable low-degree rational activation functions are more expressive and parameter-efficient than standard fixed activations, offering both theoretical advantages (exponential parameter efficiency gap) and practical benefits (easy integration and competitive or superior performance).

Abstract: We study neural networks with trainable low-degree rational activation functions and show that they are more expressive and parameter-efficient than modern piecewise-linear and smooth activations such as ELU, LeakyReLU, LogSigmoid, PReLU, ReLU, SELU, CELU, Sigmoid, SiLU, Mish, Softplus, Tanh, Softmin, Softmax, and LogSoftmax. For an error target of $\varepsilon>0$, we establish approximation-theoretic separations: Any network built from standard fixed activations can be uniformly approximated on compact domains by a rational-activation network with only $\mathrm{poly}(\log\log(1/\varepsilon))$ overhead in size, while the converse provably requires $Ω(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ parameters in the worst case. This exponential gap persists at the level of full networks and extends to gated activations and transformer-style nonlinearities. In practice, rational activations integrate seamlessly into standard architectures and training pipelines, allowing rationals to match or outperform fixed activations under identical architectures and optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRLSE is an algorithm for high-dimensional level set estimation that uses dual acquisition functions for global and local exploration to improve sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Level set estimation in high-dimensional spaces is challenging due to exponential growth in search volume, requiring efficient active learning methods.

Method: TRLSE identifies and refines regions near the threshold boundary using dual acquisition functions operating at global and local levels.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows TRLSE's accuracy, and evaluations on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate superior sample efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: TRLSE effectively addresses high-dimensional LSE challenges, offering a robust and efficient solution with proven performance gains.

Abstract: Level set estimation (LSE) classifies whether an unknown function's value exceeds a specified threshold for given inputs, a fundamental problem in many real-world applications. In active learning settings with limited initial data, we aim to iteratively acquire informative points to construct an accurate classifier for this task. In high-dimensional spaces, this becomes challenging where the search volume grows exponentially with increasing dimensionality. We propose TRLSE, an algorithm for high-dimensional LSE, which identifies and refines regions near the threshold boundary with dual acquisition functions operating at both global and local levels. We provide a theoretical analysis of TRLSE's accuracy and show its superior sample efficiency against existing methods through extensive evaluations on multiple synthetic and real-world LSE problems.

*Yuchen Ma,Yue Huang,Wenjie Wang,Xiaonan Luo,Xiangliang Zhang,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PersonaGym generates synthetic personalized interaction data and PPOpt optimizes prompts based on inferred user profiles using a reason-then-optimize approach with outcome-driven RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods focus on task-level optimization but overlook user-specific preferences and constraints due to lack of personalized interaction data and robust reward signals.

Method: 1) PersonaGym: Agentic LLM system to generate realistic synthetic multi-turn interaction trajectories with dynamic preferences and noise patterns. 2) PPOpt: Scalable framework with reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers explicit user profiles from interaction histories and conditions prompt rewriting on them using supervised prior + multi-objective RL.

Result: PersonaAtlas dataset provides large-scale, high-quality synthetic personalized interactions. PPOpt consistently outperforms SOTA baselines in task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy/sparse preference signals.

Conclusion: The proposed PersonaGym data generation framework and PPOpt optimization method effectively address the gap in personalized prompt optimization by creating realistic synthetic data and enabling scalable, profile-aware prompt adaptation without model modification.

Abstract: Personalized prompting offers large opportunities for deploying large language models (LLMs) to diverse users, yet existing prompt optimization methods primarily focus on task-level optimization while largely overlooking user-specific preferences and latent constraints of individual users. This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy as well as to sparse preference signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AstRL: A deep reinforcement learning framework that treats circuit design as a graph generation problem to automatically synthesize analog and mixed-signal circuits at transistor-level, achieving expert-aligned performance with high structural correctness and functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite increasing complexity in analog and mixed-signal (AMS) IC design, automation advancements remain limited due to the challenge of creating generalized optimization methods that work across diverse, constrained, and non-differentiable circuit design spaces.

Method: Casts circuit design as a graph generation problem using deep reinforcement learning (AstRL) with policy-gradient approach. Uses simulator-embedded environment for ground-truth feedback during training, behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards for expert-aligned generation, and operates at individual transistor level for fine-grained topology generation with inductive biases in action space.

Result: Experimental results for three realistic design tasks show substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality.

Conclusion: AstRL demonstrates a novel, effective approach to AMS synthesis that enables generalized circuit generation with expert-aligned performance, addressing the longstanding challenge of automation in analog and mixed-signal circuit design.

Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) lie at the core of modern computing and communications systems. However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation. Experimental results for three realistic design tasks illustrate substantial improvements in conventional design metrics over state-of-the-art baselines, with 100% of generated designs being structurally correct and over 90% demonstrating required functionality.

### [38] [Soft Contamination Means Benchmarks Test Shallow Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12413)
*Ari Spiesberger,Juan J. Vazquez,Nicky Pochinkov,Tomáš Gavenčiak,Peli Grietzer,Gavin Leech,Nandi Schoots*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM benchmark performance is biased when training data contains semantic duplicates of test benchmarks, not just exact string matches. The paper shows widespread semantic contamination improves benchmark scores but doesn't reflect true out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark performance of LLMs gives biased estimates of out-of-distribution generalization when training data contains test data. Current decontamination methods using n-gram matching fail to detect semantic duplicates (similar content but different wording), leading to soft contamination that inflates benchmark scores.

Method: The researchers study soft contamination by semantic duplicates through multiple experiments, including embedding the Olmo3 training corpus to detect semantic duplicates. They analyze how including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training affects performance, and examine finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints.

Result: 1) Contamination remains widespread - semantic duplicates found for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems. 2) Including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training improves benchmark performance. 3) Finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints also improves performance on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark.

Conclusion: Recent benchmark gains are confounded - they reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data (and effective test data) in growing training corpora. Semantic contamination means benchmark performance doesn't accurately measure true out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: If LLM training data is polluted with benchmark test data, then benchmark performance gives biased estimates of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Typical decontamination filters use n-gram matching which fail to detect semantic duplicates: sentences with equivalent (or near-equivalent) content that are not close in string space. We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark. We argue that recent benchmark gains are thus confounded: the prevalence of soft contamination means gains reflect both genuine capability improvements and the accumulation of test data and effective test data in growing training corpora.

TL;DR: LLMs can be trained from scratch using only low-rank weights without full-rank guidance, solving instability via spectral norm control with Spectron, enabling compute-optimal low-rank transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face computational and memory challenges due to growing parameter counts. While low-rank factorization offers a promising solution, there's no stable method to train models from scratch using only low-rank weights that matches dense model performance.

Method: The paper introduces Spectron (Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization) which addresses training instability in low-rank training. It dynamically bounds weight updates based on current spectral norms of factors to control the spectral norm growth that causes loss spikes.

Result: Enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Demonstrates that LLMs can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights without auxiliary full-rank guidance. Establishes compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers with predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Spectron provides a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights, matching dense model performance while reducing computational costs, and establishes practical scaling laws for low-rank transformers.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success, yet their growing parameter counts pose significant computational and memory challenges. Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary "full-rank" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.

Motivation: Reinforcement learning lacks provable safety guarantees needed for safety-critical applications, especially for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems.

Method: Integrates a backup policy (shield) with RL agent, uses Gaussian process-based uncertainty quantification to predict safety constraint violations, and employs dynamic recovery to safe trajectories when needed. Experience from shielded agent builds GP models with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling.

Result: Empirically demonstrates strong performance and strict safety-compliance on a suite of continuous control environments.

Conclusion: The recovery-based shielding framework enables safe RL with provable safety lower bounds for unknown nonlinear continuous systems, allowing unrestricted exploration without compromising safety.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimal decision-making and control but often lacks provable guarantees for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel recovery-based shielding framework that enables safe RL with a provable safety lower bound for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems. The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary. Experience gathered by the 'shielded' agent is used to construct the GP models, with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling - enabling unrestricted exploration and sample efficient learning, without compromising safety. Empirically our approach demonstrates strong performance and strict safety-compliance on a suite of continuous control environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gibbs distribution learning either requires full samples (impractical for physical systems) or relies on sufficient statistics (computationally hard). The paper seeks efficient methods using only limited statistics.

Method: Uses Ising model as a test case. Develops approach to reconstruct parameters for a model with ℓ₁ width γ by observing statistics up to order O(γ). Also explores setting with prior structural knowledge to further reduce observational requirements.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of parameter reconstruction using limited statistics up to O(γ). Shows efficient learning of model structure, couplings, and magnetic fields. Proves even greater efficiency when structural priors are available.

Conclusion: Computationally efficient learning of Gibbs distributions is possible with limited statistical observations, bridging the gap between computational power and observational constraints in physical system modeling.

Abstract: Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\ell_1$ width $γ$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(γ)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.

*Jinwoo Kim,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free guidance method called Diffinity that steers continuous diffusion language models to satisfy formal syntactic constraints expressed using regular expressions, achieving high constraint satisfaction with minimal perplexity cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models offer advantages over autoregressive models with global, non-causal generation, but their continuous latent dynamics make it difficult to impose discrete syntactic constraints like JSON schema matching. There's a need for methods to constrain diffusion models without requiring auxiliary classifiers or retraining.

Method: The approach constructs an analytic score estimating the probability that a latent state decodes to a string accepted by a given regular expression, and uses its gradient to guide sampling during denoising. This training-free guidance method targets the base model conditioned on syntactic validity without requiring auxiliary classifiers.

Result: Implemented in Diffinity on top of PLAID diffusion model, evaluated on 180 regular-expression constraints over JSON and natural-language benchmarks. Achieves 68-96% constraint satisfaction while incurring only small perplexity cost relative to unconstrained sampling, outperforming autoregressive constrained decoding in both constraint satisfaction and output quality.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free guidance method successfully enables diffusion language models to satisfy formal syntactic constraints expressed using regular expressions, providing a practical approach for constrained generation with diffusion models while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models due to their global, non-causal generation process, but their continuous latent dynamics make discrete constraints -- e.g., the output should be a JSON file that matches a given schema -- difficult to impose. We introduce a training-free guidance method for steering continuous diffusion language models to satisfy formal syntactic constraints expressed using regular expressions. Our approach constructs an analytic score estimating the probability that a latent state decodes to a valid string accepted by a given regular expression, and uses its gradient to guide sampling, without training auxiliary classifiers. The denoising process targets the base model conditioned on syntactic validity.

### [43] [Regularized Meta-Learning for Improved Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12469)
*Noor Islam S. Mohammad,Md Muntaqim Meherab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A regularized meta-learning framework for ensemble methods addresses redundancy, multicollinearity, and overfitting through redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models, achieving improved predictive performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensemble methods suffer from three practical limitations: redundancy among base models (inflating computational cost and degrading conditioning), unstable weighting under multicollinearity, and overfitting in meta-learning pipelines.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: 1) Redundancy-aware projection using multi-metric de-duplication with correlation and MSE thresholds, 2) Statistical meta-feature augmentation with engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms, 3) Cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet), and 4) Inverse-RMSE blending to mitigate regularizer-selection variance.

Result: On Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), achieved out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with 4x faster runtime. Conditioning analysis showed 53.7% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection.

Conclusion: The regularized meta-learning framework provides a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems, addressing key limitations of traditional ensemble methods while maintaining predictive performance.

Abstract: Deep ensemble methods often improve predictive performance, yet they suffer from three practical limitations: redundancy among base models that inflates computational cost and degrades conditioning, unstable weighting under multicollinearity, and overfitting in meta-learning pipelines. We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($τ_{\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending. These results position regularized meta-learning as a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems.

*Milan Gautam,Ning Dai,Tianshuo Zhou,Bowen Xie,David Mathews,Liang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper frames RNA design as conditional sequence generation using autoregressive language models trained with supervised learning and RL optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNA design is computationally challenging due to exponentially large sequence space and competing folds; traditional optimization approaches rely on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search, which lacks reusability.

Method: Reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation using autoregressive LM as reusable neural approximator; train supervised on random structure-sequence pairs, then RL to optimize end-to-end metrics; propose subset selection methods to improve RL efficiency/quality.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics like Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster across four datasets.

Conclusion: Conditional LM generation is a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

Abstract: RNA design, the task of finding a sequence that folds into a target secondary structure, has broad biological and biomedical impact but remains computationally challenging due to the exponentially large sequence space and exponentially many competing folds. Traditional approaches treat it as an optimization problem, relying on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search. We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality. Across four datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics such as Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster, establishing conditional LM generation as a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

### [45] [Tight Bounds for Logistic Regression with Large Stepsize Gradient Descent in Low Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12471)
*Michael Crawshaw,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient descent with large step size achieves accelerated O(1/T²) convergence for logistic regression on separable 2D data by analyzing the transition from unstable to stable dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent work showed that GD with large step size (η=Θ(γ²T)) can achieve accelerated 1/T² convergence for logistic loss on separable data, but the dynamics involve non-monotonic loss behavior. The paper aims to provide a tighter analysis, especially for 2D data, to better understand the transition from unstable to stable convergence phases.

Method: Analyze GD dynamics on 2D separable data with large step sizes. Focus on the orthogonal subspace to the max-margin classifier to study oscillatory behavior. Provide upper and lower bounds on the transition time τ from unstable (non-monotonic) to stable (monotonic) convergence phases.

Result: Show GD with large η achieves loss O(1/(ηT)) when T ≥ Ω(n/γ + 1/γ²), where n is dataset size and γ is margin. Provide tight bounds on transition time τ that match up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating the analysis is tight.

Conclusion: For 2D separable data, GD with large step size transitions quickly from unstable to stable dynamics, enabling accelerated convergence rates. The analysis provides new insights into non-monotonic GD behavior and establishes tight bounds on the transition phase.

Abstract: We consider the optimization problem of minimizing the logistic loss with gradient descent to train a linear model for binary classification with separable data. With a budget of $T$ iterations, it was recently shown that an accelerated $1/T^2$ rate is possible by choosing a large step size $η= Θ(γ^2 T)$ (where $γ$ is the dataset's margin) despite the resulting non-monotonicity of the loss. In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis of gradient descent for this problem when the data is two-dimensional: we show that GD with a sufficiently large learning rate $η$ finds a point with loss smaller than $\mathcal{O}(1/(ηT))$, as long as $T \geq Ω(n/γ+ 1/γ^2)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Our improved rate comes from a tighter bound on the time $τ$ that it takes for GD to transition from unstable (non-monotonic loss) to stable (monotonic loss), via a fine-grained analysis of the oscillatory dynamics of GD in the subspace orthogonal to the max-margin classifier. We also provide a lower bound of $τ$ matching our upper bound up to logarithmic factors, showing that our analysis is tight.

*Chanyoung Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a constructive geometric approach to neural network universal approximation using two hidden layers with sigmoidal or ReLU activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a constructive proof of neural network universal approximation theorems with explicit geometric construction, addressing the need for practical network design rather than just existence proofs.

Method: The paper introduces a geometric construction for separating disjoint compact subsets of ℝⁿ, then uses this separation method to build neural networks with two hidden layers that can approximate any continuous function on compact sets.

Result: Shows that networks with two hidden layers and either sigmoidal (strictly monotone bounded continuous) or ReLU activation can approximate any real-valued continuous function on arbitrary compact sets to any prescribed accuracy in uniform norm.

Conclusion: The geometric construction provides both theoretical insight and practical utility for neural network design, with simplified depth-2 networks for finite sets yielding sharp approximation results.

Abstract: We give a geometric construction of neural networks that separate disjoint compact subsets of $\Bbb R^n$, and use it to obtain a constructive universal approximation theorem. Specifically, we show that networks with two hidden layers and either a sigmoidal activation (i.e., strictly monotone bounded continuous) or the ReLU activation can approximate any real-valued continuous function on an arbitrary compact set $K\subset\Bbb R^n$ to any prescribed accuracy in the uniform norm. For finite $K$, the construction simplifies and yields a sharp depth-2 (single hidden layer) approximation result.

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows Mamba-style selective state space models achieve guaranteed generalization with provable sample complexity bounds, with gating mechanism performing effective feature selection similar to attention but through selective recurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Mamba and other selective SSMs have shown empirical success, their theoretical foundations remain underexplored compared to attention-based architectures like Transformers. There's a need to understand when and why these models learn efficiently and how their selective mechanisms work theoretically.

Method: Analyzed a simplified Mamba block: single-layer, single-head selective SSM with input-dependent gating followed by a two-layer MLP trained via gradient descent. Used structured data model with tokens containing both class-relevant and irrelevant patterns under token-level noise, examining majority-voting and locality-structured data regimes.

Result: Proved guaranteed generalization with non-asymptotic sample complexity and convergence rate bounds. Showed gating vector aligns with class-relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, formalizing a feature-selection mechanism similar to attention but through selective recurrence. Numerical experiments on synthetic data validated theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Selective SSMs like Mamba can achieve efficient learning with provable generalization guarantees. Their gating mechanism performs effective feature selection, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to attention-based architectures and providing insight into when these models succeed.

Abstract: The recent empirical success of Mamba and other selective state space models (SSMs) has renewed interest in non-attention architectures for sequence modeling, yet their theoretical foundations remain underexplored. We present a first-step analysis of generalization and learning dynamics for a simplified but representative Mamba block: a single-layer, single-head selective SSM with input-dependent gating, followed by a two-layer MLP trained via gradient descent (GD). Our study adopts a structured data model with tokens that include both class-relevant and class-irrelevant patterns under token-level noise and examines two canonical regimes: majority-voting and locality-structured data sequences. We prove that the model achieves guaranteed generalization by establishing non-asymptotic sample complexity and convergence rate bounds, which improve as the effective signal increases and the noise decreases. Furthermore, we show that the gating vector aligns with class-relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, thereby formalizing a feature-selection role similar to attention but realized through selective recurrence. Numerical experiments on synthetic data justify our theoretical results. Overall, our results provide principled insight into when and why Mamba-style selective SSMs learn efficiently, offering a theoretical counterpoint to Transformer-centric explanations.

*Rosie Zhao,Anshul Shah,Xiaoyu Zhu,Xinke Deng,Zhongyu Jiang,Yang Yang,Joerg Liebelt,Arnab Mondal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning of vision-language models boosts benchmark accuracy but creates vulnerabilities to textual perturbations, revealing a trade-off between accuracy and faithfulness where models lose visual grounding and become over-reliant on text cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RL fine-tuning has improved LLMs on reasoning tasks, its extension to VLMs creates vulnerabilities including weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on text. The research investigates how simple textual perturbations can undermine VLM robustness and examines the accuracy-faithfulness trade-off in RL fine-tuning dynamics.

Method: 1) Test robustness using controlled textual perturbations (misleading captions or incorrect CoT traces) on open-source multimodal reasoning models; 2) Measure effects using accuracy drops, confidence changes, and CoT consistency metrics; 3) Analyze uncertainty via entropy-based metrics; 4) Study RL fine-tuning dynamics to identify accuracy-faithfulness trade-off; 5) Explore mitigation strategies including adversarial augmentation and faithfulness-aware rewards.

Result: 1) Simple textual perturbations cause substantial robustness and confidence drops, especially when considering CoT consistency; 2) Perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass distribution on correct options; 3) RL fine-tuning improves benchmark accuracy but erodes CoT reliability and robustness to contextual shifts; 4) Adversarial augmentation improves robustness but doesn't prevent faithfulness drift; 5) Faithfulness-aware rewards restore answer-reasoning alignment but can collapse onto shortcut strategies when paired with augmentation.

Conclusion: Accuracy-only evaluations for RL-tuned VLMs are insufficient. There exists an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off where fine-tuning improves scores but damages visual grounding. Training and assessment must jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning through better protocols and metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks, motivating its extension to vision language models (VLMs). While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.

*Qinhang Wu,Sen Lin,Ming Zhang,Yingbin Liang,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRT introduces a constraint-rectified training framework that optimizes reasoning efficiency in LLMs by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy, yielding checkpoints with varying verbosity levels without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Chain-of-Thought improves LLM reasoning, longer traces increase inference costs and introduce redundant steps (overthinking). Existing heuristic approaches for efficient reasoning suffer from accuracy drops and hyperparameter sensitivity, requiring a more stable and principled solution.

Method: CRT uses reference-guarded constrained optimization that alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference. It includes a two-stage training scheme: first discovering the shortest reliable reasoning patterns, then refining accuracy under a learned length budget.

Result: CRT consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality. It improves reasoning efficiency by shortening responses and reducing internal language redundancy, creating a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that enable fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.

Conclusion: CRT provides a stable, interpretable framework for efficient reasoning that addresses overthinking while preserving accuracy, offering flexible control over reasoning verbosity through intermediate checkpoints.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training methods. While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.

TL;DR: Extension of Hierarchical Dirichlet Process to exponential family distributions with explicit derivations for Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under HDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While HDP is flexible for grouped data, existing applications focus on Dirichlet-multinomial conjugate structure. The framework can accommodate broader conjugate prior-likelihood pairs, particularly exponential family distributions which offer unified modeling paradigm.

Method: Investigate analytic results for Poisson and normal distributions within HDP framework. Derive explicit closed-form expressions for Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under hierarchical Dirichlet process construction.

Result: Provide detailed derivations and proofs for Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs, demonstrating systematic exploitation of conjugacy in hierarchical nonparametric models.

Conclusion: Extends applicability of HDP beyond Dirichlet-multinomial setting and provides practical analytic results for researchers using hierarchical Bayesian nonparametrics.

Abstract: The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) provides a flexible Bayesian nonparametric framework for modeling grouped data with a shared yet unbounded collection of mixture components. While existing applications of the HDP predominantly focus on the Dirichlet-multinomial conjugate structure, the framework itself is considerably more general and, in principle, accommodates a broad class of conjugate prior-likelihood pairs. In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models. Our work extends the applicability of the HDP beyond the Dirichlet-multinomial setting and furnishes practical analytic results for researchers employing hierarchical Bayesian nonparametrics.

*Zihan Huang,Xintong Li,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Rui Wang,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang,Junda Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an instance-aware approach to adjust modality preference in Multimodal LLMs, using sample-specific diagnostic metrics and adaptive scaling strategies instead of uniform steering intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often exhibit modality preference (favoring one modality over another), and existing methods use uniform steering intensity which is problematic because strong steering increases error rates while weak steering is ineffective, plus steering sensitivity varies across instances.

Method: Developed an instance-aware diagnostic metric to quantify each modality's information contribution and reveal sample-specific susceptibility to steering, then proposed a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module to infer scaling patterns for instance-aware control.

Result: Experimental results show that instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.

Conclusion: Instance-aware steering provides a more effective and less disruptive approach to adjusting modality preference in MLLMs by accounting for sample-specific sensitivity variations, addressing limitations of uniform steering methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibit significant modality preference, which is a tendency to favor one modality over another. Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.

TL;DR: ExtraCare: a domain adaptation method for EHR clinical event prediction that decomposes patient representations into invariant and covariant components, improving accuracy and providing transparent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for clinical event prediction on EHR often degrade under different data distributions, and existing domain adaptation methods lack transparency, which is crucial for trust and safety in clinical practice.

Method: Proposes ExtraCare to decompose patient representations into invariant (label-preserving) and covariant (domain-specific variation) components, supervising both and enforcing orthogonality during training.

Result: Evaluated on two real-world EHR datasets across multiple domain partitions, demonstrating superior performance over most feature alignment models and enhanced transparency with human-understandable explanations.

Conclusion: ExtraCare effectively mitigates domain shifts in EHR data while offering transparent explanations through sparse latent dimensions mapped to medical concepts, facilitating trust and adoption in clinical settings.

Abstract: Deep learning models for clinical event prediction on electronic health records (EHR) often suffer performance degradation when deployed under different data distributions. While domain adaptation (DA) methods can mitigate such shifts, its "black-box" nature prevents widespread adoption in clinical practice where transparency is essential for trust and safety. We propose ExtraCare to decompose patient representations into invariant and covariant components. By supervising these two components and enforcing their orthogonality during training, our model preserves label information while exposing domain-specific variation at the same time for more accurate predictions than most feature alignment models. More importantly, it offers human-understandable explanations by mapping sparse latent dimensions to medical concepts and quantifying their contributions via targeted ablations. ExtraCare is evaluated on two real-world EHR datasets across multiple domain partition settings, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced transparency, as evidenced by its accurate predictions and explanations from extensive case studies.

TL;DR: SD-MoE addresses the lack of expert specialization in MoE models by decoupling overlapping spectral components in parameters and gradients, improving performance and enabling effective expert specialization with minimal computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE architectures suffer from ineffective expert specialization where experts become functionally similar or act as shared experts, limiting the effective capacity and model performance.

Method: Proposes Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE) which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space to address overlapping dominant spectral components that prevent expert specialization.

Result: SD-MoE improves performance across downstream tasks, enables effective expert specialization, incurs minimal additional computation, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MoE architectures like Qwen and DeepSeek.

Conclusion: By analyzing MoE from a spectral perspective and decoupling overlapping spectral components, SD-MoE effectively addresses the expert specialization problem in MoE architectures, enhancing model performance with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale Large Language Models via expert specialization induced by conditional computation. In practice, however, expert specialization often fails: some experts become functionally similar, while others functioning as de facto shared experts, limiting the effective capacity and model performance. In this work, we analysis from a spectral perspective on parameter and gradient spaces, uncover that (1) experts share highly overlapping dominant spectral components in their parameters, (2) dominant gradient subspaces are strongly aligned across experts, driven by ubiquitous low-rank structure in human corpus, and (3) gating mechanisms preferentially route inputs along these dominant directions, further limiting specialization. To address this, we propose Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE), which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space. SD-MoE improves performance across downstream tasks, enables effective expert specialization, incurring minimal additional computation, and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing MoE architectures, including Qwen and DeepSeek.

Method: Introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg) with two client-side mechanisms: 1) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization that dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and 2) non-integer-order local optimization incorporating short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations, and allows independent toggling of each component.

Result: Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets (VED and eVED) show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.

Conclusion: FO-RI-FedAvg provides a lightweight and modular extension to FedAvg that effectively improves stability in federated learning for electric vehicle applications, addressing challenges of intermittent connectivity and client variability while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning on connected electric vehicles (BEVs) faces severe instability due to intermittent connectivity, time-varying client participation, and pronounced client-to-client variation induced by diverse operating conditions. Conventional FedAvg and many advanced methods can suffer from excessive drift and degraded convergence under these realistic constraints. This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.

*Xin-Qiang Cai,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework (VI-CuRL) addresses training instability in verifier-free reinforcement learning for LLMs by using intrinsic confidence to create a curriculum that reduces gradient variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR's reliance on external verifiers limits scalability, and standard verifier-free methods suffer from destructive gradient variance that leads to training collapse.

Method: VI-CuRL uses the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers, prioritizing high-confidence samples to manage bias-variance trade-off and reduce action/problem variance.

Result: VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.

Conclusion: VI-CuRL provides a verifier-independent solution that addresses training instability through confidence-based curriculum learning, with theoretical guarantees of asymptotic unbiasedness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning, yet its reliance on external verifiers limits its scalability. Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness. Empirically, VI-CuRL promotes stability and consistently outperforms verifier-independent baselines across six challenging benchmarks with/without verifiers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MH-MoE introduces head-wise routing in Mixture-of-Experts Transformers to reduce composition collisions that cause forgetting in continual learning, improving performance over standard MoE approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts architectures should theoretically excel at continual learning due to sparse routing that localizes updates and reduces interference, but current MoE Transformers still suffer substantial forgetting even with sparse, well-balanced expert utilization.

Method: The paper proposes MH-MoE (Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts), which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations instead of routing on concatenated head outputs. This increases routing granularity and reduces composition collisions where different feature compositions get mapped to the same expert route.

Result: MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting in continual learning scenarios. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B models, it reduces Backward Transfer (BWT) on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE baseline) to 4.5%, demonstrating significant improvement in preserving old task knowledge.

Conclusion: The pre-routing bottleneck in standard MoE Transformers, where multi-head attention concatenates head signals into a single router input, causes composition collisions that lead to forgetting in continual learning. Head-wise routing in MH-MoE addresses this limitation and enables more effective continual learning with Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are often considered a natural fit for continual learning because sparse routing should localize updates and reduce interference, yet MoE Transformers still forget substantially even with sparse, well-balanced expert utilization. We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions. On TRACE with Qwen3-0.6B/8B, MH-MoE effectively mitigates forgetting, reducing BWT on Qwen3-0.6B from 11.2% (LoRAMoE) to 4.5%.

*Hemant Prasad,Daisuke Ikefuji,Shin Tominaga,Hitoshi Sakurai,Manabu Otani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for detecting single-lane traffic abnormalities using fiber-optic sensing by tracking vehicle paths and lane changes through vibration analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While DFOS systems are cost-effective for wide-area traffic monitoring and congestion detection, they struggle to identify single-lane abnormalities that lead to congestion. These single-lane issues can be detected by monitoring vehicle lane change behavior as drivers avoid congestion.

Method: The method estimates vehicle positions at all time instances and fits vehicle paths using clustering techniques. Lane changes are detected by monitoring changes in the spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking reference vehicles along a highway section.

Result: Evaluation with real traffic data showed 80% accuracy for detecting lane change events, which represent the presence of single-lane abnormalities.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully detects single-lane abnormalities by analyzing vehicle lane change behavior through vibration-based tracking, addressing a key limitation in existing DFOS systems for traffic monitoring.

Abstract: The distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) system is a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring technology that utilizes existing fiber infrastructure to effectively detect traffic congestions. However, detecting single-lane abnormalities, that lead to congestions, is still a challenge. These single-lane abnormalities can be detected by monitoring lane change behaviour of vehicles, performed to avoid congestion along the monitoring section of a road. This paper presents a method to detect single-lane abnormalities by tracking individual vehicle paths and detecting vehicle lane changes along a section of a road. We propose a method to estimate the vehicle position at all time instances and fit a path using clustering techniques. We detect vehicle lane change by monitoring any change in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking a reference vehicle along a highway. The evaluation of our proposed method with real traffic data showed 80% accuracy for lane change detection events that represent presence of abnormalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PICODE Networks combine anomaly detection with interpretable explanations using causality-informed ODEs for power grid CPS


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML models for time series anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems are black boxes that provide only binary outputs without explanations like anomaly type, origin, or root cause. This lack of interpretability is problematic for safety-critical systems like power grids.

Method: Proposes Power Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (PICODE) Networks - a unified, causality-informed architecture that jointly performs anomaly detection along with explanations. It uses ODEs to extract causal graphs and align anomaly shapes with causal weight changes.

Result: Experiments in power systems show PICODE achieves competitive detection performance while offering improved interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data or external causal graphs. Theoretical results demonstrate alignment between anomaly function shapes and causal graph weight changes.

Conclusion: PICODE provides a unified framework for interpretable anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, addressing the black-box limitation of existing approaches by combining detection with root cause analysis, anomaly classification, and shape characterization.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) are critical for ensuring the safety and resilience of cyber-physical systems such as power grids. However, existing machine learning models for time series anomaly detection often operate as black boxes, offering only binary outputs without any explanation, such as identifying anomaly type and origin. To address this challenge, we propose Power Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (PICODE) Networks, a unified, causality-informed architecture that jointly performs anomaly detection along with the explanation why it is detected as an anomaly, including root cause localization, anomaly type classification, and anomaly shape characterization. Experimental results in power systems demonstrate that PICODE achieves competitive detection performance while offering improved interpretability and reduced reliance on labeled data or external causal graphs. We provide theoretical results demonstrating the alignment between the shape of anomaly functions and the changes in the weights of the extracted causal graphs.

### [60] [HyperMLP: An Integrated Perspective for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12601)
*Jiecheng Lu,Shihao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperMLP and HyperGLU as alternatives to softmax attention, framing attention heads as dynamic two-layer MLPs that perform input-conditioned selection over context-dependent memory rather than probabilistic distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors challenge the conventional probabilistic query-key lookup interpretation of self-attention. They advocate for a simpler, unified perspective that views autoregressive attention as a dynamic two-layer MLP, enabling more flexible input-conditioned selection mechanisms beyond normalized probability distributions.

Method: Propose HyperMLP and HyperGLU architectures that learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space. These use a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics, replacing softmax attention with standard MLP activations like ReLU or GLU.

Result: Empirical results show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets. The theoretical analysis characterizes the expressivity and implications of this alternative attention structure.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that viewing attention as dynamic MLPs rather than probabilistic distributions leads to effective alternatives (HyperMLP/HyperGLU) that outperform traditional attention mechanisms while maintaining computational efficiency and alignment with autoregressive semantics.

Abstract: Self-attention is often viewed as probabilistic query-key lookup, motivating designs that preserve normalized attention scores and fixed positional semantics. We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.

### [61] [Block-Sample MAC-Bayes Generalization Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12605)
*Matthias Frey,Jingge Zhu,Michael C. Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A family of novel MAC-Bayes bounds that bound expected generalization error with block-sample structure, potentially tighter than traditional PAC-Bayes bounds, but high-probability versions are generally impossible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PAC-Bayes bounds give high-probability guarantees but can be loose or vacuous. There's a need for tighter bounds on expected generalization error that better account for data dependencies through block structure.

Method: Propose a family of block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds that generalize expectation versions of known PAC-Bayes bounds. The bounds contain divergence terms depending only on subsets (blocks) of training data, enabling analysis of data dependencies.

Result: The MAC-Bayes bounds can be significantly tighter than traditional bounds (non-vacuous where PAC-Bayes is vacuous). However, high-probability PAC-Bayes versions with similar block structure are shown to be generally impossible, with counterexamples demonstrating fundamental limitations.

Conclusion: Block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds offer promising tighter bounds for expected generalization error, but cannot be straightforwardly converted to high-probability PAC-Bayes bounds with similar rates and logarithmic dependence on error probability.

Abstract: We present a family of novel block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds (mean approximately correct). While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\mathcal{O}(1/\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.

### [62] [Unifying Model-Free Efficiency and Model-Based Representations via Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12643)
*Jashaswimalya Acharjee,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ULD is a RL algorithm that combines model-free efficiency with model-based representational power by learning latent embeddings where value functions become approximately linear, achieving strong performance across diverse domains with minimal tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current RL approaches: model-free methods are sample-efficient but lack representational power for adaptation, while model-based approaches provide strong representations but require planning overhead. There's a need for an algorithm that unifies these strengths without the computational cost of explicit planning.

Method: ULD embeds state-action pairs into a latent space where the true value function is approximately linear. It uses synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization. The method leverages embedding-based temporal-difference updates that theoretically align with linear model-based value expansion.

Result: The algorithm achieves performance matching or exceeding specialized model-free and general model-based baselines across 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari games. It demonstrates cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and reduced parameter footprint.

Conclusion: Value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning, suggesting a promising direction for RL algorithms that unify efficiency and representational power without planning overhead.

Abstract: We present Unified Latent Dynamics (ULD), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that unifies the efficiency of model-free methods with the representational strengths of model-based approaches, without incurring planning overhead. By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning.

TL;DR: RelBench v2 introduces an expanded benchmark for relational deep learning with 4 new large-scale datasets, autocomplete tasks, and integration of external benchmarks like Temporal Graph Benchmark and ReDeLEx.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As relational deep learning evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, there's a critical need for scalable and realistic benchmarks to enable systematic evaluation and progress in the field.

Method: RelBench v2 expands the original benchmark by adding four large-scale relational datasets (covering scholarly publications, ERP, consumer platforms, clinical records), introducing autocomplete tasks that infer missing attribute values within tables under temporal constraints, and integrating external benchmarks including Temporal Graph Benchmark (translated to relational schemas), ReDeLEx (for access to 70+ real-world databases), and 4DBInfer datasets.

Result: Experimental results show that relational deep learning models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, demonstrating the importance of explicitly modeling relational structure.

Conclusion: RelBench v2 provides a comprehensive and scalable benchmark suite that advances relational deep learning evaluation, showing the effectiveness of relational models over single-table approaches and enabling broader research in this evolving paradigm.

Abstract: Relational deep learning (RDL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning directly on relational databases by modeling entities and their relationships across multiple interconnected tables. As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress. In this paper, we introduce RelBench v2, a major expansion of the RelBench benchmark for RDL. RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that RDL models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, highlighting the importance of modeling relational structure explicitly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLA2 improves sparse-linear attention by replacing heuristic split with learnable routing and introduces sparse + low-bit attention for better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) uses heuristic split based on attention-weight magnitude which can be suboptimal, and there's a mismatch between SLA and direct decomposition into sparse/linear attention.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) learnable router for dynamic selection between sparse/linear attention, (2) more faithful sparse-linear attention formulation with learnable combination ratio, (3) sparse + low-bit attention via quantization-aware fine-tuning.

Result: SLA2 achieves 97% attention sparsity, 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality in video diffusion models.

Conclusion: SLA2 provides more efficient and optimized sparse-linear attention mechanism for diffusion models, particularly beneficial for video generation tasks.

Abstract: Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) combines sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models and has shown strong performance in video generation. However, (i) SLA relies on a heuristic split that assigns computations to the sparse or linear branch based on attention-weight magnitude, which can be suboptimal. Additionally, (ii) after formally analyzing the attention error in SLA, we identify a mismatch between SLA and a direct decomposition into sparse and linear attention. We propose SLA2, which introduces (I) a learnable router that dynamically selects whether each attention computation should use sparse or linear attention, (II) a more faithful and direct sparse-linear attention formulation that uses a learnable ratio to combine the sparse and linear attention branches, and (III) a sparse + low-bit attention design, where low-bit attention is introduced via quantization-aware fine-tuning to reduce quantization error. Experiments show that on video diffusion models, SLA2 can achieve 97% attention sparsity and deliver an 18.6x attention speedup while preserving generation quality.

TL;DR: Coden is a Temporal Graph Neural Network designed for efficient continuous predictions on dynamic graphs, overcoming computational bottlenecks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TGNNs only handle one-time predictions, but real-world applications need continuous predictions over time. Direct adaptation leads to computational overhead or quality issues.

Method: Introduces Coden, a novel TGNN architecture that overcomes complexity bottlenecks for continuous predictions while preserving predictive accuracy.

Result: Coden surpasses existing benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness across five dynamic datasets, proving superior for continuous prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Coden provides an effective and efficient solution for continuous predictions in TGNNs with theoretical justification and empirical validation.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are pivotal in processing dynamic graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.

*Jeonghyun Kim,SooKyung Kim,Richeng Xuan,Hyunsoo Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUD improves knowledge distillation by calibrating teacher uncertainty to preserve informative dark knowledge, creating more accurate and robust students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cross-entropy trained teachers produce overconfident, brittle distributions that collapse dark knowledge, hindering knowledge transfer especially in high-cardinality tasks and reducing student robustness under distribution shifts.

Method: Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD) shapes teacher predictive distributions before transfer, encouraging informative uncertainty revelation and guiding students to learn from calibrated rather than overconfident targets.

Result: CUD yields students that are more accurate, better calibrated under distribution shifts, and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: By approaching distillation from a distributional perspective and calibrating uncertainty, CUD makes dark knowledge more faithfully accessible for creating robust, well-calibrated student models.

Abstract: The core of knowledge distillation lies in transferring the teacher's rich 'dark knowledge'-subtle probabilistic patterns that reveal how classes are related and the distribution of uncertainties. While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT networks need security solutions, but existing federated PCA methods lack both personalization and robustness, which are critical for effective anomaly detection in distributed IoT environments.

Method: Develops personalized federated PCA with local representations using ℓ₁-norm for element-wise sparsity (personalization) and ℓ₂,₁-norm for row-wise sparsity (robustness), solved via manifold optimization algorithm based on ADMM.

Result: FedEP outperforms state-of-the-art FedPG, achieving excellent F1-scores and accuracy across various IoT security scenarios, with code made publicly available.

Conclusion: FedEP provides an effective solution for IoT anomaly detection by successfully integrating personalization and robustness into federated PCA framework.

Abstract: Internet of things (IoT) networks face increasing security threats due to their distributed nature and resource constraints. Although federated learning (FL) has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving framework for distributed IoT environments, current federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack the integration of personalization and robustness, which are critical for effective anomaly detection. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient personalized federated PCA (FedEP) method for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model achieves personalization through introducing local representations with the $\ell_1$-norm for element-wise sparsity, while maintaining robustness via enforcing local models with the $\ell_{2,1}$-norm for row-wise sparsity. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a manifold optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimental results confirm that the proposed FedEP outperforms the state-of-the-art FedPG, achieving excellent F1-scores and accuracy in various IoT security scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current telemetry-aware routing systems using Machine Learning sacrifice explainability due to the black-box nature of neural routing modules, making it difficult to understand and trust routing decisions during network events.

Method: Proposes Placer, which uses Message Passing Networks to transform network states into latent node embeddings. These embeddings enable quick greedy next-hop routing without solving the all-pairs shortest paths problem directly.

Result: The approach facilitates visualization of how specific network events influence routing decisions, providing both efficiency in routing computation and explainability missing from previous ML-based methods.

Conclusion: Placer offers a promising approach to telemetry-aware routing that balances performance with explainability, addressing a key limitation of current ML-based routing systems while maintaining efficiency through embedding-based greedy routing.

Abstract: Telemetry-Aware routing promises to increase efficacy and responsiveness to traffic surges in computer networks. Recent research leverages Machine Learning to deal with the complex dependency between network state and routing, but sacrifices explainability of routing decisions due to the black-box nature of the proposed neural routing modules. We propose \emph{Placer}, a novel algorithm using Message Passing Networks to transform network states into latent node embeddings. These embeddings facilitate quick greedy next-hop routing without directly solving the all-pairs shortest paths problem, and let us visualize how certain network events shape routing decisions.

*Sangwoo Jo,Sungjoon Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDM: A geometric framework for adaptive solver selection and scheduling in diffusion models that optimizes sampling efficiency without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high sampling costs that limit practical deployment. Current approaches use static heuristics for solver selection and scheduling, lacking a principled approach aligned with the intrinsic properties of diffusion trajectories.

Method: SDM analyzes ODE dynamics of diffusion trajectories and proposes a geometric framework. It shows low-order solvers suffice for early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers handle later nonlinear stages. Introduces Wasserstein-bounded optimization for adaptive timestep scheduling that explicitly bounds local discretization error.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training: FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2 with reduced function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

Conclusion: SDM provides a principled geometric framework for optimizing diffusion model sampling efficiency through adaptive solver selection and scheduling, bridging the gap between discrete solvers and continuous diffusion dynamics while maintaining fidelity to the underlying process.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable performance across various domains, yet their practical deployment is often limited by high sampling costs. While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

*Zhan Qu,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAIL is a framework for next-visit clinical event prediction that uses structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval to overcome challenges in EHR analysis like data sparsity and LLM hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting future clinical events from EHRs is difficult due to sparse multi-type events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and LLM hallucinations when reasoning over long structured patient histories.

Method: GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph combining coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations, embeds it in hyperbolic space, summarizes visits as probabilistic Central Events, retrieves clinically plausible future events using structure-aware retrieval, and optionally refines ranking with an LLM as a constrained reranker.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-IV show GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and produces more hierarchy-consistent forecasts compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: GRAIL effectively addresses EHR prediction challenges through structured geometric representations and retrieval-based approaches, offering a promising direction for clinical forecasting.

Abstract: Predicting future clinical events from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to sparse multi-type clinical events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate when reasoning over long structured histories. We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.

TL;DR: DEG uses large video generation models and contrastive self-supervised learning to create dense rewards for RL without human annotations, balancing coarse-grained exploration with fine-grained matching for efficient task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing suitable rewards in RL for embodied manipulation is challenging. Trajectory success rewards are sparse, limiting RL sample efficiency. While recent dense reward methods improve RL, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision.

Method: Proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG) - leverages large video generation models with only a few expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance per episode. Uses dual-granularity reward balancing coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching to guide agent to approximate generated guidance in contrastive self-supervised latent space.

Result: Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across simulation and real-world settings show DEG can serve as efficient exploration stimulus to help agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, and guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.

Conclusion: DEG is a novel framework that achieves sample-efficient dense rewards without human annotations or extensive supervision, successfully addressing reward design challenges in RL for embodied manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Designing suitable rewards poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially for embodied manipulation. Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.

*Lei Lv,Yunfei Li,Yu Luo,Fuchun Sun,Xiao Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAC is a likelihood-free actor-critic framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing kinetic energy of velocity fields, avoiding explicit action density estimation while achieving max-entropy RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative generative policies (diffusion models, flow matching) offer superior expressivity but complicate Maximum Entropy RL because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. Need a likelihood-free approach to regulate policy stochasticity.

Method: Formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge problem relative to a high-entropy reference process. Use kinetic energy as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from reference. Derive energy-regularized policy iteration scheme with practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes kinetic energy via Lagrangian dual mechanism.

Result: FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.

Conclusion: FLAC provides a principled likelihood-free framework for maximum entropy RL with expressive generative policies, with kinetic energy serving as a natural regularization metric that aligns with physical intuitions.

Abstract: Iterative generative policies, such as diffusion models and flow matching, offer superior expressivity for continuous control but complicate Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.

TL;DR: CellScape is a deep learning framework that jointly models spatial interactions and genomic relationships in spatial transcriptomics data to improve pattern discovery and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics data is noisy, large, and complex, making it difficult for existing methods to effectively capture the interplay between spatial interactions and intrinsic genomic relationships, limiting biological pattern discovery.

Method: CellScape is a deep learning framework that jointly models cellular interactions in tissue space and genomic relationships among cells, creating comprehensive representations that integrate spatial signals with gene regulatory mechanisms.

Result: The framework uncovers biologically informative patterns that improve spatial domain segmentation and supports comprehensive spatial cellular analyses across diverse transcriptomics datasets.

Conclusion: CellScape provides an accurate and versatile framework for deep analysis and interpretation of spatial transcriptomics data by effectively integrating spatial and genomic information.

Abstract: Cellular identity and function are linked to both their intrinsic genomic makeup and extrinsic spatial context within the tissue microenvironment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers an unprecedented opportunity to study this, providing in situ gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution and illuminating the spatial and functional organization of cells within tissues. However, a significant hurdle remains: ST data is inherently noisy, large, and structurally complex. This complexity makes it intractable for existing computational methods to effectively capture the interplay between spatial interactions and intrinsic genomic relationships, thus limiting our ability to discern critical biological patterns. Here, we present CellScape, a deep learning framework designed to overcome these limitations for high-performance ST data analysis and pattern discovery. CellScape jointly models cellular interactions in tissue space and genomic relationships among cells, producing comprehensive representations that seamlessly integrate spatial signals with underlying gene regulatory mechanisms. This technique uncovers biologically informative patterns that improve spatial domain segmentation and supports comprehensive spatial cellular analyses across diverse transcriptomics datasets, offering an accurate and versatile framework for deep analysis and interpretation of ST data.w

*Zesheng Hong,Jiadong Yu,Hui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR aligns LLMs but suppresses rare reasoning paths; ARTS decouples generation from verification via Flow Matching to recover performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR amplifies dominant behaviors but causes a 'Normalization Squeeze' that drives rare correct reasoning paths to extinction, limiting robustness in complex tasks.

Method: Propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS), which uses a Flow Matching objective to leverage the verifier for probability flow conservation, enabling navigation in sparse search spaces without updating the generative model's parameters.

Result: ARTS achieves 74.6% (BoN@16) on MATH-500, matching fine-tuned policies, and recovers significant performance on long-tail subsets where RL optimization fails (0% pass@k).

Conclusion: Disentangling verification from generation with ARTS provides a more robust pathway for complex reasoning, preserving model diversity and addressing the limitations of RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has established itself as the dominant paradigm for instilling rigorous reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a "Normalization Squeeze," where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.

### [75] [X-VORTEX: Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning for Wake Vortex Trajectory Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12869)
*Zhan Qu,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VORTEX: A spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences to track wake vortices, achieving superior performance with only 1% of labeled data compared to supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wake vortices pose major safety and capacity challenges for air traffic management. Tracking them is difficult due to sparse LiDAR scans, fading vortex signatures under atmospheric turbulence, and prohibitive point-wise annotation costs. Existing approaches treat each scan independently, overlooking temporal structure and not scaling to vast unlabeled archives.

Method: X-VORTEX is a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework based on Augmentation Overlap Theory. It constructs paired inputs from the same flight event: a weakly perturbed sequence and a strongly augmented counterpart via temporal subsampling and spatial masking. This encourages the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, it uses a time-distributed geometric encoder for per-scan features and a sequential aggregator to model evolving vortex states across variable-length sequences.

Result: X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines. It was evaluated on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: X-VORTEX demonstrates that spatio-temporal contrastive learning can effectively track wake vortices from sparse, unlabeled LiDAR sequences, significantly reducing annotation requirements while maintaining high performance for vortex localization and trajectory forecasting.

Abstract: Wake vortices are strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft, and they pose a major safety and capacity challenge for air traffic management. Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.

TL;DR: OT-CFM (Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching) admits exact proximal formulation via extended Brenier potential, works for manifold-supported targets without density assumption, and exhibits terminal normal hyperbolicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reformulate OT-CFM with a more rigorous mathematical foundation, particularly addressing cases where target distributions don't have densities and exist on manifolds, and to better understand its dynamical properties.

Method: Extended Brenier potential approach to show OT-CFM admits exact proximal formulation without density assumptions; analysis of minibatch convergence; use of second epi-derivatives of convex potentials to prove terminal normal hyperbolicity.

Result: Mapping to recover target points is exactly given by proximal operator, yielding explicit proximal expression of vector field; minibatch OT-CFM converges to population formulation as batch size increases; OT-CFM is terminally normally hyperbolic for manifold-supported targets.

Conclusion: OT-CFM has solid mathematical foundations with proximal formulation and exhibits desirable dynamical properties (terminal normal hyperbolicity) for manifold-supported distributions, providing theoretical justification for its empirical success.

Abstract: We reformulate Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM), a class of dynamical generative models, showing that it admits an exact proximal formulation via an extended Brenier potential, without assuming that the target distribution has a density. In particular, the mapping to recover the target point is exactly given by a proximal operator, which yields an explicit proximal expression of the vector field. We also discuss the convergence of minibatch OT-CFM to the population formulation as the batch size increases. Finally, using second epi-derivatives of convex potentials, we prove that, for manifold-supported targets, OT-CFM is terminally normally hyperbolic: after time rescaling, the dynamics contracts exponentially in directions normal to the data manifold while remaining neutral along tangential directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theseus is a training-free method for transferring task-specific updates across models with different architectures by matching functional effects on representations rather than parameter values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks produces task-specific parameter updates that are expensive to relearn for each model variant. While updates can be transferred between identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains unexplored.

Method: Theseus characterizes task updates by the functional effect on intermediate representations rather than matching parameters directly. It formalizes task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations, aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis to get a stable closed-form solution that preserves update geometry.

Result: Theseus shows consistent improvements over strong baselines on vision and language models across different widths without additional training or backpropagation. Task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when defined functionally rather than parametrically.

Conclusion: Task updates can be effectively transferred across heterogeneous models by focusing on functional effects rather than parameter values, enabling efficient adaptation without retraining through the Theseus approach.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks often produces task-specific parameter updates that are expensive to relearn for every model variant. While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation. Our results show that task updates can be meaningfully transferred across architectures when task identity is defined functionally rather than parametrically.

*Andrew Thompson,Vivek Desai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCE is a new calibration metric that extends ECE to assess calibration of any variation metric (like entropy), not just confidence, and shows better theoretical properties than existing entropy-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration metrics like ECE only assess calibration of maximum probability/confidence, ignoring the full probability distribution. Other variation metrics like entropy capture more information but existing entropy-based calibration metrics have theoretical issues.

Method: Extend the ECE framework from assessing confidence calibration to assessing calibration of any metric of variation. Propose Variation Calibration Error (VCE) as a generalization that can use different variation measures like entropy.

Result: On synthetic perfectly calibrated predictions, VCE approaches zero as sample size increases (desired property), while another entropy-based calibration metric (UCE) does not show this behavior.

Conclusion: VCE provides a principled extension of ECE to assess calibration of full probability distributions via variation metrics, with better theoretical properties than existing alternatives like UCE.

Abstract: We propose the Variation Calibration Error (VCE) metric for assessing the calibration of machine learning classifiers. The metric can be viewed as an extension of the well-known Expected Calibration Error (ECE) which assesses the calibration of the maximum probability or confidence. Other ways of measuring the variation of a probability distribution exist which have the advantage of taking into account the full probability distribution, for example the Shannon entropy. We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature.

### [79] [Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12693)
*Shreyas Fadnavis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new conformal prediction method called Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP) that weights nonconformity scores by statistical leverage to produce adaptive prediction intervals without auxiliary models, achieving better conditional coverage than constant-width intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard split conformal prediction produces constant-width intervals that perform poorly in heteroscedastic settings - they overcover in low-variance regions and undercover in high-variance regions. Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models, which adds complexity and potential errors.

Method: Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP) weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage (diagonal of the hat matrix), deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. The method preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP.

Result: Theoretical results show LWCP: 1) preserves finite-sample marginal validity; 2) achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at minimal width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; 3) recovers classical Gaussian prediction intervals while retaining distribution-free guarantees; 4) eliminates the persistent conditional coverage gap of vanilla CP. Experimental results on synthetic and real data confirm substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity.

Conclusion: LWCP provides an elegant solution to the conditional coverage problem in conformal prediction by leveraging the geometric structure of the design matrix, requiring no auxiliary models or hyperparameters beyond the weight function choice, making it both theoretically sound and practically effective.

Abstract: Split conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal coverage, but produces constant-width intervals that overcover in low-variance regions and undercover in high-variance regions. Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models. We propose Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP), which weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage -- the diagonal of the hat matrix -- deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates. The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP. Experiments on synthetic and real data confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating substantial reductions in conditional coverage disparity across settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge of detecting anomalies in streaming data that is often unlabeled, particularly in nonstationary environments where concept drift causes model performance deterioration over time. Need for methods that can handle severely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics.

Method: VAE++ESDD employs incremental learning with two-level ensembling: 1) ensemble of Variational AutoEncoders for anomaly prediction, and 2) ensemble of concept drift detectors that use statistical-based drift detection mechanisms.

Result: Comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets shows VAE++ESDD significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods, particularly on datasets with severely/extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed VAE++ESDD method effectively addresses the challenges of anomaly detection in streaming data with concept drift and low anomaly rates through its two-level ensembling approach with incremental learning and statistical drift detection.

Abstract: In today's digital world, the generation of vast amounts of streaming data in various domains has become ubiquitous. However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: SWING introduces space walks for implicit network graphs, enabling graph computations without materializing the graph by performing walks in continuous spaces instead of on graph nodes, using Gumbel-softmax sampling with random features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many important graphs in machine learning (like ε-neighborhood graphs) are given implicitly through feature vectors rather than explicit adjacency structures. Computations on these implicit graphs typically require materializing the entire graph, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive.

Method: SWING performs walks in the continuous embedding spaces where graphs are defined, rather than on discrete nodes. It uses customized Gumbel-softmax sampling with linearized kernels via random features, coupled with importance sampling techniques to approximate original combinatorial computations.

Result: The algorithm is accelerator-friendly, does not require graph materialization, and connects implicitly defined graphs to Fourier analysis. Thorough experiments on different classes of i-graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: SWING provides a novel and efficient approach for computations on implicit graphs by leveraging continuous space walks and random feature techniques, opening new avenues for large-scale graph computations without explicit graph construction.

Abstract: We propose SWING: Space Walks for Implicit Network Graphs, a new class of algorithms for computations involving Graph Random Features on graphs given by implicit representations (i-graphs), where edge-weights are defined as bi-variate functions of feature vectors in the corresponding nodes. Those classes of graphs include several prominent examples, such as: $ε$-neighborhood graphs, used on regular basis in machine learning. Rather than conducting walks on graphs' nodes, those methods rely on walks in continuous spaces, in which those graphs are embedded. To accurately and efficiently approximate original combinatorial calculations, SWING applies customized Gumbel-softmax sampling mechanism with linearized kernels, obtained via random features coupled with importance sampling techniques. This algorithm is of its own interest. SWING relies on the deep connection between implicitly defined graphs and Fourier analysis, presented in this paper. SWING is accelerator-friendly and does not require input graph materialization. We provide detailed analysis of SWING and complement it with thorough experiments on different classes of i-graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap - producing equations that fit data well but violate fundamental scientific principles, due to being dominated by empirical risk minimization without explicit scientific consistency constraints.

Method: PG-SR uses a three-stage pipeline (warm-up, evolution, refinement) with a prior constraint checker that encodes domain priors as executable programs, and a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism that progressively steers discovery toward scientifically consistent regions.

Result: PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintains robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity, and theoretically reduces Rademacher complexity with tighter generalization bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed PG-SR framework successfully bridges the gap between data fitting and scientific consistency in symbolic regression, providing a principled approach to discover interpretable equations that align with domain priors while avoiding pseudo-equations.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable equations from observational data, with the potential to reveal underlying principles behind natural phenomena. However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.

We introduce QTabGAN, a hybrid quantum-classical generative adversarial framework for tabular data synthesis. QTabGAN is especially designed for settings where real data are scarce or restricted by privacy constraints. The model exploits the expressive power of quantum circuits to learn complex data distributions, which are then mapped to tabular features using classical neural networks. We evaluate QTabGAN on multiple classification and regression datasets and benchmark it against leading state-of-the-art generative models. Experiments show that QTabGAN achieves up to 54.07% improvement across various classification datasets and evaluation metrics, thus establishing a scalable quantum approach to tabular data synthesis and highlighting its potential for quantum-assisted generative modelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) treats decoding temperature as static or heuristically adapted, decoupled from task rewards. Temperature controls exploration-exploitation trade-off via policy entropy, but existing methods don't optimize it for task performance.

Method: Propose Introspective LLM: hierarchical RL framework where at each decoding step, model selects temperature based on hidden state, then samples next token from resulting distribution. Use coordinate ascent to jointly optimize temperature and token policies from downstream rewards.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines. Framework exhibits interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.

Conclusion: Sampling temperature should be learned as part of RLVR optimization rather than set statically. Learned temperature policies improve performance and yield interpretable exploration patterns that adapt to task uncertainty.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains large language models (LLMs) from sampled trajectories, making decoding strategy a core component of learning rather than a purely inference-time choice. Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.

TL;DR: PILNO enhances Laplace Neural Operator with physics-informed training using PDE residuals, virtual inputs for OOD generalization, and temporal-causality weighting for better time-dependent PDE handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure data-driven neural operators require extensive training data and generalize poorly in small-data regimes and out-of-distribution scenarios, needing physics-informed approaches for better efficiency and robustness.

Method: Proposes Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO) that enhances LNO with Advanced LNO backbone (ALNO) using FNO-style Fourier multiplier, physics residuals from PDEs/BCs/ICs, virtual inputs for broad spectral coverage, and temporal-causality weighting for time-dependent PDE optimization.

Result: PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (N_train ≤ 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger out-of-distribution generalization across four benchmarks (Burgers', Darcy flow, reaction-diffusion, forced KdV).

Conclusion: Physics-informed training with virtual inputs and temporal-causality weighting makes neural operators more data-efficient, robust, and generalizable, addressing key limitations of purely data-driven approaches for parametric PDE solving.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as fast surrogate solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.

### [86] [Geometric Manifold Rectification for Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13045)
*Xubin Wang,Qing Li,Weijia Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMR is a novel undersampling framework for imbalanced classification that uses geometric manifold rectification with asymmetric cleaning to protect minority samples while removing noisy majority samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced classification with noisy tabular data suffers from topological intrusion of majority class into minority manifold, obscuring decision boundaries. Traditional symmetric cleaning methods fail to capture local manifold structure and often remove informative minority samples.

Method: GMR uses geometric confidence estimation with inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with adaptive distance metric, combined with asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.

Conclusion: GMR provides a robust framework for handling imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors to better preserve minority manifold structure while cleaning noisy data.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification presents a formidable challenge in machine learning, particularly when tabular datasets are plagued by noise and overlapping class boundaries. From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.

*Jon Irureta,Gorka Azkune,Jon Imaz,Aizea Lojo,Javier Fernandez-Marques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Split-MoPE is a novel vertical federated learning framework that uses split learning with predefined mixture of experts to handle partial sample overlap without requiring full data alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance in one communication round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VFL frameworks assume full sample alignment which rarely exists in real-world scenarios, creating a gap between theory and practice that needs addressing.

Method: Integrates Split Learning with specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture where predefined experts process specific data alignments, uses pretrained encoders, and enables single-round communication.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art systems like LASER and Vertical SplitNN on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets, particularly in scenarios with high data missingness.

Conclusion: Split-MoPE provides an effective solution for practical VFL with partial sample alignment, offering communication efficiency, robustness against malicious participants, and per-sample interpretability.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for collaborative model training in privacy-sensitive domains such as finance and healthcare. However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness.

*Constantinos Tsakonas,Serena Ivaldi,Jean-Baptiste Mouret*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diverging Flows is a novel approach that enables flow matching models to simultaneously perform conditional generation and detect extrapolations by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models have an extrapolation hazard where they yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, leading to silent failures that are indistinguishable from valid predictions. This prevents deployment in safety-critical settings like medicine, robotics, and climate science.

Method: Diverging Flows enables a single model to perform both conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. The approach modifies the flow to diverge or become inefficient when encountering inputs outside the training distribution.

Result: The method achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. Evaluations on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Diverging Flows establishes a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in safety-critical domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.

Abstract: The ability of Flow Matching (FM) to model complex conditional distributions has established it as the state-of-the-art for prediction tasks (e.g., robotics, weather forecasting). However, deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by a critical extrapolation hazard: driven by smoothness biases, flow models yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, resulting in silent failures indistinguishable from valid predictions. In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADEPT framework transforms Speech LLMs into agentic systems that perform multi-turn emotion reasoning with evidence-grounded tools, shifting from consensus learning to ambiguity-aware emotion characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech LLMs produce ungrounded, text-biased emotion judgments without verifiable acoustic evidence, while speech encoders like WavLM provide strong acoustic representations but lack interpretability and emotion reasoning capabilities.

Method: Reframes emotion recognition as multi-turn inquiry process where an SLLM agent maintains evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes semantic/acoustic probing tools. Uses structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication with Group Relative Policy Optimization and Evidence Trust Gate.

Result: ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.

Conclusion: ADEPT successfully bridges the gap between SLLMs' reasoning capabilities and acoustic evidence grounding, enabling a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning that treats minority annotations as informative signals.

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) enable high-level emotion reasoning but often produce ungrounded, text-biased judgments without verifiable acoustic evidence. In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.

*Shuai Liu,Ning Cao,Yile Chen,Yue Jiang,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MobTA enables trajectory generation for new cities without access to their mobility data by using only source city data and public bus timetables, achieving near-target-finetuned performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory generation methods require at least some real mobility data from the target city, limiting their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. There's a need for zero-shot approaches that can generate trajectories for new cities without any mobility data.

Method: MobTA introduces task arithmetic into trajectory generation. It models parameter shifts from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in the source city, then applies this shift to the target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors, using only bus timetables from both cities and source city mobility data.

Result: Extensive experiments show MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves performance close to models fine-tuned using target city mobility trajectories. The approach also shows stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: MobTA successfully addresses the bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation problem, enabling effective trajectory generation for new cities without requiring their mobility data, opening possibilities for smart city applications in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Mobility trajectory data provide essential support for smart city applications. However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.

TL;DR: Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP) is an automatic structured pruning framework that compresses deep learning models for Time Series Classification without requiring manually tuned pruning ratios, achieving 58-75% compression while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep TSC models have high computational/memory requirements that limit deployment on resource-constrained devices. Existing structured pruning methods rely on manually tuned hyperparameters (like pruning ratios) which limit scalability and generalization across datasets.

Method: DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without predefined pruning ratios. It uses two stages: training with sparsity loss then automatic pruning based on activation patterns.

Result: On 128 UCR datasets using LITETime and InceptionTime architectures, DSP achieves average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm DSP produces compact and informative representations.

Conclusion: DSP offers a practical, fully automatic solution for compressing deep TSC models without manual hyperparameter tuning, enabling scalable and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving accuracy through intelligent filter selection.

Abstract: Deep learning models for Time Series Classification (TSC) have achieved strong predictive performance but their high computational and memory requirements often limit deployment on resource-constrained devices. While structured pruning can address these issues by removing redundant filters, existing methods typically rely on manually tuned hyperparameters such as pruning ratios which limit scalability and generalization across datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy. Redundancy analyses confirm that DSP produces compact and informative representations, offering a practical path for scalable and efficient deep TSC deployment.

TL;DR: Discrete latent representations (VQ-VAE/DVAE) enhance time series classification explainability by creating compressed, structured explanations without performance loss, validated by a new SSA metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for time series classification lacks explainability, and existing XAI methods struggle with high-dimensional, noisy raw data. The paper investigates whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations can enhance explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on informative patterns.

Method: Transform time series into discrete latent representations using Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE), then apply XAI methods to these compressed representations. Also propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric to quantitatively assess alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and label distribution in training data.

Result: Applying XAI methods to discrete latent representations leads to concise, structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. SSA provides systematic validation that XAI-highlighted features are truly representative of learned classification patterns.

Conclusion: Discrete latent representations not only retain essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly improved time series classification, yet the lack of explainability in these models remains a major challenge. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) addresses limitations of classical SR by incorporating temporal abstractions for stable features robust to policy changes, with NMF yielding sparse representations for efficient transfer and interpretable topological maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Successor Representation is policy-dependent and becomes obsolete when policies change due to learning, environmental non-stationarities, or changing task demands. It also suffers from spectral diffusion in topologically complex environments, leading to dense, overlapping features that scale poorly.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) that incorporates temporal abstractions into predictive representations. Applies non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to HSR to obtain sparse, low-rank state representations. This combination (HSR-NMF) discovers interpretable topological structures.

Result: HSR learns stable state features robust to task-induced policy changes. HSR-NMF yields sparse representations enabling highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. The approach discovers interpretable topological structures and provides policy-agnostic hierarchical maps. HSR's temporally extended structure can also drive efficient exploration in large, procedurally generated environments.

Conclusion: HSR overcomes classical SR limitations by providing stable, policy-agnostic hierarchical representations that bridge model-free optimality and model-based flexibility, enabling efficient transfer learning and exploration in complex environments.

Abstract: The successor representation (SR) provides a powerful framework for decoupling predictive dynamics from rewards, enabling rapid generalisation across reward configurations. However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework is proposed for understanding when message-passing graph neural networks can learn and generalize discrete algorithms from small training instances to arbitrary-sized inputs, with applications to shortest paths, MST, and dynamic programming problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to integrate algorithmic capabilities into neural pipelines, but existing work lacks formal guarantees about generalization from finite training sets, with most work being either empirical or focused solely on expressivity.

Method: A general theoretical framework characterizing sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn algorithms from small instances and approximate behavior on arbitrary-sized inputs, with extensions to more expressive architectures and refined analysis for specific algorithms.

Result: Proves sufficient conditions for algorithm learning, establishes impossibility results for certain algorithmic tasks with standard MPNNs, develops more expressive MPNN-like architectures, and refines analysis for Bellman-Ford algorithm with smaller required training sets and support for differentiable regularization.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for neural algorithmic reasoning with MPNNs, establishing both positive learning guarantees and limitations, while extending recent work through refined analysis and empirical support.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: F-LLM introduces a closed-loop feedback control system to autoregressive time series forecasting with LLMs, replacing naive open-loop generation to mitigate error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM-based forecasting uses open-loop autoregressive generation, causing exposure bias where early errors cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons.

Method: Reformulates autoregressive forecasting through control theory with F-LLM, a closed-loop framework featuring a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and feedback controller to stabilize trajectories.

Result: Theoretical guarantee of uniformly bounded error under local Lipschitz constraint; extensive experiments show significant error propagation mitigation and strong performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Feedback-driven closed-loop control effectively addresses error accumulation in LLM-based time series forecasting, offering theoretically sound and empirically validated improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional potential in time series forecasting, leveraging their inherent sequential reasoning capabilities to model complex temporal dynamics. However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-label causal feature selection methods operate at the label level, treating each label variable as monolithic and overlooking fine-grained causal mechanisms unique to individual categories.

Method: 1) Label category flattening decomposes label variables into specific category nodes for precise causal modeling. 2) Explanatory competition-based category-aware recovery mechanism uses SCSMI and DCSMI to salvage causal features obscured by label correlations. 3) Structural symmetry checks and cross-dimensional redundancy removal ensure robust and compact Markov Blankets.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show Ca-MCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving superior predictive accuracy with reduced feature dimensionality.

Conclusion: Ca-MCF effectively addresses limitations of label-level approaches by operating at the category level, enabling more precise causal feature selection in multi-label settings.

Abstract: Multi-label causal feature selection has attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, current methods primarily operate at the label level, treating each label variable as a monolithic entity and overlooking the fine-grained causal mechanisms unique to individual categories. To address this, we propose a Category-level Multi-label Causal Feature selection method named Ca-MCF. Ca-MCF utilizes label category flattening to decompose label variables into specific category nodes, enabling precise modeling of causal structures within the label space. Furthermore, we introduce an explanatory competition-based category-aware recovery mechanism that leverages the proposed Specific Category-Specific Mutual Information (SCSMI) and Distinct Category-Specific Mutual Information (DCSMI) to salvage causal features obscured by label correlations. The method also incorporates structural symmetry checks and cross-dimensional redundancy removal to ensure the robustness and compactness of the identified Markov Blankets. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets demonstrate that Ca-MCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving superior predictive accuracy with reduced feature dimensionality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MAUNet-Light, a lightweight neural network architecture for precipitation bias correction and spatial downscaling, developed using teacher-student learning from the original MAUNet model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite and climate model precipitation data often have systematic biases compared to ground measurements. While deep learning models like MAUNet have been effective for downscaling and bias correction, they come with high computational and memory requirements, making them less suitable for operational forecasting systems that need efficient solutions.

Method: The researchers adapt the MAUNet architecture for bias correction and introduce MAUNet-Light, a compact version using teacher-student learning. Knowledge is transferred from the trained MAUNet (teacher) to the lightweight MAUNet-Light (student) model, enabling both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational demands.

Result: MAUNet-Light achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models for both downscaling and bias correction of precipitation data, while significantly reducing computational requirements and memory usage compared to the original MAUNet architecture.

Conclusion: The teacher-student learning approach successfully enables the development of efficient, lightweight neural network models for operational weather forecasting applications. MAUNet-Light demonstrates that knowledge transfer can preserve accuracy while dramatically reducing computational costs for precipitation bias correction and downscaling tasks.

Abstract: Satellite-derived data products and climate model simulations of geophysical variables like precipitation, often exhibit systematic biases compared to in-situ measurements. Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed MAUNet-Light.The proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.

Motivation: Existing FCTN-based multi-dimensional data recovery methods have limitations in computational efficiency and modeling capability, needing improvements to handle large-scale data more effectively.

Method: Introduces FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization from gradient mapping perspective, formulates models for both unquantized and quantized observations, develops ADMM-based optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees, and employs randomized compression/sketching techniques for computational acceleration.

Result: Extensive numerical experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics, visual quality, and running time, with theoretical analysis providing approximation error bounds and convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed FCTN-based framework with nonconvex regularization and randomized compression provides an effective, scalable solution for multi-dimensional data recovery with improved computational efficiency and theoretical foundations.

Abstract: The recently proposed fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has demonstrated significant advantages in correlation characterization and transpositional invariance, and has achieved notable achievements in multi-dimensional data processing and analysis. However, existing multi-dimensional data recovery methods leveraging FCTN decomposition still have room for further enhancement, particularly in computational efficiency and modeling capability. To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework. Theoretical results on approximation error upper bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed method are derived. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and running time.

### [99] [Uncertainty in Federated Granger Causality: From Origins to Systemic Consequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13004)
*Ayush Mohanty,Nazal Mohamed,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First federated Granger causality method that quantifies uncertainty propagation, differentiating aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty and deriving closed-form uncertainty recursions with explicit convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated Granger causality algorithms only provide deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable causal inference in distributed applications like smart grids with data-sovereignty constraints.

Method: Systematically classify uncertainty sources (aleatoric vs epistemic), derive closed-form recursions for uncertainty evolution through client-server interactions, identify four novel cross-covariance components coupling data and parameter uncertainties, and establish rigorous convergence conditions with explicit steady-state variance formulas.

Result: Demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets show improved reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference through explicit uncertainty characterization.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty quantification methodology significantly enhances the reliability and interpretability of federated Granger causality, making it more robust for practical applications by explicitly modeling and propagating uncertainty throughout the federated architecture.

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) provides a rigorous framework for learning causal structures from time-series data. Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.

TL;DR: Machine learning classifiers using fMRI regional homogeneity can distinguish advanced concentration meditation states from non-meditative states with 66.8% accuracy, with prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions being most informative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced concentration meditation (ACAM-J) produces profound changes in consciousness and cognition, making it important to understand its neural correlates for insights into consciousness and well-being.

Method: Used fMRI regional homogeneity (ReHo) features from predefined brain regions to train machine learning classifiers. Trained on group-level fMRI from 20 advanced meditators, validated with intensive single-case data from one practitioner performing ACAM-J vs control tasks using stratified cross-validation.

Result: Ensemble models achieved 66.82% accuracy (p < 0.05) distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature importance analysis showed prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most. Moderate agreement (Cohen's kappa) supports feasibility.

Conclusion: Machine learning is feasible for classifying advanced meditation states, with potential applications for neuromodulation research and mechanistic models of meditation.

Abstract: Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.

TL;DR: Comparative study shows conditional diffusion models combined with weather ensembles produce the best probabilistic and point forecasts for wind power generation, significantly outperforming engineering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate probabilistic day-ahead wind power forecasts are essential for integrating renewable energy into the power grid, requiring evaluation of state-of-the-art machine learning methods against traditional engineering approaches.

Method: Comparative analysis of three probabilistic prediction methods (conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting, and conditional diffusion models) combined with gradient boosting trees using weather forecast ensembles, validated on four years of Belgian offshore wind farm data, with benchmarks against deterministic engineering methods using power curves and calibrated wake models.

Result: Machine learning methods improved mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to power curve and calibrated wake model respectively. Conditional diffusion models yielded the best overall probabilistic and point estimates, and using weather forecast ensembles improved point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.

Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models combined with weather forecast ensembles provide superior probabilistic and point forecasts for wind power generation, offering significant improvements over traditional engineering methods for grid integration.

Abstract: Accurate production forecasts are essential to continue facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This paper illustrates how to obtain probabilistic day-ahead forecasts of wind power generation via gradient boosting trees using an ensemble of weather forecasts. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model. Considering the three probabilistic prediction methods, the conditional diffusion model is found to yield the best overall probabilistic and point estimate of wind power generation. Moreover, the findings suggest that the use of an ensemble of weather forecasts can improve point forecast accuracy by up to 23%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A convex attention mechanism for wearable e-textiles achieves 100% accuracy with minimal parameters and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable e-textile interfaces need gesture recognition but face severe power, computation, and form factor constraints that make traditional deep learning impractical.

Method: Introduces a convexified attention mechanism using Euclidean projection onto probability simplex with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence. Implemented on a textile capacitive sensor with only 120-360 parameters.

Result: Achieves 100.00% accuracy on tap and swipe gestures with 10-fold cross-validation, uses 97% fewer parameters than conventional approaches, and has sub-millisecond inference (290-296μs) with <7KB storage.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that convex optimization enables efficient on-device machine learning for textile interfaces, though real-world deployment requires validation across more users and conditions.

Abstract: Wearable e-textile interfaces require gesture recognition capabilities but face severe constraints in power consumption, computational capacity, and form factor that make traditional deep learning impractical. While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$μ$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies. These results demonstrate how convex optimization can enable efficient on-device machine learning for textile interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust CRL approaches focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations which are important for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: 1) Introduces worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without explicitly modeling adversarial attackers. 2) Establishes dual-constraint defense mechanism on rewards to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability.

Result: TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across various CRL tasks.

Conclusion: TCRL provides an effective framework for handling temporally coupled perturbations in constrained reinforcement learning, advancing robust decision-making for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to optimize decision-making policies under constraint conditions, making it highly applicable to safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and power grid management. However, existing robust CRL approaches predominantly focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations. To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.

*Zhonghao Lyu,Ming Xiao,Mikael Skoglund,Merouane Debbah,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes quantization-aware collaborative inference for edge embodied AI systems to balance inference quality, latency, and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large AI models (LAIMs) are essential for embodied AI but their massive computational demands challenge resource-limited edge devices. There's a need to enable efficient deployment through quantization while maintaining inference quality.

Method: Developed a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion, derived lower/upper bounds on quantization rate-inference distortion function, and formulated joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design under delay/energy constraints.

Result: Extensive evaluations validate the distortion approximation, rate-distortion bounds, and joint design effectiveness. Simulations and real-world experiments show the approach successfully balances inference quality, latency, and energy consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed quantization-aware collaborative inference framework provides an effective solution for deploying large AI models on resource-constrained edge embodied AI systems while maintaining performance-energy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) are increasingly regarded as a core intelligence engine for embodied AI applications. However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.

### [106] [Backdoor Attacks on Contrastive Continual Learning for IoT Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13062)
*Alfous Tim,Kuniyilh Simi D*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contrastive continual learning in IoT is vulnerable to persistent backdoor attacks exploiting embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, requiring IoT-specific security measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT systems increasingly use continual learning to adapt to non-stationary environments, but contrastive continual learning introduces new security vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks that can persist through updates.

Method: Formalized objectives of embedding-level backdoor attacks, examined persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, developed layered taxonomy for IoT, compared vulnerabilities across learning paradigms, and evaluated defense strategies under IoT constraints.

Result: While contrastive continual learning enhances adaptive IoT intelligence, it elevates long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured against persistent backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: CCL is effective for IoT adaptation but requires IoT-specific security measures to address persistent backdoor vulnerabilities that exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement in constrained environments.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly depend on continual learning to adapt to non-stationary environments. These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.

*Juneyoung Park,Yuri Hong,Seongwan Kim,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MeSP introduces structured backpropagation that eliminates LoRA intermediate projection storage by recomputing it during backward pass, achieving 49% memory reduction compared to full backprop while maintaining exact gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device fine-tuning of LLMs faces severe memory constraints (6-12GB on mobile devices), forcing trade-offs between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO).

Method: Manually derive backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure; recompute intermediate projection h = xA during backward pass at minimal cost since rank r << d_in, eliminating storage need while maintaining mathematical equivalence.

Result: 49% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B-3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients; reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B. MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity ≈0.001).

Conclusion: MeSP bridges the gap between exact gradients and memory efficiency, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices while maintaining mathematical correctness.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving personalization of large language models, but mobile devices impose severe memory constraints, typically 6--12GB shared across all workloads. Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.

*Juneyoung Park,Eunbeen Yoon,Seongwan Kim. Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB) selectively computes gradients for a subset of transformer layers per training step, achieving speedup and improved stability compared to full backpropagation, with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) enables fine-tuning LLMs on mobile devices but requires full backward computation through all layers, where weight decompression alone consumes 32-42% of backward time. This overhead motivates a more efficient approach.

Method: LCSB computes gradients only for a subset of transformer layers per step, leveraging residual connections (which ensure gradient flow through identity paths) and AdamW momentum (which provides implicit updates for non-selected layers). The method is interpreted as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space.

Result: LCSB achieves up to 1.40× speedup with less than 2% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. In 4-bit quantized settings, it shows superior stability—for example, a 3B model that diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting implicit regularization.

Conclusion: LCSB provides an efficient, stable alternative to full backpropagation for fine-tuning LLMs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining quality and offering additional stability benefits in low-precision settings.

Abstract: Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\times$ speedup with less than 2\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.

TL;DR: GPH² is a unified graph pre-training method that works across both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs using multi-domain training with domain-specific expert encoding and adaptive expert fusion for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing graph pre-training methods are designed for either homogeneous OR heterogeneous graphs, but real-world applications often involve mixed graphs and distribution shifts between pre-training and deployment. This separation hinders unified graph modeling across diverse graph types.

Method: 1) Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs without explicit graph-type-specific designs. 2) Domain-specific expert encoding where each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge and shield from cross-domain discrepancies. 3) Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths for downstream tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that GPH² enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.

Conclusion: GPH² provides a unified approach to graph pre-training that bridges the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous graph methods, enabling effective transfer learning across diverse graph types and domains through its novel multi-domain expert encoding and fusion framework.

Abstract: Graph pre-training has achieved remarkable success in recent years, delivering transferable representations for downstream adaptation. However, most existing methods are designed for either homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs, thereby hindering unified graph modeling across diverse graph types. This separation contradicts real-world applications, where mixed homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous, and distribution shifts between upstream pre-training and downstream deployment are common. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \textbf{G}raph \textbf{P}re-training method across \textbf{H}omogeneous and \textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths. Extensive experiments on mixed graphs demonstrate that $\text{GPH}^{2}$ enables stable transfer across graph types and domains, significantly outperforming existing graph pre-training methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Diverse addresses the diversity illusion problem in self-play LLM reasoning frameworks by introducing persistent memory and skill-aware diversity measurement to sustain iterative improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-play frameworks like R-Zero suffer from non-sustained improvement due to Diversity Illusion, where training signals appear diverse but collapse into recurring patterns, preventing long-term skill expansion.

Method: Proposes R-Diverse with Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP) using persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM) evaluating diversity by reasoning skills rather than surface question variation.

Result: R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Addressing diversity illusions through persistent memory and skill-aware diversity measurement enables sustained iterative improvement in self-play LLM reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

*Mohamed Tarraf,Alex Chan,Alex Yakovlev,Rishad Shafik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Petri net framework for making Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) causally transparent and formally verifiable by modeling their operations as event-driven processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BNNs are difficult to explain, validate, and verify due to their discrete, highly non-linear behavior, making them opaque and unsuitable for safety-critical domains where causal transparency and behavioral guarantees are essential.

Method: Introduces a Petri net-based framework that captures BNN internal operations as event-driven processes. Creates modular PN blueprints for core BNN components (activation, gradient computation, weight updates) and composes them into a complete system-level model.

Result: Validates the composed PN against reference software-based BNN, verifies it against reachability and structural checks (1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion, correct-by-construction causal sequencing), and assesses scalability/complexity using Workcraft tools.

Conclusion: The framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification, addressing the opacity problem of BNNs for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a low-complexity and energy-efficient alternative to traditional full-precision neural networks by constraining their weights and activations to binary values. However, their discrete, highly non-linear behavior makes them difficult to explain, validate and formally verify. As a result, BNNs remain largely opaque, limiting their suitability in safety-critical domains, where causal transparency and behavioral guarantees are essential. In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By "eventizing" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft. Overall, this framework enables causal introspection of transparent and event-driven BNNs that are amenable to formal reasoning and verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Template-free methods treat retrosynthesis as black-box sequence generation limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. The key gap is that atom ordering in neural representations matters for capturing chemical reactions effectively.

Method: Proposes a structure-aware template-free framework encoding the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as positional inductive bias. Places reaction center atoms at the sequence head to transform implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns. Uses RetroDiT backbone - a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings to exploit this ordering. Combines with discrete flow matching to decouple training from sampling, enabling generation in 20-50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies show structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that proper atom ordering through positional inductive bias is crucial for efficient retrosynthesis learning. Structural priors combined with discrete flow matching enable high performance with significantly fewer parameters and steps compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of explicit encoding of chemical reaction structure over mere model scaling.

Abstract: Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data. Ablation studies further reveal that structural priors outperform brute-force scaling: a 280K-parameter model with proper ordering matches a 65M-parameter model without it.

*Pingzhi Li,Hongxuan Li,Zirui Liu,Xingcheng Lin,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashSchNet optimizes GNN-MD for GPU efficiency via IO-aware design with fused kernels, flash techniques, and quantization, achieving 6.5x speedup and 80% memory reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN potentials like SchNet improve molecular dynamics simulation accuracy but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. The missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware to optimize data movement between GPU memory hierarchies.

Method: FlashSchNet introduces four IO-aware techniques: (1) flash radial basis that fuses distance computation, Gaussian expansion, and envelope functions in a single tiled pass; (2) flash message passing that fuses cutoff, neighbor gathering, filter multiplication, and reduction; (3) flash aggregation using CSR segment reduce to minimize atomic writes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization of MLP weights exploiting low per-channel dynamic range.

Result: On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on a coarse-grained protein system (269 beads), achieving 6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory. It surpasses classical force fields like MARTINI while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.

Conclusion: IO-aware optimization is crucial for making GNN-MD competitive with classical force fields in terms of computational efficiency. FlashSchNet demonstrates that carefully accounting for GPU memory hierarchy through fused kernels, optimized data movement patterns, and quantization can dramatically improve GNN-MD performance while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) potentials such as SchNet improve the accuracy and transferability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by learning many-body interactions, but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.

*João Vitor Boer Abitante,Joana Meneguzzo Pasquali,Luan Fonseca Garcia,Ewerton de Oliveira,Thomas da Silva Paula,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA-based unlearning preserves model updates better than full-parameter fine-tuning when using aggressive 4-bit post-training quantization, maintaining utility while reducing privacy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When deploying unlearned LLMs, post-training quantization (PTQ) is needed for efficiency, but aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior.

Method: Propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that effective updates are preserved after quantization.

Result: On Llama-2-7B with MUSE dataset, LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points, yields higher 4-bit utility for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82), and substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ (PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86) while maintaining strong forgetting.

Conclusion: Using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment, as it preserves unlearning effects despite aggressive compression.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.

*Chendi Qian,Christopher Morris,Stefanie Jegelka,Christian Sohler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable message-passing neural network that combines approximation algorithm principles with neural networks for Uniform Facility Location, providing provable guarantees while outperforming classical approximation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based approaches for combinatorial optimization require supervised data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, which have computational overhead, unstable training, or lack provable guarantees. Classical approximation algorithms offer guarantees but are non-differentiable and can't adapt to input distributions.

Method: Develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles without needing solver supervision or discrete relaxations. The approach maintains provable approximation and size generalization guarantees.

Result: The approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. It also shows size generalization to larger instances than seen during training.

Conclusion: This work bridges learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization by creating differentiable models that combine neural network adaptability with algorithmic guarantees.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.

TL;DR: Neural networks embedded in PDEs can recover unknown functions from data, enabling parameter recovery and prediction generation for systems with unmeasurable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial differential equations often contain unknown functions that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, hampering our ability to derive predictions from the model. The paper aims to extend parameter recovery workflows from scalars to functions.

Method: Embed neural networks into PDEs and train them on data to approximate unknown functions with arbitrary accuracy. Use nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations as a case study to recover interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data.

Result: The approach successfully recovers interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data. Investigates how factors like number of available solutions, their properties, sampling density, and measurement noise affect function recovery.

Conclusion: The neural network embedding approach is advantageous because it can utilize standard parameter-fitting workflows, and the trained PDE can be treated as a normal PDE for purposes such as generating system predictions.

Abstract: Partial differential equations often contain unknown functions that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, hampering our ability to derive predictions from the model. Workflows for recovering scalar PDE parameters from data are well studied: here we show how similar workflows can be used to recover functions from data. Specifically, we embed neural networks into the PDE and show how, as they are trained on data, they can approximate unknown functions with arbitrary accuracy. Using nonlocal aggregation-diffusion equations as a case study, we recover interaction kernels and external potentials from steady state data. Specifically, we investigate how a wide range of factors, such as the number of available solutions, their properties, sampling density, and measurement noise, affect our ability to successfully recover functions. Our approach is advantageous because it can utilise standard parameter-fitting workflows, and in that the trained PDE can be treated as a normal PDE for purposes such as generating system predictions.

### [117] [Provably Convergent Actor-Critic in Risk-averse MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12386)
*Yizhou Zhang,Eric Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE) as a tractable solution concept for learning stationary policies in infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games, proposing a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm with global convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning stationary policies in infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games remains a fundamental open problem in MARL, as computing stationary forms of classic game-theoretic equilibria is computationally intractable, despite being more practical than time-dependent policies.

Method: The paper proposes a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm with a fast-timescale actor and slow-timescale critic, designed specifically to learn Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE) which incorporates both risk aversion and bounded rationality.

Result: The algorithm achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees by leveraging the strong regularity conditions of RQE, and empirical validation shows superior convergence properties compared to risk-neutral baselines in several environments.

Conclusion: RQE provides a tractable and practical solution concept for learning stationary policies in general-sum Markov games, overcoming the computational intractability of traditional equilibrium concepts while maintaining theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness.

Abstract: Learning stationary policies in infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games (MGs) remains a fundamental open problem in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). While stationary strategies are preferred for their practicality, computing stationary forms of classic game-theoretic equilibria is computationally intractable -- a stark contrast to the comparative ease of solving single-agent RL or zero-sum games. To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees. We empirically validate our algorithm in several environments to demonstrate superior convergence properties compared to risk-neutral baselines.

*Renjun Xu,Yang Yan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on the emerging paradigm of agent skills in LLMs, covering architecture, acquisition, deployment, security, and proposing a governance framework for trustworthy skill ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition from monolithic LLMs to modular, skill-equipped agents represents a fundamental shift in AI deployment, enabling dynamic capability extension without retraining. This survey aims to provide comprehensive coverage of this rapidly evolving agent skills landscape.

Method: The survey organizes the field along four axes: (1) architectural foundations including SKILL.md specification and progressive context loading, (2) skill acquisition through RL libraries, autonomous discovery, and compositional synthesis, (3) deployment at scale covering agent stacks, GUI grounding, and benchmarks, and (4) security analysis revealing vulnerabilities in community skills.

Result: Identifies seven open challenges including cross-platform portability and capability-based permissions, proposes a Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework (four-tier gate-based permission model), and provides a research agenda for trustworthy skill ecosystems. Empirical analysis reveals 26.1% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The agent skills abstraction layer represents a defining shift in LLM deployment, enabling dynamic capability extension through modular components. However, significant security and governance challenges exist, requiring systematic approaches to build trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems for next-generation agentic systems.

Abstract: The transition from monolithic language models to modular, skill-equipped agents marks a defining shift in how large language models (LLMs) are deployed in practice. Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the SKILL.md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries (SAGE), autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1\% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems. Unlike prior surveys that broadly cover LLM agents or tool use, this work focuses specifically on the emerging skill abstraction layer and its implications for the next generation of agentic systems.

### [119] [Theory of Mind Guided Strategy Adaptation for Zero-Shot Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12458)
*Andrew Ni,Simon Stepputtis,Stefanos Nikolaidis,Michael Lewis,Katia P. Sycara,Woojun Kim*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind to infer teammate intentions and select the best policy from an ensemble, improving zero-shot coordination in multi-agent RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot coordination in multi-agent RL requires agents to adapt to unseen teammates. Existing approaches focus on generating diverse training partners but then train a single best-response agent that converges to a static, generalist policy rather than learning adaptive, specialist policies that can achieve higher synergy.

Method: Proposes an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection: 1) infers teammate's intentions, 2) selects the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble. Evaluated in Overcooked environment under fully and partially observable settings.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate superiority over single best-response baseline in zero-shot coordination performance.

Conclusion: The adaptive ensemble approach using Theory-of-Mind for intention inference and policy selection effectively improves agent adaptation to unseen teammates in zero-shot coordination scenarios.

Abstract: A central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning is enabling agents to adapt to previously unseen teammates in a zero-shot fashion. Prior work in zero-shot coordination often follows a two-stage process, first generating a diverse training pool of partner agents, and then training a best-response agent to collaborate effectively with the entire training pool. While many previous works have achieved strong performance by devising better ways to diversify the partner agent pool, there has been less emphasis on how to leverage this pool to build an adaptive agent. One limitation is that the best-response agent may converge to a static, generalist policy that performs reasonably well across diverse teammates, rather than learning a more adaptive, specialist policy that can better adapt to teammates and achieve higher synergy. To address this, we propose an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection to first infer its teammate's intentions and then select the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble. We conduct experiments in the Overcooked environment to evaluate zero-shot coordination performance under both fully and partially observable settings. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over a single best-response baseline.

*Grant Douglas,Stephen Franklin,Claudia Szabo,Mingyu Guo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A modular framework for scaling proven small-team drone defense strategies to large adversarial swarms using dynamic programming decomposition and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defending against large adversarial drone swarms requires coordination methods that scale effectively beyond conventional multi-agent optimization, which struggles with computational complexity as team size increases.

Method: Proposes a framework that integrates effective small-team defense strategies as modular components, uses dynamic programming decomposition to assemble them into large teams in polynomial time, samples across multiple small-team candidates, and iteratively evaluates large-team outcomes while refining the pool of modular components.

Result: The framework scales to substantially larger scenarios while preserving effectiveness and reveals cooperative behaviors that direct optimization cannot reliably discover, demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: The partitioning approach provides an efficient way to construct scalable defenses against large adversarial drone swarms without exhaustive evaluation, enabling convergence on increasingly effective strategies through modular composition.

Abstract: Defending against large adversarial drone swarms requires coordination methods that scale effectively beyond conventional multi-agent optimisation. In this paper, we propose to scale strategies proven effective in small defender teams by integrating them as modular components of larger forces using our proposed framework. A dynamic programming (DP) decomposition assembles these components into large teams in polynomial time, enabling efficient construction of scalable defenses without exhaustive evaluation. Because a unit that is strong in isolation may not remain strong when combined, we sample across multiple small-team candidates. Our framework iterates between evaluating large-team outcomes and refining the pool of modular components, allowing convergence on increasingly effective strategies. Experiments demonstrate that this partitioning approach scales to substantially larger scenarios while preserving effectiveness and revealing cooperative behaviours that direct optimisation cannot reliably discover.
