It is a self-contained article and can be read independently of Part I. Although the authors have previously published related work, this submission is not a revision or updated version of any earlier paper", "summary": "The study of system complexity primarily has two objectives: to explore underlying patterns and to develop theoretical explanations. Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative \"evolutionary paths\" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM. Together, these methods offer causal insights into the dynamic evolution of systems. This part can help readers gain a preliminary understanding of the entire computational experiment method, laying the foundation for the subsequent study.", "AI": {"tldr": "Computational experiments address ABM's limitations by enabling counterfactual analysis through systematic variable manipulation for better causal inference in complex systems.", "motivation": "Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) focuses too much on simulation rather than experimentation, limiting its ability to uncover the fundamental operational principles governing complex systems.

An open-source microsimulation is used to project Ireland's population into the future where each individual is defined by a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The model is disaggregated spatially at the Electoral Division level, allowing for analysis of results at that, or any broader geographical scales. Ordinal regression is utilised to predict an individual's self-rated health based on their socio-economic characteristics and this method is shown to match well to Ireland's 2022 distribution of health statuses. Due to differences in the health status distributions of the health microdata and the national data, an alignment technique is proposed to bring predictions closer to real values. It is illustrated for one potential future population that the effects of an ageing population may outweigh other improvements in socio-economic outcomes to disimprove Ireland's mean self-rated health slightly. Health modelling at this kind of granular scale could offer local authorities a chance to predict and combat health issues which may arise in their local populations in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "A microsimulation approach using ordinal regression to predict future individual self-rated health in Ireland based on socio-economic characteristics, with spatial disaggregation and alignment techniques.", "motivation": "To forecast self-rated health in future populations for local authorities to anticipate and address potential health issues, considering factors like ageing effects.", "method": "Uses open-source microsimulation to project Ireland's population with demographic and socio-economic data, disaggregated spatially at Electoral Division level.

For one future scenario, ageing population effects slightly worsen mean self-rated health despite other socio-economic improvements.", "conclusion": "Granular health modeling can help local authorities predict and combat future health issues, with ageing being a key factor in health outcomes."}}
