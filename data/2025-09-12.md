### [1] [An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834)
*John T. Rickard,William A. Dembski,James Rickards*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends Bayes Theorem to handle interval range estimates from experts using interval type-2 fuzzy membership functions, providing a conservative method to avoid inconsistencies and a flexible encoding algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian inference assumes precise input values, which is unrealistic for real-world applications where subject matter experts often provide interval range estimates rather than precise probabilities.

Method: Developed an interval type-2 version of Bayes Theorem with a conservative method to avoid input inconsistencies, and created a novel algorithm for encoding expert-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy membership functions.

Result: The proposed approach enables Bayesian inference to work with interval-based expert knowledge while maintaining mathematical validity and avoiding potential inconsistencies that could produce invalid outputs.

Conclusion: The IT2 extension of Bayes Theorem provides a more realistic and practical framework for Bayesian inference in real-world applications where precise probability values are unavailable, leveraging expert interval estimates through fuzzy membership functions.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

### [3] [Global Constraint LLM Agents for Text-to-Model Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08970)
*Junyang Cai,Serdar Kadioglu,Bistra Dilkina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework that decomposes MiniZinc model generation by global constraint types, with specialized agents for each constraint class and an assembler to integrate them, showing better performance than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language descriptions of optimization problems are difficult to translate into correct MiniZinc models, requiring both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise that current approaches struggle with.

Method: Multiple specialized LLM agents each handle detection and code generation for specific global constraint types, with a final assembler agent integrating all constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model.

Result: Initial experiments show better performance compared to baseline methods like one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting across several LLMs.

Conclusion: The agentic approach effectively decomposes complex modeling tasks into simpler sub-tasks, reducing overall complexity and providing a promising framework for future enhancements in constraint modeling automation.

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

### [4] [ForTIFAI: Fending Off Recursive Training Induced Failure for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08972)
*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Azalia Mirhosseini,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE) loss function to mitigate model collapse in generative AI by reducing overconfidence in self-generated synthetic data, extending model fidelity by 2.3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the critical challenge of model collapse where AI performance degrades when repeatedly trained on synthetic data, which is projected to dominate training datasets by 2030.

Method: Introduces confidence-aware Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE) loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions during training to delay model collapse.

Result: TCE significantly delays model collapse in recursive training, extending model's fidelity interval before collapse by more than 2.3x, and generalizes across modalities.

Conclusion: Loss function design provides a simple yet powerful tool for preserving generative model quality in the era of increasing synthetic data usage.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

### [5] [Uncertainty Awareness and Trust in Explainable AI- On Trust Calibration using Local and Global Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08989)
*Carina Newen,Daniel Bodemer,Sonja Glantz,Emmanuel Müller,Magdalena Wischnewski,Lenka Schnaubert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes uncertainty explanations and global explanations in XAI, testing an algorithm's ability to calibrate trust and provide intuitive visual understanding despite complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in XAI research by focusing on uncertainty explanations and global explanations, which are often overlooked, and to develop general guidelines for XAI schemes.

Method: Selected an algorithm that simultaneously covers uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI concepts, then tested its trust calibration capabilities and evaluated whether complex visual explanations can enhance user satisfaction and interpretability.

Result: The study derived general guidelines for XAI schemes and evaluated the algorithm's performance in providing intuitive visual understanding and trust calibration.

Conclusion: Complex visual explanations, despite being difficult to understand, can potentially provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability in XAI systems when properly designed.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

### [6] [Instructional Prompt Optimization for Few-Shot LLM-Based Recommendations on Cold-Start Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09066)
*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a prompt formulation method for LLM-based recommender systems to address cold-start user issues by optimizing instructional prompts with few-shot learning and context-conditioned approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cold-start user problem limits recommender system effectiveness due to lack of historical behavioral data, requiring innovative approaches to leverage LLMs for recommendation tasks.

Method: Proposes P(u, Ds) → R̂ formulation where u is cold-start user profile, Ds is curated support set. Uses transformer-based LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4) with token-level alignments, embedding space regularization, and optimal exemplar injection with structured instructions.

Result: Empirical evidence shows significant improvements in precision@k and NDCG scores in low-data settings. Demonstrates that prompt composition controls attention scales and decoder behavior during inference.

Conclusion: Prompt-based adaptation is an effective approach for addressing cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines, showing that timely composition is both syntactic and functional.

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

### [7] [Understanding Economic Tradeoffs Between Human and AI Agents in Bargaining Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071)
*Crystal Qian,Kehang Zhu,John Horton,Benjamin S. Manning,Vivian Tsai,James Wexler,Nithum Thain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of humans, LLMs, and Bayesian agents in dynamic negotiation tasks shows performance parity can mask fundamental behavioral differences critical for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As coordination tasks shift from humans to autonomous agents, it's crucial to evaluate not just performance outcomes but also the negotiation processes and behavioral dynamics in multi-agent environments.

Method: Compared humans (N=216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in identical dynamic negotiation conditions, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics.

Result: Bayesian agents achieved highest surplus through aggressive optimization but with frequent rejections. Humans and LLMs achieved similar overall surplus but through different behaviors: LLMs favored conservative concessionary trades, while humans used more strategic, risk-taking, fairness-oriented approaches.

Conclusion: Performance parity alone is insufficient for agent evaluation - fundamental differences in process and alignment are critical considerations for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for
Management and Innovation (IMI) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
Competition. The dataset included 195,789 customer IDs, and we employed a
16-step design and statistical analysis to ensure the final pipeline was
robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second
place in the competition.

### [9] [Mind Meets Space: Rethinking Agentic Spatial Intelligence from a Neuroscience-inspired Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09154)
*Bui Duc Manh,Soumyaratna Debnath,Zetong Zhang,Shriram Damodaran,Arvind Kumar,Yueyi Zhang,Lu Mi,Erik Cambria,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neuroscience-inspired computational framework for agentic spatial intelligence, identifying six essential modules to bridge the gap between current AI systems and human-like spatial reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems have limited spatial reasoning abilities compared to human spatial intelligence, which is critical for effective interaction with the physical 3D world. The gap needs to be addressed to advance autonomous systems.

Method: The authors introduce a computational framework with six neuroscience-grounded modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. They analyze existing methods against this framework and identify gaps.

Result: The paper provides a structured perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning across virtual and physical environments, along with analysis of benchmarks, datasets, and application domains like robotics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a neuroscience-grounded pathway for developing more advanced spatial reasoning capabilities in AI systems, with potential applications in dynamic and unstructured environments. The work aims to benefit the research community with structured guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

*Xing Gao,Zherui Huang,Weiyao Lin,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProgD: A progressive multi-scale decoding strategy with dynamic heterogeneous graphs for multi-agent motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent prediction methods overlook the evolving nature of social interactions between agents, which is crucial for accurate motion prediction in autonomous vehicles.

Method: Uses dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling to capture evolving social interactions, with a progressive modeling approach that eliminates uncertainty in future motions through a factorized architecture and multi-scale decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark and performing well on the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed ProgD framework effectively addresses the limitation of evolving social interactions in multi-agent prediction and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address governance and accountability challenges posed by unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities of LLM-powered autonomous agents in various domains including finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing.

Method: Proposes a blockchain-enabled three-layer architecture (agent layer, blockchain data layer, regulatory application layer) with three key modules: agent behavior tracing and arbitration, dynamic reputation evaluation, and malicious behavior forecasting.

Result: Establishes a systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective governance for multi-agent collaboration and identifies future research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in autonomous agent systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves LLM performance on multi-step data analysis tasks, demonstrating better generalization and stronger tool-use reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG approaches struggle with thematic and holistic understanding of complex texts, requiring deeper analysis of both text and context that knowledge graphs can provide.

Method: Comprehensive technical comparative study evaluating three open-source methodologies for constructing knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with LLMs for question answering.

Result: Experimental results show OpenIE provides the most comprehensive triplet coverage, while GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities among the three methods.

Conclusion: Discussion of strengths/limitations of each method with insights for future directions in improving knowledge graph-based question answering systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using MCTS trajectories to improve policy optimization in preference-based RL via staged GRPO training with tree-structured advantage estimation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage MCTS-derived trajectories (effective in math/symbolic reasoning) to enhance policy optimization in preference-based RL, moving beyond traditional value/reward model training

Method: Staged GRPO training paradigm using partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing tree-structured advantage estimation and prefix-conditioned reward signals

Result: Structured advantage estimation stabilizes updates and better reflects compositional reasoning quality, but faces challenges like advantage saturation and reward signal collapse

Conclusion: Proposed heuristic and statistical solutions mitigate issues, but open challenges remain for learning under staged/tree-like reward structures

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

### [16] [Explaining Tournament Solutions with Minimal Supports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09312)
*Clément Contet,Umberto Grandi,Jérôme Mengin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies certified explanations for tournament winners by identifying minimal sub-tournaments where a candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of the rest of the tournament structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide formal, certified explanations for why certain candidates win tournaments under various rules, addressing a central concept in explainable AI by finding minimal supports that guarantee a candidate's victory.

Method: The authors identify minimal supports (sub-tournaments) where a candidate is a necessary winner, analyze common tournament solutions (top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland, Borda, maximin, weighted uncovered set), determine smallest support sizes, and develop polynomial-time algorithms for computation.

Result: For all tournament rules except the weighted uncovered set, polynomial-time algorithms were developed to compute minimal supports. The problem was shown to be NP-complete for the weighted uncovered set.

Conclusion: Minimal supports provide compact, certified, and intuitive explanations for tournament winners, offering a formal approach to explainable AI in tournament settings across various common tournament rules.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

### [17] [Measuring Implicit Spatial Coordination in Teams: Effects on Collective Intelligence and Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09314)
*Thuy Ngoc Nguyen,Anita Williams Woolley,Cleotilde Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines how spatial coordination dimensions (exploration diversity, movement specialization, adaptive proximity) affect team performance in search/rescue tasks with restricted communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many teams (firefighters, military, emergency response) must coordinate movements without visual cues or extensive communication, but existing research focuses mainly on co-located or knowledge work coordination.

Method: Analyzed data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) performing specialized roles in collaborative online search/rescue tasks with restricted explicit communication, measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and movement alignment.

Result: Spatial specialization positively predicts performance; adaptive spatial proximity shows marginal inverted U-shaped relationship (moderate adaptation optimal); temporal dynamics differentiate high- vs low-performing teams over time.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork, highlighting importance of balanced adaptive strategies for training and AI-assisted team support systems.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based ML agents are limited in task coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing to capture full capabilities in realistic settings.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system collecting ML challenges from platforms like Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata; 2) Leaderboard-driven difficulty modeling using participant counts and score dispersion; 3) Multi-dimensional evaluation framework assessing performance, format compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization.

Result: Created three benchmark subsets (Lite, Medium, Full) based on 150 curated AutoML tasks, with the Lite version (18 tasks) providing balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty levels for practical daily benchmarking.

Conclusion: TAM Bench provides a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark that enables comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML workflows across multiple task types and data modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

*Abdel Hakim Drid,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi,Abderrezzak Debilou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel DRL architecture with VLM integration and curriculum learning for resource-efficient semantic exploration, achieving higher object discovery rates and strategic VLM querying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL approaches struggle with balancing efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities in small policies, requiring human intervention for semantic exploration tasks.

Method: Integration of Vision-Language Model common-sense through layered reward function, modeling VLM query as dedicated action for strategic resource conservation, combined with curriculum learning for robust training at different complexity levels.

Result: Significantly enhanced object discovery rates, learned capability to navigate towards semantically rich regions, and strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning in autonomous agents, enabling fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot prompting approaches heavily depend on provided examples, limiting model's inherent reasoning capabilities and requiring costly task-specific prompt construction.

Method: Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO) elicits models to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without manual few-shot examples.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLM benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Conclusion: TORSO provides an effective alternative to few-shot prompting that leverages models' internal reasoning capabilities without task-specific manual example construction.

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEDM is a self-evolving distributed memory framework that transforms memory from passive storage to an active, self-optimizing component for multi-agent systems, improving reasoning accuracy while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory management methods for multi-agent systems suffer from noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited cross-domain generalization, necessitating a more efficient and scalable solution.

Method: SEDM integrates verifiable write admission using reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries based on utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion for abstracting reusable insights.

Result: Evaluations show SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared to baseline methods, and enables knowledge transfer from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: SEDM represents a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration, transforming memory into an active, self-optimizing component rather than just passive storage.

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of compositional generalization in current AI tools like vision-language models, building on previous negative results with classical tensor-based semantics by leveraging quantum computing advantages.

Method: Interpreted compositional tensor-based models in Hilbert spaces and trained Variational Quantum Circuits on image captioning tasks. Used two encoding techniques: multi-hot encoding on binary image vectors and angle/amplitude encoding on CLIP image vectors.

Result: Achieved good proof-of-concept results with noisy multi-hot encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was mixed but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Quantum models demonstrate improved performance for compositional generalization tasks compared to classical approaches, showing potential for quantum advantage in AI language-vision applications.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequential computation patterns in embodied AI systems face limitations in achieving the necessary thinking frequency for real-world applications due to high-frequency input/output demands in dynamic environments.

Method: Auras disaggregates perception and generation modules and provides controlled pipeline parallelism between them. It establishes a public context for both modules to share to address data staleness issues that arise from increased parallelism.

Result: Experimental results show Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating effective high-throughput performance without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Auras successfully overcomes the constraints of sequential computation in embodied AI systems by providing a co-designed framework that enables high and stable throughput while maintaining accuracy through shared context management.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

### [25] [The Illusion of Diminishing Returns: Measuring Long Horizon Execution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09677)
*Akshit Sinha,Arvindh Arun,Shashwat Goel,Steffen Staab,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Larger LLMs show exponential improvements in long-horizon task completion despite diminishing single-step accuracy gains. Execution errors, not reasoning failures, cause breakdowns in longer tasks. Models exhibit self-conditioning where prior errors increase future mistakes, which doesn't improve with scaling alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail at simple tasks when made longer, despite excelling at complex reasoning, and to investigate whether continued model scaling yields diminishing returns for real-world agent performance.

Method: Isolate execution capability by providing explicit knowledge and plans for long-horizon tasks. Compare performance across model sizes, analyze per-step accuracy degradation, and examine self-conditioning effects where models become more error-prone when context contains prior mistakes.

Result: Larger models correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have 100% single-turn accuracy. Per-step accuracy degrades with increasing steps due to self-conditioning effects. Thinking models don't self-condition and can execute much longer tasks in single turns.

Conclusion: Execution capability, not reasoning, is the limiting factor for long-horizon tasks. Scaling model size and sequential test-time compute provides massive benefits for task length completion. Self-conditioning persists despite scaling, highlighting the importance of execution-focused improvements.

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes CT-MARL framework using physics-informed neural networks to solve continuous-time multi-agent reinforcement learning, addressing curse of dimensionality and value function approximation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continuous-time RL methods are limited to single-agent domains due to curse of dimensionality in HJB equations and difficulty in approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings.

Method: Uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions, with Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module to align value learning with value-gradient learning and improve gradient fidelity.

Result: Outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines on continuous-time variants of multi-agent particle environment and multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks, scaling to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed CT-MARL framework with PINNs and VGI successfully addresses key challenges in continuous-time multi-agent reinforcement learning, enabling effective scaling to complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven framework called DRSALife for learning Soft Artificial Life models from observed reaction-diffusion system data without prior physics knowledge, achieving 74% accuracy in predicting emergent dynamics and showing robustness to noise and sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of system identification in reaction-diffusion systems when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics, particularly for discovering emergent dynamics across various fields like neuroscience, ecology, and epidemiology.

Method: Uses the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model to learn Soft ALife rulesets (Agent-based and Cellular Automata models) from observed data, testing on systems including Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems.

Result: The learned models achieve 74% accuracy in predicting emergent dynamics and demonstrate robust performance against Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity. The framework successfully identifies the structure and parameters of underlying PDEs representing these dynamics.

Conclusion: The DRSALife framework is effective for learning Soft ALife rulesets from data without prior physics knowledge, providing accurate predictions of emergent dynamics in reaction-diffusion systems and showing resilience to noisy and sparse datasets.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current additive uncertainty decomposition approaches have been questioned, and there's a need for better per-sample uncertainty quantification for high-risk decision-making applications.

Method: Uses signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model predictions, introduces variance-gated measure that scales predictions by confidence factor derived from ensembles.

Result: Develops an intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition, provides analysis of diversity collapse in committee machines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more effective approach to uncertainty quantification and decomposition compared to traditional additive methods, with practical implications for ensemble-based uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

*Weiyuan Gong,Tongyang Li,Xinzhao Wang,Zhiyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improved matrix multiplicative weight update algorithm achieves instance-optimal regret bound O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d))) for matrix learning from expert advice, matching MMWU's computational complexity while providing better performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret but not instance-optimal regret. There is room for improvement by developing algorithms that adapt to specific problem instances while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Developed a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA, with MMWU as a special case. Used a new one-sided Jensen's trace inequality based on Laplace transform to enable application of general potential functions. Derived optimal potential function from vector LEA problem using imaginary error function.

Result: Achieved instance-optimal regret bound O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d))) with same computational complexity as MMWU. Outperformed state-of-the-art in quantum learning applications including learning depolarized quantum states, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. Enabled prediction of nonlinear quantum properties.

Conclusion: The improved algorithm provides instance-optimal regret guarantees without additional computational cost, making the improvement 'free'. The framework and techniques enable better performance in quantum learning applications and prediction of nonlinear quantum properties.

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

*Sreejeet Maity,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust Q-learning algorithm for adversarial reward corruption with finite-time convergence guarantees matching non-adversarial rates up to unavoidable corruption term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical RL algorithms like Q-learning degrade severely under adversarial reward corruption from noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks.

Method: Proposed provably robust Q-learning variant that handles adversarial corruption, with analysis under asynchronous sampling and time-correlated data. Also developed a variant requiring no prior knowledge of reward statistics using refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality.

Result: Achieved finite-time convergence rate matching non-adversarial case up to additive corruption term, with information-theoretic lower bound showing this term is unavoidable.

Conclusion: First finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning in adversarial settings, bridging significant gap in robust reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization framework to improve worst-group performance in ML models by accounting for distributional uncertainty within groups, with a gradient descent-ascent algorithm and real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML methods often learn spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for atypical or underrepresented groups in heterogeneous data environments. Prior worst-group optimization approaches assume accurate group distribution estimation, which is frequently violated in noisy, non-stationary environments.

Method: Develops a novel framework using Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to account for distributional uncertainty within each group while preserving worst-group performance objectives. Implements a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to solve the DRO problem.

Result: The method provides convergence results and is validated on real-world data, demonstrating effectiveness in handling distributional uncertainty while improving worst-group performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Wasserstein DRO framework successfully addresses distributional uncertainty in group-wise optimization, providing robust performance improvements for underrepresented groups in heterogeneous data environments with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LRP attribution methods by representing them as modified gradient matrices, derives bounds for singular values and attribution values, and finds that LRP-beta has weight-norm-independent constants unlike gradient methods and LRP-epsilon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the numerical properties and distribution characteristics of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) attribution methods through mathematical analysis of their matrix representations.

Method: Represent LRP-type attribution methods as products of modified gradient matrices, derive upper bounds for singular values and component-wise bounds for attribution values, and analyze convergence constants.

Result: Found that LRP-beta has multiplicative constants that remain independent of weight norms, unlike gradient-based methods and LRP-epsilon, which has implications for data augmentation and Smoothgrad-type methods.

Conclusion: The analysis provides mathematical foundations for understanding LRP attribution methods, revealing important distinctions between different variants (LRP-beta vs LRP-epsilon) and their behavior compared to gradient-based approaches.

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

TL;DR: Carbon-aware federated learning scheduler that uses slack time and fair allocation to reduce emissions while maintaining model accuracy, especially effective under tight carbon constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale ML training produces substantial carbon emissions. Federated Learning's distributed nature enables leveraging regional carbon intensity variations to reduce environmental impact.

Method: Carbon-aware client selection and scheduling that: 1) Uses slack time to defer training to low-carbon periods, 2) Implements α-fair carbon allocation among clients, 3) Includes global fine-tuning phase to address statistical heterogeneity and selection bias.

Result: Outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across various carbon budgets with strongest gains under tight carbon constraints using real-world carbon intensity data.

Conclusion: Carbon-aware scheduling in FL effectively reduces emissions while maintaining performance, with slack time and fair allocation being key components for balancing environmental and accuracy objectives.

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines optimization algorithms with explainable AI techniques to solve multi-objective polymer design problems while maintaining interpretability for domain experts.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Motivation: Standard transformers suffer from quadratic time complexity that limits scalability, despite having the representational capacity to simulate Massively Parallel Computation algorithms.

Method: Introduces Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) mechanism with sub-quadratic time complexity, and proves its capabilities within the MPC framework.

Result: ANNA-transformers retain expressive power of standard attention, can solve reasoning tasks like Match2 and k-hop with near-optimal depth, and can simulate constant-depth low-rank transformers.

Conclusion: ANNA provides a unified framework for efficient attention approximations while maintaining theoretical guarantees and practical scalability.

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively

attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

TL;DR: A context-conditional anomaly detection framework for tabular data that automatically identifies context features and uses deep autoencoders to model conditional distributions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised anomaly detection in tabular data is challenging because real-world datasets contain heterogeneous contexts where globally rare events can be normal under specific contexts, making single global distribution models ineffective.

Method: Proposes a framework that automatically identifies context features and models conditional data distribution using deep autoencoders, specifically tailored for tabular datasets with heterogeneous contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating superior anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses contextual nuances in tabular data anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of considering context features for accurate distinction between normal and anomalous instances.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in data-driven weather models has plateaued, and there's a need for more accurate forecasting without developing entirely new models from scratch.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer-based gating network to dynamically weight contributions of multiple expert weather models at each grid point, conditioned on forecast lead time.

Result: Achieves up to 10% lower RMSE than best-performing AI weather model on 2-day forecasts, outperforming individual experts and simple averaging.

Conclusion: MoWE provides computationally efficient and scalable strategy to advance weather prediction by optimally combining existing high-quality forecast models.

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Motivation: Renewable energy integration challenges conventional protection schemes, requiring ML solutions that need better validation and standardization.

Method: Scoping review following PRISMA framework, analyzing 100+ publications to assess ML scope, performance, and suitability for evolving grid conditions.

Result: ML models show high accuracy in simulations but lack real-world validation; literature is fragmented with inconsistent methodologies and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Critical gaps include real-world validation and robustness testing; future research needs benchmark datasets, realistic validation, and advanced ML architectures for practical deployment.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

TL;DR: STRIDE is a scalable XAI framework that uses RKHS functional decomposition to avoid exponential subset enumeration costs and provides functional components instead of single scalar attributions, achieving 3x median speedup with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current XAI frameworks: exponential computational cost from feature subset enumeration and reduced expressiveness of scalar value summaries.

Method: Uses orthogonal functional decomposition in RKHS with analytical projection via recursive kernel-centering procedure, avoiding explicit subset enumeration. Model-agnostic for tabular data with local/global views.

Result: Achieved 0.6-9.7x speedups (median ~3x) across 10 datasets with high fidelity (R² 0.81-0.999) and good rank agreement. Enables novel diagnostics like 'component surgery'.

Conclusion: STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by providing structured functional perspective, offering both computational efficiency and richer explanatory capabilities.

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

TL;DR: The Rashomon Ensemble method strategically selects diverse high-performing models from the Rashomon set to improve generalization and robustness to distribution shifts, achieving up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of model selection for generalization when multiple models perform similarly well (Rashomon Effect) in real-world scenarios like manufacturing and medical diagnosis.

Method: Grouping models based on both performance and explanations to construct ensembles that maximize diversity while maintaining predictive accuracy, ensuring each model covers distinct regions of the solution space.

Result: Validated on real-world datasets with up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements, particularly effective when Rashomon ratio is large, demonstrating robustness and practical business benefits.

Conclusion: The Rashomon Ensemble approach effectively leverages model diversity to create more robust ensembles that generalize better to unseen data and distribution shifts.

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: To establish a foundation for thermodynamic description of learning processes by studying the Riemannian geometry of Deep Linear Networks.

Method: Uses group actions to analyze overparametrization, Riemannian submersion from parameter space to observable space, and constructs orthonormal basis for tangent space using Jacobi matrices theory.

Result: Demonstrates foliation of balanced manifold by group orbits to define Boltzmann entropy, and shows Riemannian geometry on observable space is obtained via submersion of balanced manifold.

Conclusion: The approach provides geometric foundations for thermodynamic analysis of learning processes in deep linear networks through Riemannian geometry and group theory methods.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a

tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to specialized tasks in resource-constrained environments is challenging. Traditional LoRA's uniform rank allocation and existing rank allocation techniques are computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering practical applications.

Method: Proposes Sensitivity-LoRA that dynamically allocates ranks to weight matrices based on both global and local sensitivities using second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to capture weight sensitivity with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA provides an optimal rank allocation approach that addresses the limitations of traditional LoRA methods, offering improved computational efficiency and stability for LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

*Emam Hossain,Md Osman Gani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates MVGC and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability in Arctic sea ice forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ML/DL models rely on correlation-based learning which fails to distinguish genuine causal relationships from spurious associations, limiting robustness and generalization.

Method: Hybrid neural architecture integrating Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection, using 43 years of Arctic Sea Ice Extent data and ocean-atmospheric variables.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and interpretability across varying lead times, with reduced unnecessary features and enhanced computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic, high-dimensional domains, offering scalable causality-informed predictive modeling that advances both theoretical foundations and practical performance.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

*Md Ibrahim Ibne Alam,Ankur Senapati,Anindo Mahmood,Murat Yuksel,Koushik Kar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning model using XGBoost achieves 98% accuracy in predicting ISP peering relationships using public data from PeeringDB and CAIDA, enabling automated peering partner selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate the lengthy and complex peering process between ISPs to enhance efficiency in global Internet connectivity by predicting optimal peering partnerships.

Method: Gathered ISP data from public databases (PeeringDB, CAIDA), evaluated three ML model types (tree-based, neural networks, transformers), with XGBoost performing best.

Result: XGBoost model achieved 98% accuracy in predicting peering relationships and demonstrated resilience to temporal, spatial variations and missing data.

Conclusion: ISPs can adopt this ML-based approach to fully automate peering partner selection, leading to a more efficient and optimized Internet ecosystem.

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

*Maria Risques,Kratika Bhagtani,Amit Kumar Singh Yadav,Edward J. Delp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HISPASpoof is the first large-scale Spanish dataset for synthetic speech detection and attribution, addressing the gap in Spanish speech forensics where existing English-trained detectors fail to generalize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spanish is spoken by over 600 million people but remains underrepresented in speech forensics research, while zero-shot voice cloning and TTS technologies pose serious misuse concerns that need detection capabilities.

Method: Created HISPASpoof dataset with real speech from public corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated using six zero-shot TTS systems, then evaluated five representative detection methods.

Result: Detectors trained on English failed to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof substantially improved detection performance. The dataset also enabled evaluation of synthetic speech attribution (identifying generation methods).

Conclusion: HISPASpoof provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish, addressing the significant gap in Spanish-language synthetic speech detection capabilities.

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

*Omar Erak,Omar Alhussein,Hatem Abou-Zeid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training-free adaptive token merging for vision transformers in semantic communication, using Bayesian optimization to balance accuracy and computational efficiency across varying channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large transformer models are powerful for semantic communication but computationally intensive, making deployment challenging in resource-constrained 6G networks.

Method: Formulate token merging proportions as multi-objective optimization problem, use Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to create Pareto frontier of optimal configurations for adaptive runtime adjustment.

Result: Method consistently outperforms baselines, achieves significant FLOPs reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across various SNR conditions, enables effective adaptive policies for channel quality response.

Conclusion: Provides scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems with flexible trade-offs between latency and semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO is a sequence-level RL method that addresses length bias in LLM training by introducing length-fair clipping in importance-sampling weight space, using a Gaussian-motivated approach that scales with sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is applied to sequences - fixed clip ranges systematically reweight short vs long responses, distorting the effective objective and creating length bias.

Method: FSPO clips sequence log-importance-sampling ratios with a band that applies KL-corrected drift term and scales as √L (square root of sequence length), ensuring length-fair clipping directly in IS weight space.

Result: Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across different length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baseline methods across multiple evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed FSPO method successfully addresses length fairness issues in sequence-level RL for LLMs through theoretically-grounded length-aware clipping, improving training stability and performance.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

*Md Tanveer Hossain Munim*

TL;DR: DART framework addresses the Statistical Similarity Trap in weather forecasting by using dual-decoder architecture to improve extreme convection detection, achieving 270% improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a 'Statistical Similarity Trap' that rewards blurry predictions while missing rare, high-impact extreme weather events like dangerous convection.

Method: DART (Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks) employs dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition, physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions to transform coarse atmospheric forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields optimized for extreme convection detection.

Result: DART achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent CSI, shows 270% improvement in extreme convection detection by removing Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT Paradox), and validates performance with real-world case study of August 2023 Chittagong flooding disaster.

Conclusion: DART provides the first systematic solution for hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling tasks in weather forecasting, enabling precise operational calibration, fast training (under 10 minutes), and seamless integration with existing meteorological workflows for trustworthy AI in extreme weather preparedness.

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP3O is a novel constrained RL algorithm that uses adaptive incentives and progressive penalties to stabilize training near constraint boundaries, outperforming state-of-the-art safe RL methods with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained RL faces challenges in balancing reward maximization with constraint satisfaction, particularly instability near constraint boundaries that leads to suboptimal performance in continuous control settings.

Method: Proposes Incrementally Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O) which integrates adaptive incentive mechanisms and progressively increasing penalties to stabilize training dynamics before approaching constraint boundaries.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark environments demonstrates IP3O's efficacy compared to state-of-the-art Safe RL algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on worst-case optimality error bounds.

Conclusion: IP3O effectively addresses constraint boundary instability in constrained RL through adaptive incentives and progressive penalties, providing both empirical performance improvements and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

TL;DR: Study identifies key indicators for agro-tourism growth using machine learning feature selection methods, with LASSO combined with Logistic Regression achieving 98-99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agro-tourism is a strategic economic model for rural development that needs detailed study of growth strategies and important indicators to support farmers' income diversification and cultural heritage conservation.

Method: Two-phase study: comprehensive literature review to identify indicators, then machine learning feature selection techniques (LASSO) combined with classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) on 70-30% and 80-20% train-test data splits.

Result: LASSO with Logistic Regression achieved highest accuracy: 98% in 70-30% data split and 99% in 80-20% split. Random Forest followed with 95% accuracy in 70-30% split, while Decision Trees and XGBoost achieved 97% accuracy in 80-20% split.

Conclusion: Machine learning feature selection methods, particularly LASSO combined with Logistic Regression, are effective for identifying key indicators and predicting agro-tourism growth with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for strategic development.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

*Jakob Nyberg,Pontus Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vejde framework combines data abstraction, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning to create inductive policy functions for decision problems with structured states, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen problem instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decision problems with richly structured states (object classes and relations) and create policies that can generalize across problems of varying size and structure.

Method: Represents MDP states as databases of facts, converts states to bipartite graphs, uses neural message passing for latent state mapping, and employs both supervised and reinforcement learning for policy training.

Result: Vejde policies generalized well to unseen test instances without significant score loss, performing close to instance-specific MLP agents on average across eight problem domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully produces inductive policy functions that handle structured state problems and generalize effectively to new problem instances, demonstrating the viability of combining graph neural networks with reinforcement learning for structured decision problems.

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

*Haipeng Liu,Ting Long,Jing Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSim is a QA simulator that distills LLM knowledge to improve prediction of student response correctness, achieving strong performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent harmful recommendations from undertrained educational recommender systems by creating better QA simulators that can generate training data without interacting with real students.

Method: Proposes LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim) which distills domain knowledge and reasoning capability from large language models to enhance prediction performance while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show LDSim achieves strong results on both simulation tasks and knowledge tracing tasks, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: LDSim effectively bridges the gap between LLM-free and LLM-based methods by leveraging LLM distillation to improve performance while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency.

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: Proposes MMT-FD method for few-shot unsupervised fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, achieving 99% accuracy with only 1% labeled data through time-frequency encoding and meta-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of limited labeled fault samples and lack of model generalizability across different rotating mechanical equipment types in practical industrial applications.

Method: Integrates time-frequency domain encoder with meta-learning generalization model. Uses random augmentations in time-frequency domain for representation learning, followed by meta-learning classification and fine-tuning with limited labeled data through contrastive learning iterations.

Result: Achieves 99% fault diagnosis accuracy using only 1% of labeled sample data on bearing fault dataset and rotor test bench data, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MMT-FD framework effectively addresses data scarcity and generalization challenges in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, providing high efficiency and accuracy with minimal labeled data requirements.

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: EMPG addresses LLM agent learning inefficiency by decoupling policy gradient magnitude from entropy, using uncertainty-aware reward calibration and future clarity bonuses to improve long-horizon task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, where traditional methods fail to properly assign credit to intermediate steps due to entropy-coupled policy gradients causing inefficient updates.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG) that recalibrates learning signals based on step-wise uncertainty and final outcomes, amplifies confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and adds future clarity bonus for predictable paths.

Result: EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines across three challenging agent tasks: WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search.

Conclusion: The EMPG framework effectively addresses the fundamental learning dynamics problem in LLMs by modulating policy gradients with entropy awareness, leading to more stable exploration and improved task performance.

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

TL;DR: MoSE framework enhances GNN structural expressiveness by using anonymous walks to extract subgraphs and dynamically routing them to specialized experts, outperforming baselines across graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs rely on local message passing which limits their ability to capture complex subgraph patterns, and existing random walk kernel methods are restricted to graph-level tasks with fixed configurations.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework that extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics.

Result: MoSE demonstrates superior performance compared to competitive baselines and provides theoretical proof of being more powerful than Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Test, with visualizations showing interpretable structural patterns.

Conclusion: MoSE offers a flexible and expressive approach for subgraph-based representation learning that works across diverse graph tasks while providing improved interpretability of learned structural patterns.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel robust computational approach for HGR correlation coefficient using configurable polynomial kernels, offering improved reliability for real-world applications like constrained machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HGR estimation methods suffer from bias-variance trade-offs due to inherent uncomputability, compromising robustness in real-world scenarios like algorithmic fairness and causal discovery.

Method: Proposes a computational approach based on user-configurable polynomial kernels that provides greater robustness and faster computation compared to previous differentiable estimation methods.

Result: The method offers significant advantages in robustness and determinism, producing insightful subgradients that can effectively serve as loss regularizers in constrained machine learning frameworks.

Conclusion: This approach provides a more reliable and robust option for HGR computation, making it suitable for real-world applications where previous methods had technical limitations.

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

*Mohammed Tiouti,Mohamed Bal-Ghaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaLLMiX is a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework that combines meta-learning, explainable AI, and LLM reasoning to recommend optimal hyperparameters without additional trials, achieving competitive performance with drastically reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based AutoML approaches rely on trial and error with expensive APIs, providing limited interpretability and generalizability. There's a need for more efficient and explainable hyperparameter optimization methods.

Method: Leverages historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, uses meta-learning and efficient LLM reasoning for zero-shot hyperparameter recommendations, and employs LLM-as-judge evaluation for output control.

Result: Achieves competitive/superior performance to traditional HPO methods, reduces response time by 99.6-99.9%, achieves optimal results on 5 of 8 medical imaging tasks, and provides 2.4-15.7x faster training times while maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best baselines.

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX demonstrates that zero-shot hyperparameter optimization is feasible and efficient, offering significant computational savings while maintaining performance, making it a practical alternative to traditional trial-based approaches.

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of
best-performing baselines.

*Harry Mayne,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Yushi Yang,Andrew M. Bean,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate valid counterfactual explanations but struggle with minimality - they either make excessive edits or tiny ineffective changes, creating a validity-minimality trade-off that limits their usefulness as explainability tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective human-AI collaboration, language models need to explain their decisions in natural language, particularly through self-generated counterfactual explanations that show what input changes would alter predictions.

Method: The study evaluates whether LLMs can produce valid (achieve intended outcome) and minimal (modify input as little as possible) counterfactual explanations across multiple LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings.

Result: LLMs typically produce valid counterfactuals but far from minimal ones, offering little insight. When asked for minimal counterfactuals, they make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions, showing a consistent validity-minimality trade-off.

Conclusion: Self-generated counterfactual explanations are ineffective explainability tools that can provide misleading insights, and proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations.

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

### [62] [Kriging prior Regression: A Case for Kriging-Based Spatial Features with TabPFN in Soil Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09408)
*Jonas Schmidinger,Viacheslav Barkov,Sebastian Vogel,Martin Atzmueller,Gerard B M Heuvelink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid framework called KpR combines machine learning with spatial context using kriging-derived features, significantly improving soil property prediction accuracy by 30% compared to non-spatial ML methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine learning (which captures feature relationships) and geostatistics (which leverages spatial structure) for more accurate digital soil mapping in precision agriculture.

Method: Proposed Kriging Prior Regression (KpR) that enriches ML models with spatial context through 'spatial lag' features derived from ordinary kriging, using TabPFN model on six field-scale datasets with soil properties and remote/proximal sensing features.

Result: KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable uncertainty estimates and significantly more accurate predictions, improving average R2 by ~30% compared to non-spatial ML algorithms and outperforming other spatial techniques like regression/residual kriging.

Conclusion: KpR with TabPFN is a robust and versatile modeling framework for digital soil mapping, particularly effective for small sample sizes common in precision agriculture and compensating for weak feature-property relationships when sensing data is limited.

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

*Daniel Agyapong,Briana H. Beatty,Peter G. Kennedy,Toby D. Hocking*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes fuser algorithm for microbiome network inference that handles spatial/temporal dynamics, outperforms baselines in cross-environment scenarios while maintaining performance in homogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing co-occurrence network algorithms analyze single environmental niches, capturing static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes across varying ecological conditions.

Method: Developed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework and fuser algorithm that retains subsample-specific signals while sharing information across environments, generating distinct environment-specific predictive networks.

Result: fuser achieves comparable performance to glmnet in homogeneous environments and significantly reduces test error in cross-environment scenarios compared to baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed fuser algorithm effectively addresses limitations of conventional microbiome network inference methods by capturing both environment-specific and shared microbial associations across spatial and temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSGD is a novel score-based graph diffusion model for controllable molecular generation that uses concrete scores for discrete graphs, achieving 15.3% better controllability than prior methods while maintaining high validity and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models have limited effectiveness in multi-conditional molecular generation due to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise fidelity.

Method: Extends score matching to discrete graphs via concrete scores, introduces Composable Guidance (CoG) for fine-grained control over condition subsets, and Probability Calibration (PC) to mitigate train-test mismatches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four molecular datasets with 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity.

Conclusion: Score-based modeling provides practical advantages for discrete graph generation and enables flexible, multi-property molecular design for drug and material discovery.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

*Maysam Behmanesh,Erkan Turan,Maks Ovsjanikov*

TL;DR: Novel graph alignment framework that enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces using dual-pass encoder and geometry-aware functional maps


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised graph alignment methods suffer from node distinctiveness degradation due to GNN oversmoothing and latent space misalignment caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability

Method: Dual-pass encoder combining low-pass and high-pass spectral filters for structure-aware discriminative embeddings, plus geometry-aware functional map module for bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings

Result: Consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines on graph benchmarks, shows superior robustness to structural inconsistencies, and effectively generalizes to vision-language alignment tasks

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key limitations in graph alignment by simultaneously improving node distinctiveness and ensuring geometric consistency, demonstrating broad applicability across domains

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

*Golnoosh Abdollahinejad,Saleh Baghersalimi,Denisa-Andreea Constantinescu,Sergey Shevchik,David Atienza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AquaCast is a multi-input deep learning model for urban water forecasting that captures dependencies between endogenous variables (water measurements) and exogenous factors (weather data) without needing to forecast exogenous variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional water forecasting models struggle to effectively incorporate both internal water measurements and external weather factors while capturing their complex interrelationships and temporal dependencies.

Method: Developed AquaCast with embedding layer for exogenous inputs, focusing forecast only on endogenous variables. Uses multi-input, multi-output architecture to capture inter-variable and temporal dependencies. Tested on real LausanneCity dataset and three synthetic datasets with varying complexity.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance using only endogenous variables, with further improvement when including exogenous variables. Consistently outperformed baselines across both real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: AquaCast provides an effective approach for urban water forecasting by intelligently incorporating exogenous factors without forecasting them, enabling better attention to short-term influences and maintaining accuracy across diverse datasets.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel method to explain concept drift by tracking temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations (GCEs) to reveal structural changes in model decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in dynamic environments suffer from concept drift that degrades performance, but explaining how and why the model's decision-making logic changes remains a significant challenge.

Method: Three-layer framework combining data layer (distributional shifts), model layer (prediction disagreement), and explanation layer (temporal evolution of GCE cluster centroids and counterfactual action vectors).

Result: The approach provides interpretable proxies that reveal structural changes in model decision boundaries and allows comprehensive diagnosis of drift by distinguishing between different root causes.

Conclusion: The methodology enables holistic view of concept drift, making it possible to distinguish between different types of drift such as spatial data shift versus concept re-labeling through interpretable explanation tracking.

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant introduces learnable butterfly transforms for 2-bit quantization of LLMs, replacing fixed Hadamard rotations with continuous Givens rotation angles to adapt to layer-specific outlier patterns, achieving better performance than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models require massive memory, and extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to activation outliers. Fixed rotation methods like QuIP and QuaRot cannot adapt to different transformer layers' distinct outlier patterns.

Method: Proposes ButterflyQuant with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles instead of fixed Hadamard matrices. Uses orthogonal constraint for theoretical guarantees and introduces uniformity regularization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges quickly on a single GPU.

Result: On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot, demonstrating significant improvement in quantization performance.

Conclusion: Layer-adaptive butterfly transforms outperform fixed rotation methods for extreme quantization, providing better outlier suppression while maintaining computational efficiency and enabling gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy leakage concerns in stochastic optimization while overcoming limitations of DPSGD's static noise mechanism and handling the challenge of efficiently learning models with exponentially increasing parameters.

Method: Combines dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with automatic gradient clipping and random projection with SGD, allowing dynamic adjustment of privacy-utility tradeoff.

Result: Exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective functions, matches best available rate, and extensive experiments show enhanced accuracy while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD successfully addresses privacy concerns while improving model performance and learning efficiency through dynamic privacy mechanisms and random projection techniques.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Method: Created PIPES - a comprehensive collection of experiments with 9,408 pipelines representing all combinations of selected techniques across 300 datasets, including detailed performance metrics and error information.

Result: Built a repository with complete pipeline diversity, storing training/testing times, predictions, performances, and error messages for comprehensive meta-learning analysis.

Conclusion: PIPES provides a more diverse and representative experimental collection than OpenML, supporting better meta-learning research with potential for future expansion.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary
material, and all experiments can be found at

*Yoga Disha Sendhil Kumar,Manas V Shetty,Sudip Vhaduri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Few-shot learning using Prototypical Networks with cough sound spectrograms achieves competitive accuracy (74.87% multi-class, 70%+ binary) for COVID-19/Flu/healthy classification with minimal training data, showing no significant performance difference between binary and multi-class approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited labeled data in medical diagnostics by investigating whether few-shot learning can achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning methods with significantly fewer training samples for respiratory sound classification.

Method: Leveraged Prototypical Networks with spectrogram representations of cough sounds, evaluating both multi-class and binary classification models with limited support examples (15 per class).

Result: Achieved 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification and over 70% accuracy in binary classification across all class pairs. Flu was most distinguishable, Healthy most challenging. Statistical tests showed no significant performance difference between binary and multi-class models.

Conclusion: Few-shot learning is feasible for medical diagnostics when large labeled datasets are unavailable, with multi-class classification performing comparably to binary approaches for respiratory sound classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

### [75] [ProDiGy: Proximity- and Dissimilarity-Based Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09534)
*Sena Ergisi,Luis Maßny,Rawad Bitar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProDiGy is a new Byzantine-robust federated learning algorithm that uses a dual scoring system based on gradient proximity and dissimilarity to detect adversarial attacks, particularly effective under non-IID data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially when client data is heterogeneous (non-IID distribution), creating a need for robust defense mechanisms that can handle these challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes a joint dual scoring system that evaluates client gradients based on both proximity (similarity to honest clients) and dissimilarity (detecting suspicious uniformity that indicates coordinated attacks).

Result: Extensive numerical experiments show ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses, maintaining strong defense capabilities and model accuracy even when other mechanisms fail under non-IID data distributions.

Conclusion: The dual perspective approach effectively promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting suspicious uniformity as attack indicators, demonstrating the effectiveness of this methodology for Byzantine-robust FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning emulator for stochastic/chaotic spatio-temporal systems that generalizes across PDE parameter values using pre-training and fine-tuning with local attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create computationally efficient emulators for complex PDE systems that can generalize across parameter spaces and handle varying domain sizes/resolutions.

Method: Pre-train on single parameter domain, then fine-tune on diverse smaller dataset. Uses local attention mechanisms to handle varying domain sizes and resolutions. Tested on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and beta-plane turbulence.

Result: Model captures phenomena at interpolated parameter values, provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional integration, and probabilistic variant enables uncertainty quantification for rare events.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient parameter space exploration and statistical study of rare events while maintaining computational efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization gap and lack of discretization invariance in existing operator learning algorithms for solving PDEs with multiple distinct inputs, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Combines Reduced Basis Method with neural networks using a greedy algorithm to build network structure offline, employs knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions for compact architecture, and embeds physics for minimal online computational cost.

Result: Significantly outperforms PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO, and CNO in eliminating/shrinking generalization gap for both in- and out-of-distribution tests, and is the only operator learning algorithm achieving strict discretization invariance.

Conclusion: ReBaNO provides a mathematically rigorous, computationally efficient approach for operator learning that demonstrates superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis
Neural Operator (ReBaNO), to solve a group of PDEs with multiple distinct
inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

TL;DR: A novel Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework that encodes molecules using both curated and mined functional groups, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing chemical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for molecular property prediction lack interpretability, hindering adoption by chemists who need to understand structure-property relationships.

Method: Develops FGR framework using two types of functional groups: curated from chemical knowledge (FG) and mined from molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). Integrates pre-training on unlabeled molecules and includes 2D structure-based descriptors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 33 benchmark datasets across physical chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and pharmacokinetics.

Conclusion: The FGR framework represents a significant advancement toward high-performing, chemically interpretable deep learning models that align with established chemical principles and enable direct linking of properties to specific functional groups.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.
