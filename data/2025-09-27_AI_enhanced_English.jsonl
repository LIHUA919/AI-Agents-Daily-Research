The robust recourse literature addresses\nthis issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is\nresilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first\nprovably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized\nlinear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm.\nHowever, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high\nprice. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,\nwe demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of\nrecourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also\nexhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its\nvalidity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides\nmore sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to\npost-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a new algorithm for computing optimal robust recourse recommendations that are resilient to model changes measured by L^p norms (p\u22651, p\u2260\u221e), addressing limitations of prior L^\u221e-based approaches that resulted in high-cost recourses.", "motivation": "Current robust recourse methods lack theoretical optimality guarantees and L^\u221e norm-based approaches lead to high-cost recourses. The authors aim to develop provably optimal algorithms using more constrained L^p norms to achieve lower-cost, more practical recourse solutions.", "method": "The authors develop a new algorithm that provably computes optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models under L^p norm constraints (p\u22651, p\u2260\u221e). The approach handles both linear and non-linear models and provides theoretical guarantees on optimality.", "result": "Empirical results show the algorithm achieves significantly lower recourse costs (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work, better trade-offs between implementation cost and validity, more sparse recourses, and resilience to post-processing approaches.", "conclusion": "The proposed L^p norm-based robust recourse algorithm provides provably optimal solutions with substantially lower costs and better practical properties than existing L^\u221e approaches, making robust recourse more feasible for real-world applications."}}
