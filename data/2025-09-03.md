### [1] [A Comparative Study of Controllability, Explainability, and Performance in Dysfluency Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00058)
*Eric Zhang,Li Wei,Sarah Chen,Michael Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of four dysfluency detection approaches (YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, SSDM) evaluating performance, controllability, and explainability for clinical adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of dysfluency detection models requires more than just accuracy - models must be controllable and explainable, which current benchmarking doesn't adequately address.

Method: Systematic comparative analysis of four representative approaches across multiple datasets with expert clinician assessment, evaluating performance, controllability, and explainability dimensions.

Result: YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet offer efficiency but limited transparency; UDM achieves best balance of accuracy and clinical interpretability; SSDM could not be fully reproduced.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between different approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency modeling, providing implementation insights and deployment considerations.

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

### [2] [Beyond Memorization: Reasoning-Driven Synthesis as a Mitigation Strategy Against Benchmark Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00072)
*Terry Jingchen Zhang,Gopal Dev,Ning Wang,Nicole Ni,Wenyuan Jiang,Yinya Huang,Bernhard Schölkopf,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows LLMs don't significantly decay in performance after knowledge cutoff dates when tested on complex multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from arXiv papers, suggesting current benchmarks may not effectively detect contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about data contamination in LLM evaluation benchmarks and determine if performance decay after knowledge cutoff dates indicates genuine reasoning vs memorization.

Method: Used infinitely scalable framework to synthesize research-level QA from arXiv papers, leveraging temporal structure. Evaluated 4 frontier models on 1,643 multi-step reasoning questions from 20,277 papers across 26 months, covering periods before and after cutoff dates.

Result: Consistent lack of significant performance decay near knowledge cutoff dates across models of various sizes, developers, and release dates. Multi-step reasoning complexity appears to mitigate benchmark contamination.

Conclusion: Advocates for paradigm shift toward reasoning-driven synthesis for benchmarks rather than periodic collection of new questions, and open-sources code/dataset for reproducibility.

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

### [3] [Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074)
*Cédric Colas,Tracey Mills,Ben Prystawski,Michael Henry Tessler,Noah Goodman,Jacob Andreas,Joshua Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework for social learning that integrates linguistic guidance with direct experience through joint probabilistic inference, using pretrained language models to enable both generating and interpreting advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience for safe and rapid learning, and to develop AI systems that can similarly integrate these knowledge sources.

Method: Joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models using sensorimotor and linguistic data. A pretrained language model is converted into a probabilistic model of human advice-sharing, enabling both advice generation and interpretation during Bayesian inference.

Result: Linguistic guidance shapes exploration and accelerates learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models across 10 video games. Successful knowledge transfer between humans and models through iterated learning experiments.

Conclusion: Structured, language-compatible representations enable effective human-machine collaborative learning, demonstrating how linguistic guidance can be integrated with direct experience for accelerated and safer learning in both biological and artificial systems.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

### [4] [Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115)
*Manish Shukla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm for agentic AI systems that improves anomaly detection performance compared to static thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of agentic AI systems focus primarily on technical metrics while neglecting human-centered and economic considerations. The authors aim to address this gap by providing an algorithmic framework for comprehensive multi-dimensional monitoring.

Method: The authors formalize an AMDM algorithm that normalizes heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds, and performs joint anomaly detection via Mahalanobis distance. They conduct simulations and real-world experiments to validate their approach.

Result: AMDM reduces anomaly-detection latency from 12.3s to 5.6s on simulated goal drift and cuts false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared to static thresholds. The paper includes comparison tables, ROC/PR curves, and reanalyzed case studies.

Conclusion: The AMDM framework provides an effective solution for monitoring agentic AI systems across multiple dimensions, addressing the current overemphasis on technical metrics and improving detection performance while considering human-centered and economic factors.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

### [5] [Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00079)
*Andrew G. A. Correa,Ana C. H de Matos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Entropy-guided refinement is a lightweight test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger targeted refinement passes, achieving 95% of reasoning model quality at 1/3 the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models provide better performance but at 3-5x higher cost and latency, creating a need for cost-effective alternatives that maintain quality.

Method: Extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-k alternatives, use OR-logic trigger (perplexity, max token entropy, low-confidence count), and pass uncertainty report back for corrective edits.

Result: Achieves 95% of reference reasoning model quality at ~1/3 cost, with selective refinement on ~31% of responses and 16 percentage point accuracy improvement over single-pass inference.

Conclusion: Provides effective middle ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it practical for production deployments balancing quality and cost.

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

### [6] [Virtual Group Knowledge and Group Belief in Topological Evidence Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00184)
*Alexandru Baltag,Malvin Gattinger,Djanira Gomes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a formal logic framework for group knowledge and belief in multi-agent systems using topological evidence models, providing complete axiomatizations and decidability results for both static and dynamic evidence-sharing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge models from individual agents to groups, capturing how collective knowledge and beliefs emerge from shared evidence in multi-agent systems.

Method: Extends topological semantics of evidence-based belief to groups, develops logical systems for group evidence (hard and soft), group knowledge, and group belief, then adds dynamic evidence-sharing operators and analyzes their expressiveness.

Result: Complete axiomatization and decidability proofs for the logic of group evidence and its fragment for group knowledge/belief; shows that dynamic evidence-sharing extensions are co-expressive with their static bases.

Conclusion: The framework successfully formalizes group knowledge and belief in evidence-based settings, with complete logical systems that remain decidable even when extended with dynamic evidence-sharing capabilities.

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

### [7] [Wrong Face, Wrong Move: The Social Dynamics of Emotion Misperception in Agent-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00080)
*David Freire-Obregón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows that emotion recognition accuracy in AI agents significantly impacts social behavior - low accuracy leads to emotional disintegration and social disorder, while high accuracy enables resilient emotional clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how perceptual accuracy in emotion detection affects emergent emotional and spatial behavior in social agents, and examine the impact of systematic misperception on social processes.

Method: Agents with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy (poor/medium/high) are placed on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving neighbors' emotions and responding by moving toward positive and away from negative emotions. Experiments include homogeneous/heterogeneous populations and repeated emotional shocks.

Result: Low-accuracy classifiers result in diminished trust, emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. High-accuracy agents develop resilient emotional clusters and resistance to disruptions. Even in neutral scenarios, misperception causes segregation and cohesion breakdown.

Conclusion: Biases or imprecision in emotion recognition can significantly warp social processes and disrupt emotional integration, highlighting the importance of accurate emotion perception for healthy social organization.

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

### [8] [HiVA: Self-organized Hierarchical Variable Agent via Goal-driven Semantic-Topological Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00189)
*Jinzhou Tang,Jusheng Zhang,Qinhan Lv,Sidi Liu,Jing Yang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiVA is a novel framework that models agent workflows as self-organized graphs using Semantic-Topological Evolution algorithm to optimize both semantic meaning and topological structure through textual gradients, achieving 5-10% accuracy improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous agent paradigms face a trade-off: fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration for environmental changes, while flexible reactive loops cannot distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. There's a need for a framework that can autonomously adapt and optimize workflows in unknown environments.

Method: HiVA uses Semantic-Topological Evolution (STEV) algorithm to model agent workflows as self-organized graphs. It optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The iterative process includes Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing, diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology.

Result: Experiments across dialogue, coding, long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks show 5-10% improvements in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: HiVA establishes effectiveness in autonomous task execution by enabling self-organized workflow optimization that adapts to unknown environments while distilling reasoning progress into transferable structures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

### [9] [Ensemble Debates with Local Large Language Models for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00091)
*Ephraiem Sarabamoun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Open-source ensemble debates improve LLM alignment with human values, outperforming single models on reasoning depth and argument quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes decisions, ensuring alignment with human values is crucial. Proprietary APIs limit reproducibility and broad participation in alignment research.

Method: Conducted 150 debates across 15 scenarios using five ensemble configurations of local open-source models, comparing against single-model baselines using a 7-point evaluation rubric.

Result: Ensembles significantly outperformed single models (3.48 vs 3.13 overall), with largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Strongest improvements in truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80).

Conclusion: Local open-source ensemble debates provide an accessible and reproducible method for improving alignment-oriented reasoning, offering a foundation for broader participation in alignment evaluation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing
an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment
evaluation.

*Bo Fu,Zhe Chen,Rahul Chandan,Alex Barbosa,Michael Caldara,Joey Durham,Federico Pecora*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP) for warehouse management and proposes five search-based algorithms to solve it efficiently in large grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenging problem of rearranging storage blocks in dense warehouse grids to achieve target configurations, which is a critical component of large warehouse management systems.

Method: Formally defined BRaP as a graph search problem and proposed five search-based solution algorithms using joint configuration space search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics.

Result: The methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply buried blocks in large grids up to 80x80 size, despite the exponential relationship between search space size and block number.

Conclusion: The proposed search-based approaches effectively solve the Block Rearrangement Problem and show scalability for practical warehouse management applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

### [11] [MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100)
*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE replaces traditional vector database retrieval with cluster-and-route approach for small domain-specific collections, achieving similar answer quality with faster retrieval times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems with large vector databases and cross-encoders are excessive for small, domain-specific document collections, requiring a more lightweight solution.

Method: Documents are embedded, grouped into semantic clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, routing occurs to top centroid(s) and context is retrieved only within those clusters.

Result: On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora (100-500 chunks), MODE matches or exceeds dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: MODE provides a practical solution for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus are important, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure needs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

### [12] [Question-to-Knowledge: Multi-Agent Generation of Inspectable Facts for Product Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01182)
*Wonduk Seo,Taesub Shin,Hyunjin An,Dokyun Kim,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Q2K is a multi-agent LLM framework that uses targeted questioning and web searches to accurately map similar product listings to the same SKU, outperforming traditional methods in ecommerce product matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based heuristics and keyword similarity methods often fail to distinguish subtle product differences like brand variations, specifications, or bundle configurations, leading to inaccurate SKU mapping in ecommerce.

Method: Q2K employs three agents: Reasoning Agent generates disambiguation questions, Knowledge Agent performs focused web searches to answer them, and Deduplication Agent reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy. Includes human-in-the-loop for uncertain cases.

Result: Experiments on real-world consumer goods datasets show Q2K surpasses strong baselines with higher accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios like bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation.

Conclusion: Q2K provides a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution for product integration by balancing accuracy with computational efficiency through reasoning reuse instead of repeated searches.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

### [13] [Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245)
*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Wei Zhang,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchedCP is a framework that uses autonomous LLM agents to optimize Linux schedulers by separating semantic reasoning from execution, achieving up to 1.79x performance improvement and 13x cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operating system schedulers suffer from a semantic gap where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: SchedCP implements a decoupled control plane as a Model Context Protocol server with three services: Workload Analysis Engine, Scheduler Policy Repository, and Execution Verifier that validates AI-generated code before deployment.

Result: Achieves up to 1.79x performance improvement and 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches while maintaining high success rate.

Conclusion: SchedCP bridges the semantic gap, democratizes expert-level system optimization, and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced
in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp

### [14] [Know When to Explore: Difficulty-Aware Certainty as a Guide for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00125)
*Ang Li,Zhihang Yuan,Yang Zhang,Shouda Liu,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DACE is a novel RL algorithm that uses LLM self-certainty to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation trade-off based on task difficulty, improving reasoning performance on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLVF relies on sparse outcome-based rewards that fail to provide granular guidance on the reasoning process, hindering efficient learning and preventing models from distinguishing between high-quality and inefficient solutions.

Method: DACE assesses task difficulty online based on policy success rate and uses this to modulate intrinsic rewards - penalizing high certainty for difficult tasks to encourage exploration, and rewarding high certainty for easier tasks to encourage learning efficiency.

Result: Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and more robust performance when scaling test-time compute.

Conclusion: DACE's adaptive approach effectively fosters exploration without sacrificing precision, demonstrating that leveraging LLM self-certainty correlation with task difficulty can significantly improve reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

### [15] [LLM-empowered Agents Simulation Framework for Scenario Generation in Service Ecosystem Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01441)
*Deyu Zhou,Yuqi Hou,Xiao Xue,Xudong Lu,Qingzhong Li,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel LLM-powered multi-agent system for generating high-quality social scenarios to improve service ecosystem governance through adaptive experimental scheme optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scenario analysis methods for service ecosystem governance rely on predefined rules and face limitations in handling complex social environments, limited information, and numerous influencing factors, leading to inefficient and low-quality scenario generation.

Method: Proposes a scenario generator with three coordinated LLM agents: Environment Agent (EA) generates social environments including extremes, Social Agent (SA) generates social collaboration structures, and Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role relationships and plans solutions while adjusting schemes in real-time based on agent states.

Result: Experiments on ProgrammableWeb dataset show the method generates more accurate scenarios more efficiently compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent LLM framework provides an innovative and effective approach for constructing experimental systems for service ecosystem governance, overcoming limitations of traditional rule-based scenario generation methods.

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARP tool developed for optimizing health facility planning in Ethiopia to maximize population coverage under budget constraints while meeting regional proportionality targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethiopia needs to prioritize limited healthcare budget allocation across regions to expand essential healthcare services as part of UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage.

Method: Developed Health Access Resource Planner (HARP) with two algorithms: learning-augmented approach for single-step improvement over expert recommendations, and greedy algorithm for multi-step planning with worst-case approximation guarantees.

Result: Demonstrated empirical efficacy through collaboration with Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health across three regions in various planning scenarios.

Conclusion: HARP provides a principled optimization framework for sequential facility planning that can effectively guide healthcare resource allocation decisions under budget uncertainty while ensuring regional proportionality.

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

### [17] [How Real Is AI Tutoring? Comparing Simulated and Human Dialogues in One-on-One Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01914)
*Ruijia Li,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Jiatong Wang,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-simulated tutoring dialogues lack the pedagogical richness of human dialogues, showing structural simplification and behavioral convergence compared to human's cognitively guided, diverse teaching patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues, as current LLMs face challenges in generating pedagogically rich interactions.

Method: Quantitative comparison using Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to analyze dialogue patterns.

Result: Human dialogues superior in utterance length, questioning behaviors, and feedback. ENA revealed human dialogues are cognitively guided with "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop, while AI shows "explanation-simplistic response" information transfer pattern.

Conclusion: Current AI-generated tutoring has key limitations in pedagogical effectiveness, providing empirical guidance for designing better educational dialogue systems.

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

TL;DR: DSP is an online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration for LLM agents with 30% cost reduction and up to 60% reduction in unnecessary costs, while allowing flexible tradeoffs between latency and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents face prohibitive latency and inference costs in deployment. Existing acceleration methods either fail to preserve performance, require extensive offline training, or incur excessive operational costs with minimal user control over performance tradeoffs.

Method: Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP) - an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation.

Result: Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks show DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%.

Conclusion: DSP provides a practical solution for LLM agent acceleration with flexible performance-cost tradeoffs, substantial cost savings, and no pre-deployment requirements.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research agents are hard-coded with fixed research strategies and tools, limiting flexibility and requiring specialized development for each approach.

Method: UDR wraps around any language model and provides a system for users to create, edit, and refine custom research strategies through a user interface, with example strategies including minimal, expansive, and intensive approaches.

agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research

### [20] [Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251)
*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS is a method that uses system instructions as external pseudo-parameters updated via reflection and user feedback, enabling dynamic knowledge integration without retrieval or fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements in enterprise applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like RAG and fine-tuning have limitations - RAG increases latency and engineering overhead, while fine-tuning is costly and risks catastrophic forgetting. There's a need for a more efficient way to integrate new knowledge into LLMs.

Method: Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS) uses curated system instructions as external pseudo-parameters updated after each session. A Reflection Engine analyzes conversations, diagnoses reasoning, and proposes typed deltas over instructions, user preferences, and tools. These are version-controlled, evaluated with ratings, and distilled into model parameters when an edit budget threshold is crossed.

Result: In enterprise support, ILWS increased throughput 2.4-5.0x and reduced audited hallucinations by about 80% versus frozen baseline. In Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept, it achieved 4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket with autonomous instruction updates.

Conclusion: ILWS provides an effective approach for dynamic knowledge integration in LLMs, operating at the instruction layer until controlled distillation. It generalizes to dynamic domains requiring adaptive reasoning, tool creation, and low-latency deployment while preserving governance and eliminating per-call retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SHERPA is a model-driven framework that improves LLM performance on complex tasks by incorporating domain-specific best practices into hierarchical state machines, enabling fine-grained control over LLM behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack structured reasoning ability for complex tasks requiring domain-specific best practices that are unavailable in training data. Existing multi-step prompting methods lack general control mechanisms.

Method: Proposes SHERPA framework that structures LLM execution processes using hierarchical state machines, allowing control via rules or ML-based decisions including LLMs themselves.

Result: SHERPA significantly improves LLM output quality across code generation, class name generation, and question answering tasks, particularly benefiting complex tasks with established human best practices but limited training data.

Conclusion: Integrating well-designed state machines provides effective control over LLM behavior and enhances performance on complex domain-specific tasks where traditional training data is insufficient.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

*Brian Wang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIGMUS system uses LLMs to automatically integrate multimodal urban sensor data into knowledge graphs for incident analysis without human rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban spaces have abundant multimodal sensor data but current approaches rely on human-driven reasoning to identify relationships between data sources and incidents, making integration difficult and fragmented.

Method: Developed SIGMUS system that uses Large Language Models to generate world knowledge for identifying relationships between urban incidents and multimodal data, organizing evidence into knowledge graphs without human-encoded rules.

Result: The system successfully produced reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (news articles, CCTV images, air quality, weather, traffic) and relevant incidents occurring at same time and location.

Conclusion: SIGMUS demonstrates that LLMs can effectively automate the integration of multimodal urban data into structured knowledge graphs for incident analysis, overcoming reliance on human-driven reasoning.

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

TL;DR: NEWSAGENT benchmark evaluates autonomous agents' ability to perform journalistic tasks including content search, information selection, and article generation from multimodal web data, showing current agents struggle with planning and narrative integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well autonomous digital agents can improve multimodal web data productivity in journalism, which requires complex iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from raw multimodal content.

Method: Introduces NEWSAGENT benchmark with 6k human-verified examples from real news, converted to text for broad compatibility. Evaluates open- and closed-source LLMs with agentic frameworks on tasks including narrative perspective identification, keyword querying, historical background retrieval, and complete article generation.

Result: Agents demonstrate capability in retrieving relevant facts but struggle significantly with planning and narrative integration tasks, highlighting current limitations in autonomous journalistic content creation.

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT provides a realistic testbed for evaluating agent capabilities in multimodal web data manipulation and reveals critical gaps in autonomous systems' ability to handle complex real-world productivity tasks like news writing.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines how locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and carrageenan affect ice cream melting behavior, finding they create stable foam structures and improve resilience when re-frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how common stabilizers influence ice cream melting resistance and identify cost-effective recipe formulations for improved product quality and consumer acceptance.

Method: Prepared ice cream samples with different additives, conducted melting tests under controlled conditions using timelapse recordings, and analyzed results with Python and OpenCV.

Result: All samples retained foam-like structure after melting, stabilizers contributed to stable air-cell matrix formation, and re-frozen samples showed increased sturdiness and improved resilience.

Conclusion: Study provides insights into functional roles of food additives in ice cream, demonstrating potential for developing cost-effective recipes that balance durability with economic efficiency for practical applications.

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond static prompt engineering and isolated agent simulations by creating a dynamic, scalable collective intelligence system that evolves through human-LLM interaction and coordination.

Method: Four-stage approach: (1) Subclass Brain formation through personalized user-LLM interactions, (2) GA-assisted forward-backward evolution for prompt refinement, (3) Swarm Intelligence coordination of multiple Subclass Brains, (4) Integration into Superclass Brain meta-intelligence.

Result: Initial implementations demonstrated in UAV scheduling and keyword filtering tasks, with proposed registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation.

Conclusion: Provides conceptual foundation and architectural roadmap for scalable, explainable, and ethically aligned collective AI systems through emergent meta-intelligence.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Result: Successfully generated functional residential layouts with full Revit-native parametric attributes, enabling direct integration into professional BIM workflows.

Conclusion: The AI-powered workflow effectively automates schematic floor plan generation from text, providing transparent and replicable methodology for architectural design assistance.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI-powered workflow that uses Large

case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans naturally navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, while AI systems struggle with automatically structuring and reasoning about implicit social contexts.

Method: Developed a POMDP-driven structured social world representation (S3AP) that represents social interactions as structured tuples (state, observation, agent actions, mental states) that can be automatically induced from free-form narratives.

Result: S3AP helped LLMs achieve +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning and reached new SOTA performance across 5 social reasoning tasks. Social world models induced from S3AP improved agent decision-making by up to +18% on SOTOPIA social interaction benchmark.

Conclusion: S3AP shows promise as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling development of more socially-aware systems that can better navigate social interactions.

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

### [29] [BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622)
*Shiqiao Zhou,Holger Schöner,Huanbo Lyu,Edouard Fouché,Shuo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BALM-TSF is a lightweight multimodal framework that balances time series and textual modalities using learnable prompts and contrastive alignment to achieve state-of-the-art forecasting performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal architectures for time series forecasting often suffer from modality imbalance, over-emphasizing one modality while neglecting the other, leading to information loss and poor performance.

Method: Processes raw time series through a time series encoder while feeding descriptive statistics to an LLM with learnable prompts. Uses scaling strategy and contrastive objective to align textual and time series embeddings in latent space, then integrates both for forecasting.

Result: Extensive experiments show BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting with minimal trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The framework successfully harnesses complementary information from both text and time series modalities through balanced alignment, demonstrating effective multimodal integration for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show

*Jaber Daneshamooz,Eugene Vuong,Laasya Koduru,Sanjay Chandrasekaran,Arpit Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NetGent is an AI-agent framework that automates complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets using natural-language rules compiled into executable NFAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires diverse, realistic traffic data from real-world web applications, but existing browser automation tools are fragile, costly, and lack diversity/repeatability.

Method: Users specify workflows as natural-language rules defining state-dependent actions, which are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and translated into reusable executable code with state synthesis and caching.

Result: NetGent automated 50+ workflows across various domains (video streaming, conferencing, social media, web scraping), producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability.

Conclusion: NetGent combines language-based agent flexibility with compiled execution reliability, providing a scalable foundation for generating diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

### [31] [On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized Knowledge Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00710)
*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Modular multi-agent framework improves legal reasoning by separating knowledge acquisition from application, achieving 76.4% accuracy vs 18.8% baseline on tax calculation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal reasoning requires precise interpretation of statutes and consistent rule application, presenting challenges for AI systems that need transparency and verifiability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules into verifiable intermediate representations; 2) Three-step application: query analysis, symbolic inference, and programmatic answer generation using ontological knowledge.

Result: Substantial improvement from 18.8% baseline to 76.4% accuracy on statutory tax calculation tasks, effectively narrowing performance gap between reasoning and foundational models.

Conclusion: Modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible, enhancing consistency and explainability while establishing foundation for transparent and trustworthy AI legal systems.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

### [32] [OmniDPO: A Preference Optimization Framework to Address Omni-Modal Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00723)
*Junzhe Chen,Tianshu Zhang,Shiyu Huang,Yuwei Niu,Chao Sun,Rongzhou Zhang,Guanyu Zhou,Lijie Wen,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniDPO is a preference-alignment framework that reduces hallucinations in omni-modal LLMs by enhancing audio-video interaction understanding and strengthening attention to visual/auditory information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OLLMs suffer from hallucination issues where text priors dominate, causing neglect of visual/audio information. Existing models also fail to capture intrinsic audio-video correlations, leading to errors when interpreting hidden audio cues in video content.

Method: Proposes OmniDPO with two strategies: (1) text-preference sample pairs to improve audio-video interaction understanding, and (2) multimodal-preference sample pairs to strengthen attention to visual and auditory information.

Result: Experiments on two OLLMs show OmniDPO effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations and significantly enhances reasoning capabilities across modalities.

Conclusion: OmniDPO successfully addresses hallucination challenges in OLLMs by improving multimodal grounding through preference alignment techniques, demonstrating both reduced hallucinations and improved cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

### [33] [Efficient Graph Understanding with LLMs via Structured Context Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00740)
*Govind Waghmare,Sumedh BG,Sonia Gupta,Srikanta Bedathur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for structured context injection that embeds task-specific information in LLM inputs to solve graph problems without fine-tuning, achieving performance comparable to more complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph reasoning tasks remain challenging for LLMs unless mapped to conceptually grounded representations, but fine-tuning or multi-step querying approaches are expensive and inefficient.

Method: Structured context injection - systematically embedding task-specific information directly into the input to guide LLMs in solving graph problems without requiring model fine-tuning.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large models, with structured input context rivaling or surpassing more complex approaches.

Conclusion: Structured context injection is an effective and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs, offering a practical alternative to expensive fine-tuning or multi-step querying methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

*Ziqi Wang,Boqin Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L-MARS is a multi-agent system that reduces hallucinations in legal QA through coordinated reasoning, targeted search across multiple sources, and iterative verification before answer synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering, as single-pass RAG approaches are insufficient for high-stakes legal domains requiring precise retrieval and verification.

Method: Decomposes queries into subproblems, performs targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (web, local RAG, case law), and uses a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity in an iterative reasoning-search-verification loop.

Result: Substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges on the LegalSearchQA benchmark of 200 legal questions.

Conclusion: Multi-agent reasoning with agentic search provides a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes legal domains requiring precise retrieval and deliberation.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

TL;DR: Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) improves AI materials discovery by selecting reasoning traces that follow physical laws and match target values, leading to more accurate and reliable property prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven materials discovery systems use reasoning models trained on traces selected by binary correctness or preference signals, which often fail to ensure physical admissibility and consistency with fundamental physics.

Method: Introduces Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) - a training-time trace selection scheme that prioritizes traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, using lightweight halting to control computational costs. Uses a large student model fine-tuned on traces from a larger teacher model.

Result: The method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling costs compared to various rejection sampling baselines when evaluated under matched token budgets.

Conclusion: Modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable and efficient large reasoning models for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

### [36] [Sharpe Ratio Optimization in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00793)
*Shuai Ma,Guangwu Liu,Li Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic programming approach to optimize Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes by converting it to mean-squared-variance optimization using Dinkelbach's transform and developing iterative algorithms that converge to optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs is challenging due to two fundamental difficulties: dynamic programming doesn't work for fractional objectives and is invalid for risk metrics. Existing methods struggle with these limitations.

Method: Uses Dinkelbach's transform to convert Sharpe ratio to mean-squared-variance objective. Develops iterative algorithms that solve M2V problems and update risk-sensitive parameters, with policy iteration procedures for both average and discounted MDP settings.

Result: The sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. Numerical experiments validate the approach, which is the first to solve Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully addresses both challenges of fractional objectives and risk metrics in MDPs, providing a convergent solution to Sharpe ratio optimization that can potentially be extended to other fractional objectives.

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuro-Symbolic approach for suffix prediction in BPM that integrates deep learning with temporal logic constraints using differentiable LTLf loss functions to ensure logical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for suffix prediction in BPM often fail to satisfy basic logical constraints due to lack of domain knowledge integration during training.

Method: Proposes a differentiable logical loss function using soft approximation of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) and Gumbel-Softmax trick, combined with standard predictive losses in autoregressive sequence predictors.

Result: Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows improved suffix prediction accuracy and better compliance with temporal constraints compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks, improving both accuracy and logical consistency in suffix prediction, with broader applicability to symbolic sequence generation tasks in Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

TL;DR: ChatCLIDS is the first benchmark for evaluating LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change, specifically targeting closed-loop insulin delivery system adoption in type 1 diabetes patients with diverse barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems remains low due to behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers rather than technical failures, highlighting the need for effective persuasive dialogue systems.

Method: The framework uses expert-validated virtual patients with clinically grounded profiles and realistic adoption barriers, simulating multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with evidence-based persuasive strategies, including longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios.

Result: Larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, but all models struggle to overcome resistance, particularly under realistic social pressure, revealing critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change.

Conclusion: ChatCLIDS provides a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare, demonstrating that current LLMs have significant limitations in overcoming real-world adoption barriers despite their adaptive capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

TL;DR: Analysis of neural MCCFR component effectiveness across game scales with adaptive framework for selective deployment, achieving 60% improvement on Kuhn Poker and 23.5% on Leduc Poker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCCFR integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities, requiring different mitigation strategies.

Method: Robust Deep MCCFR framework with target networks, delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and diagnostic monitoring. Systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker.

Result: 60% improvement on Kuhn Poker (0.0628 vs 0.156 exploitability) and 23.5% improvement on Leduc Poker (0.2386 vs 0.3703 exploitability).

Conclusion: Careful component selection is more important than comprehensive mitigation, with scale-dependent effectiveness patterns requiring adaptive deployment strategies.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis of LLM reasoning capabilities, with limited variable control and narrow problem types/formats.

Method: Generates Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from CNF instances using randomized SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT.

Result: Evaluation revealed significant limitations in LLM logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards improved targeted task performance and generalized to more complex instances.

Conclusion: SATQuest serves as a foundational tool for advancing LLM logical reasoning, demonstrating potential for systematic evaluation and enhancement while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Conclusion: This unified approach combining physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go

Motivation: Current patent valuation methods rely on retrospective indicators and manual analysis, which are time-intensive and inefficient for identifying high-value assets for technology transfer.

Method: Multi-stage framework combining Learning to Rank model (evaluating 30+ legal/commercial parameters) with Need Agent (NLP for market needs mining) and Seed Agent (fine-tuned LLMs for patent analysis). Includes dynamic parameter weighting and Human-in-the-Loop validation.

Result: Generates a Core Ontology Framework that matches high-potential patents to documented market demands, providing strategic rationale for divestment decisions.

Conclusion: The framework automates and deepens patent portfolio analysis, ensuring both adaptability and real-world credibility through its hybrid intelligence approach and validation protocols.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

TL;DR: LENS is a neuro-symbolic method that combines symbolic program synthesis with LLMs to automatically explain machine-learned logic programs in natural language, replacing hand-crafted templates with scalable generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of prior Ultra Strong Machine Learning approaches that relied on hand-crafted explanation templates, aiming to create more scalable and effective automated explanation generation for human learning.

Method: Combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models (LLMs) to automate explanation generation, evaluated through systematic assessment using multiple LLM judges and human validation.

Result: LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates, but human learning experiments showed no significant performance improvements as comprehensive LLM responses may overwhelm users for simpler problems.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for building effective USML systems to support human learning, though simpler problems may require different explanation approaches to avoid overwhelming users.

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to

TL;DR: CoreThink introduces a novel General Symbolics reasoning method that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks without fine-tuning or training costs, providing pure performance uplift for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning methods like test-time scaling, SFT, and RLVR are expected to reach diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques.

Method: General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) built around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, using a novel General Symbolics approach that diverges from traditional reasoning paradigms.

Result: Achieves SOTA scores: 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2, and 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite with an agentic coding IDE. Performance improvements without any finetuning or training costs.

Conclusion: CoreThink's Reasoning Layer provides pure performance uplift for reasoning-intensive tasks without negative impact on model accuracy, representing a new approach to address diminishing returns in LLM performance.

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

TL;DR: ReaL-TG is a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs for explainable link forecasting on temporal graphs, using outcome-based rewards to generate self-explored reasoning strategies and high-quality explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional temporal graph neural networks lack explainability and cannot handle unseen graphs without retraining. Existing LLM approaches are limited to static graphs or small synthetic datasets and lack proper evaluation of reasoning quality.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs with outcome-based rewards to encourage self-exploration of reasoning strategies from graph structure and production of explanations that justify predictions. Includes a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with LLM-as-a-Judge system.

Result: ReaL-TG-4B (fine-tuned Qwen3-4B) outperforms much larger frontier LLMs including GPT-5 mini on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations validated by both LLM judge and human evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world temporal graphs, addressing limitations of traditional methods while providing verifiable reasoning quality assessment.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

TL;DR: Review paper on causal multi-agent LLMs that use multiple LLM agents to overcome limitations in causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation through collaborative architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex causal reasoning due to hallucination, spurious correlations, and difficulties with domain-specific/personalized causal relationships, which multi-agent systems can address.

Method: Examines multi-agent LLM systems using various architectural patterns including pipeline processing, debate frameworks, simulation environments, and iterative refinement loops for causal tasks.

Result: Provides comprehensive overview of how multi-agent LLM systems are being applied to causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation across diverse domains like scientific discovery, healthcare, and fact-checking.

Conclusion: Identifies persistent challenges and open research questions while highlighting the promising future of causal multi-agent LLMs as a synergistic approach to advance causal AI capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

TL;DR: LLM agents will become dominant data workloads, requiring new data systems architecture to handle agentic speculation characteristics like scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model agents are expected to be the primary users of data systems in the future, but current systems are not optimized for their high-throughput exploration and solution formulation processes (agentic speculation).

Method: The paper identifies key characteristics of agentic speculation (scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, steerability) and proposes adapting data systems with new query interfaces, query processing techniques, and agentic memory stores.

Result: The analysis reveals that current data systems face challenges with the volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation workloads from LLM agents.

Conclusion: Data systems need fundamental architectural changes to natively support agent-first workloads, presenting new research opportunities across query interfaces, processing techniques, and memory storage.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces open computing implemented through chemical reactions, distinguishing between Token computing (individual molecular behavior) and Type computing (normative behavior), which interact to create self-organizing critical phenomena and quantum logic, enabling spike wave formation and signal transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence by defining and implementing open computing within chemical reactions, creating a system that can adjust fluctuations and demonstrate emergent computational behaviors.

Method: Modeling chemical reactions where computation is the reaction itself and execution environment is molecular aggregation degree. Implementing open computing through Token computing (individual molecular behavior) and Type computing (normative behavior) that interact.

Result: Token computing shows self-organizing critical phenomena, Type computing exhibits quantum logic. Their interplay enables recruitment of fluctuations, quantum coherence across Hilbert spaces, spike wave formation, and signal transmission.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates quantum-like coherence that may explain enzyme control of spike waves and biochemical rhythms, suggesting a novel computational paradigm inspired by natural biological processes.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing game benchmarks lack diversity and don't evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. Adventure games pose additional challenges through complex narrative-driven interactions and the observation-behavior gap.

Method: Introduces FlashAdventure benchmark, CUA-as-a-Judge automated evaluator, and COAST agentic framework that leverages long-term clue memory for better planning and solving sequential tasks.

Result: Current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs. COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap, but still shows marked discrepancy compared to human performance.

Conclusion: While COAST represents progress in addressing the observation-behavior gap, significant performance gap between agents and humans indicates need for continued research to narrow this divide.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

TL;DR: VerlTool is a unified framework that addresses fragmentation and inefficiency in Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) by providing standardized APIs, asynchronous execution, and modular architecture for multi-turn tool interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ARLT approaches suffer from task-specific codebases, fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains, hindering community adoption and algorithmic innovation.

Method: VerlTool introduces a unified framework with: 1) upstream alignment with VeRL, 2) standardized tool APIs for diverse modalities, 3) asynchronous rollout execution for 2x speedup, and 4) modular plugin architecture for rapid tool integration.

Result: The framework achieves competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains (mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, software engineering) with near 2x speedup from asynchronous execution.

Conclusion: VerlTool provides a scalable, unified foundation for tool-augmented RL research, enabling rapid tool integration and reducing development overhead while maintaining performance comparable to specialized systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

Motivation: To create a unified cognitive layer for robots that can handle complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with humans through an end-to-end framework, addressing the need for more capable human-robot interaction systems.

Method: Three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining for embodied reasoning abilities, (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as unified sequences, and (3) reinforcement learning for reasoning-action consistency and task coherence.

Result: Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types and various user-involved tasks like table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

Conclusion: Robix successfully integrates reasoning, planning, and interaction capabilities within a single vision-language architecture, enabling robots to handle complex real-world scenarios with natural human interaction and robust task execution.

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery

Motivation: To provide a formal causal foundation for language model simulation practices, connecting statistical benchmarking to causality theory and offering precise operationalization for concepts like AI role-playing.

Method: Uses causal abstractive simulation (a variation of causal abstraction) to analyze language model simulation capabilities, presenting both failure cases and success cases for simulating fair coin tosses.

Result: Demonstrates that language models can fail to simulate systems properly, but also shows successful simulation cases and provides a formalism to prove simulation capabilities given causal system descriptions.

Conclusion: Causal abstractive simulation offers a rigorous framework for analyzing language model simulation, benefiting practitioners, philosophers, and mathematicians by connecting empirical practices to formal causal theory.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819

formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers

TL;DR: AnchorRAG is a multi-agent framework that enables open-world retrieval-augmented generation without predefined anchor entities, using dynamic candidate identification and parallel multi-hop exploration to overcome entity linking limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on predefined anchor entities for graph traversal, which limits robustness in open-world settings where accurate entity linking is unreliable.

Method: A multi-agent collaboration framework with: 1) predictor agent to dynamically identify candidate anchor entities by aligning query terms with KG nodes, 2) independent retriever agents conducting parallel multi-hop explorations from each candidate, and 3) supervisor agent formulating retrieval strategy and synthesizing knowledge paths.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results on real-world question answering tasks.

Conclusion: AnchorRAG improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or erroneous anchors through its multi-agent collaboration framework, enabling effective open-world RAG without predefined anchor entities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Motivation: Conventional text-to-video models suffer from high computational costs, limiting accessibility and scalability in video production. The rapid advancement of AI and AIGC tasks has created opportunities for more efficient video generation systems.

Method: VGTeam employs a team of communicative agents (LLMs) working collaboratively in a chat tower workflow. Each agent handles specific aspects like scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design, emulating traditional video production stages.

Result: The system achieves remarkable efficiency improvements with average generation cost of $0.103 per video and 98.4% successful generation rate. It maintains high creative fidelity and customization while substantially reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: VGTeam democratizes video production by enabling high-quality content creation without extensive resources. It demonstrates the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions itself as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORMs outperform traditional test-time strategies (ex-BoN and Maj) for Text-to-SQL by using semantic correctness scoring, achieving significant accuracy gains on BIRD and Spider benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries requiring precise intent-schema alignment, and existing test-time strategies rely on surface-level heuristics rather than semantic understanding.

Method: Proposed training Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) to assign utility scores based on semantic correctness, evaluated on BIRD and Spider benchmarks using finetuned open-source LLMs including Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 families.

Result: ORMs achieved execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. Finetuning SQL-aligned models like OmniSQL yielded superior performance.

Conclusion: ORMs provide a more effective test-time strategy for Text-to-SQL than traditional heuristics, with particular benefits on complex queries and when more candidate queries are available.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

TL;DR: GenQPM is a quantitative predictive monitoring method that uses deep generative models and mode classification to provide more informative, mode-specific prediction intervals for stochastic systems with multi-modal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QPM methods produce overly conservative and uninformative prediction intervals when systems exhibit multi-modal dynamics, where different modes can yield vastly different satisfaction values for temporal logic properties.

Method: Leverages score-based diffusion models to approximate probabilistic multi-modal system dynamics without explicit model access, employs a mode classifier to partition trajectories by dynamical mode, and applies conformal inference to produce statistically valid mode-specific prediction intervals.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on agent navigation and autonomous driving benchmarks, showing significantly more informative (less conservative) prediction intervals compared to mode-agnostic baselines.

Conclusion: GenQPM successfully addresses the limitations of mode-agnostic QPM methods by providing mode-specific satisfaction predictions, enabling more accurate runtime monitoring and timely intervention for stochastic systems with complex multi-modal dynamics.

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

### [58] [Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01350)
*Yunqing Liu,Nan Zhang,Zhiming Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel part retrieval framework using Error Notebooks + RAG for improved CAD assembly part retrieval without additional training, achieving up to 23.4% accuracy improvement on GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct LLM/VLM use for CAD part retrieval faces token limit issues and unsatisfactory performance, while fine-tuning requires significant resources and is unavailable for proprietary models like GPT/Gemini.

Method: Error Notebooks construction (collecting erroneous CoTs with corrections) + RAG to retrieve specification-relevant records for prompt engineering, enabling improved retrieval without extra training.

Result: Substantial performance gains with GPT-4o achieving 23.4% absolute accuracy improvement on human preference dataset; CoT reasoning particularly beneficial for complex cases (>10 parts).

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles 3D models with lengthy metadata and improves existing general models' retrieval performance without requiring fine-tuning or additional computational resources.

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

TL;DR: DeepResearch Arena is a benchmark for evaluating deep research agents using academic seminar data, featuring over 10,000 research tasks across 12 disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of research agents is challenging due to difficulty collecting genuine frontier research questions that capture researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity.

Method: Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task Generation (MAHTG) system extracts research-worthy inspirations from seminar transcripts and translates them into high-quality research tasks while filtering noise.

Result: Created DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from 200+ academic seminars across 12 disciplines, presenting substantial challenges for state-of-the-art agents with clear performance gaps.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a faithful evaluation environment grounded in real academic discourse, better reflecting real-world research scenarios while reducing data leakage risks.

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

*Cristina Cornelio,Takuya Ito,Ryan Cory-Wright,Sanjeeb Dash,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI accelerates scientific discovery by generating hypotheses at scale, but requires rigorous verification to ensure scientific value and avoid hindering progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge that while AI (machine learning and LLMs) can generate hypotheses at unprecedented scale and speed, without reliable verification mechanisms, this abundance could actually hinder rather than advance scientific progress.

Method: The paper traces historical scientific discovery development, examines how AI reshapes established practices, and reviews principal approaches including data-driven methods, knowledge-aware neural architectures, symbolic reasoning frameworks, and LLM agents.

Result: The review shows that AI systems can uncover patterns and propose candidate scientific laws, but their effectiveness depends on verification processes.

Conclusion: Rigorous and transparent verification must be the cornerstone of AI-assisted scientific discovery to ensure the scientific value of AI-generated hypotheses and prevent hindering progress.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSR is a lightweight training method that improves LLM reasoning faithfulness by penalizing models that produce correct answers from flawed reasoning traces through counterfactual interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce correct answers using flawed reasoning, which undermines trustworthiness in high-stakes applications where reliable reasoning processes are crucial.

Method: Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR) introduces automated operator-level counterfactual interventions during training and penalizes models that maintain the same answer under logically invalid reasoning traces.

Result: CSR improves faithfulness by up to 70 percentage points over standard methods across arithmetic, logical deduction, and planning tasks with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes to larger models.

Conclusion: CSR effectively enhances reasoning faithfulness in LLMs through counterfactual training, works synergistically with inference methods, and can be extended to semantic perturbations for commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a structured decision-making framework for responsible AI in safety-critical domains like disaster management, achieving 60.94% greater stability than judgment-based systems and 38.93% higher accuracy than human operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical implications and ensure reliable, justifiable decision-making in safety-critical AI applications where human lives are at stake, particularly in aerospace and emergency-response domains.

Method: Developed a structured decision-making framework using Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios, implemented in autonomous decision-making for disaster management. Evaluated against judgment-based systems and human operators (victims, volunteers, stakeholders).

Result: Framework achieved 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple scenarios compared to judgment-based systems, and outperformed human operators with 38.93% higher accuracy across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The structured decision-making framework shows promise for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts, providing greater stability and accuracy than both automated judgment-based systems and human experts.

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

### [63] [Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01619)
*Abhinav Kumar,Jaechul Roh,Ali Naseh,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Bagdasarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Web Agent Throttling framework imposes computational costs on AI agents through reasoning puzzles to protect web services from overload and abuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI web agents can overload content providers, bypass CAPTCHAs, and flood authentication systems, requiring new protection mechanisms that impose asymmetric costs on agents while maintaining service accessibility.

Method: Developed Throttling Gates using rebus-based Reasoning Gates - synthetic text puzzles requiring multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge, with scalable generation and verification protocols.

Result: Achieved 9.2x computational asymmetry (response cost vs generation cost for SOTA models), successfully deployed on custom websites and MCP servers, and evaluated with real-world web agents.

Conclusion: The framework effectively throttles web agents through computational costs while discussing limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment.

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

*Chongwen Zhao,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neuron-level interpretability method that identifies safety-related knowledge neurons in LLMs and uses them to defend against jailbreak attacks through activation adjustment and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns about malicious use of LLMs for jailbreak attacks (synthesizing controlled substances, spreading disinformation) and the lack of understanding about defense mechanisms.

Method: Projects model's internal representation into interpretable vocabulary space to identify safety-related neurons, then adjusts their activation and proposes SafeTuning fine-tuning strategy to reinforce safety-critical neurons.

Result: Achieves mean attack success rate (ASR) higher than 97% through neuron activation control, and SafeTuning consistently reduces ASRs across multiple LLMs while outperforming all four baseline defenses.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks through neuron-level interpretability and targeted fine-tuning of safety-critical neurons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Result: Physics Supernova scored 23.5/30 points in IPhO 2025 theory problems, ranking 14th out of 406 contestants and surpassing the median performance of human gold medalists.

Conclusion: Principled tool integration within agent systems can deliver competitive improvements in solving challenging science problems, demonstrating AI's potential to match elite human performance in physics reasoning.

Abstract: Physics provides fundamental laws that describe and predict the natural

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semantic approach using LLMs to automatically extract privacy practices from policies and build knowledge graphs, enabling large-scale privacy policy analysis and formal policy generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users rarely read privacy policies due to complexity, creating barriers for user-centered web approaches and data sharing. Existing methods focus on compliance verification but lack scalable ways to create formal policies.

Method: Uses state-of-the-art LLMs to identify key privacy information, constructs Pr²Graph knowledge graph grounded in Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), and demonstrates conversion to formal representations like ODRL and psDToU.

Result: Created Pr²Graph for top-100 websites as public resource, enriched Policy-IE dataset with expert annotations, benchmarked LLM performance, and verified pipeline capabilities.

Conclusion: Shows promise for large-scale privacy practice analysis and web auditing, with all datasets and source code released publicly to enable reuse and improvement.

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

TL;DR: CSA is a new safety paradigm that shifts from refusal-based responses to constructive guidance, especially for vulnerable users, achieving state-of-the-art safety while maintaining helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety approaches focus too narrowly on adversarial risks and use defensive refusals, which can worsen outcomes for non-malicious users in psychological distress who need help.

Method: Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA) combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control to guide users toward safe outcomes.

Result: Oy1 (Oyster-I) achieves SOTA safety among open models, shows strong constructive engagement close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on jailbreak datasets nearing GPT-o1 levels.

Conclusion: CSA redefines model-user relationships by shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, creating systems that are both safe and meaningfully helpful for all users.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EigenBench is a black-box benchmarking method that quantifies language models' value alignment using peer judgments and EigenTrust aggregation, without requiring ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of quantitative metrics for AI value alignment by creating a method to comparatively benchmark language models' adherence to specified value systems.

Method: Uses an ensemble of models to judge each other's outputs across scenarios based on a given constitution, then aggregates these judgments using EigenTrust algorithm to produce alignment scores.

Result: The method successfully quantifies value alignment and shows that most variance in scores is explained by the prompt rather than the model, with a small residual capturing the model's inherent disposition.

Conclusion: EigenBench provides a practical framework for measuring value alignment in language models without ground truth, enabling comparative assessment of how well models adhere to specified value systems.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes mFARM framework for multi-dimensional fairness assessment in medical LLMs, with benchmarks showing models maintain fairness under quantization but degrade with reduced context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address AI alignment challenges in medical LLMs where existing fairness metrics overlook multi-dimensional medical harms and promote clinically inert models.

Method: Constructed two large benchmarks from MIMIC-IV (ED-Triage and Opioid Recommendation) with 50K+ prompts across race/gender variants. Proposed mFARM framework assessing allocational, stability, and latent disparities with aggregated fairness-accuracy balance scoring.

Result: Evaluation of 4 open-source LLMs showed mFARM captures subtle biases effectively. Models maintained robust fairness under quantization but deteriorated significantly with reduced context.

Conclusion: The mFARM framework provides comprehensive fairness assessment for medical LLMs, with benchmarks and code released to advance aligned AI in healthcare.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

TL;DR: Technology assessment professionals both use generative AI in their work and study it as a research subject, while addressing its structural risks and proposing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the dual role of generative AI in technology assessment - as both a tool for TA work and a subject of TA research, while addressing the structural problems and risks associated with its use.

Method: The paper outlines the phenomenon of generative AI, formulates requirements for its use in TA, analyzes structural causes of associated problems, and proposes solutions with feasibility assessments.

Result: The analysis reveals that while generative AI continues to develop, structurally induced risks persist. The paper provides examples of generative AI applications in TA work and proposes potential solutions.

Conclusion: Despite ongoing development of generative AI, structural risks remain constant. The article emphasizes the need for careful consideration of requirements and solutions when using generative AI in technology assessment work.

Abstract: Many scientists use generative AI in their scientific work. People working in
technology assessment (TA) are no exception. TA's approach to generative AI is
twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other
hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the
phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems

### [71] [AGI as Second Being: The Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02089)
*Maijunxian Wang,Ran Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence, arguing that true intelligence requires three conditions: generativity (creating new structures), coordination (organizing them into reasons), and sustaining (maintaining identity over time). Current AI systems lack this depth despite their breadth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that current AI systems, while broad in capabilities, remain surface-level simulations that lack the depth required for true intelligence. The paper aims to define what constitutes real intelligence beyond mere task performance.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework called Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence, which establishes three necessary conditions for true intelligence: generativity, coordination, and sustaining.

Result: The framework demonstrates that current AI systems fail to meet these three conditions and therefore cannot be considered truly intelligent, despite their wide range of capabilities.

Conclusion: True intelligence requires depth through generativity, coordination, and sustaining. If future AI systems can meet these conditions, they could potentially become a "Second Being" distinct from human existence, rather than remaining mere tools.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

### [72] [LLMs for LLMs: A Structured Prompting Methodology for Long Legal Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02241)
*Strahinja Klem,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured prompting methodology for legal document analysis using QWEN-2 LLM with chunking and heuristics, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CUAD dataset while addressing reliability and transparency issues in legal AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of LLM adoption in law due to reliability and transparency concerns, providing a cost-effective alternative to expensive fine-tuning for legal document analysis.

Method: Document chunking and augmentation for long documents, engineered prompting with QWEN-2 model, and Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting heuristics for candidate selection.

Result: Performs up to 9% better than previous methods, reaching state-of-the-art performance on CUAD dataset information retrieval task.

Conclusion: Structured prompt engineering shows great potential as an under-explored tool for ensuring AI accountability in legal domains, though current evaluation metrics remain a limiting factor.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using generative AI and multiple LLMs to extract epidemiological information from WHO Disease Outbreak News, creating a daily-updated dataset and knowledge graph (eKG) for enhanced disease surveillance and research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage AI advancements and available social media/news data to improve epidemiological surveillance and public health research by extracting actionable information from WHO outbreak reports.

Method: Ensemble approach incorporating multiple Large Language Models to process WHO Disease Outbreak News, creating structured datasets and a knowledge graph (eKG) with daily updates.

Result: Development of a comprehensive daily-updated dataset and eKG knowledge graph that provides nuanced representation of public health domain knowledge from WHO outbreak information.

Conclusion: These innovative AI-driven data resources create new opportunities for epidemiological research, disease outbreak analysis, and enhanced surveillance capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

### [74] [Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02276)
*Susana Nunes,Samy Badreddine,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REx is a novel reinforcement learning approach that generates scientific explanations for knowledge graph link predictions, specifically for drug repurposing applications, by identifying explanatory paths enriched with biomedical ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graphs are powerful for modeling complex data but need to provide meaningful scientific explanations, not just accurate predictions, to gain acceptance as credible scientific tools.

Method: Uses reward and policy mechanisms in reinforcement learning to guide an agent in identifying explanatory paths within knowledge graphs, enriched with domain-specific ontologies to ensure explanations are grounded in biomedical knowledge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predictive performance on three knowledge graph benchmarks and generates explanations that validate predictive insights against biomedical knowledge.

Conclusion: REx represents a significant contribution to advancing AI-driven scientific discovery by providing both accurate predictions and scientifically meaningful explanations.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [75] [Re-evaluating LLM-based Heuristic Search: A Case Study on the 3D Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02297)
*Guorui Quan,Mingfei Sun,Manuel López-Ibáñez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate heuristic code but struggle with complete solver design. With constraint scaffolding and iterative self-correction, LLMs focused mainly on scoring functions, producing results comparable to human-designed algorithms but showing limitations in complex constraint scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can go beyond simple code generation and demonstrate broader innovation in automated heuristic design, specifically for complex problems like the constrained 3D Packing Problem.

Method: Used constraint scaffolding (prewritten constraint-checking code) and iterative self-correction (refinement cycles to repair bugs) to support LLM in building a complete solver. The LLM primarily focused on refining scoring functions within a greedy process.

Result: The LLM-generated heuristic was comparable to human-designed greedy algorithms. When integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, it rivaled established solvers, though performance decreased with tighter constraints.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face two major barriers in automated heuristic design: engineering requirements to mitigate fragility in complex reasoning, and pretrained biases that prematurely narrow solution search, limiting broader innovation capabilities.

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

### [76] [Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02308)
*Taegyeong Lee,Jiwon Park,Kyunga Bang,Seunghyun Hwang,Ung-Jin Jang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using text-to-image diffusion models to generate stock chart predictions by treating time-series data as images with instruction prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial domain relies heavily on time-series data and transformers, lacking diverse generative model applications despite advances in text-to-image/video generation.

Method: Treat time-series data as image patterns, use diffusion models to generate next chart image from current chart and instruction prompt, introduce evaluation method for generated vs ground truth images.

Result: Demonstrated potential of text-to-image generative models for financial applications, specifically stock price trend prediction through chart generation.

Conclusion: Text-to-image generative models show promise in financial domain, motivating further research to address limitations and expand applicability beyond current methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

### [77] [Explainability-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02340)
*Salma Haidar,José Oramas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model-driven band selection using post-hoc explainability methods to identify influential spectral bands in hyperspectral imaging, achieving comparable accuracy with only 30 bands instead of full spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging suffers from high dimensionality and computational burden, requiring effective dimensionality reduction while preserving classification performance.

Method: Using trained classifiers with explanation methods to quantify band contributions, performing deletion-insertion evaluations to measure confidence changes, and aggregating signals into influence scores for band selection.

Result: Classifiers trained on just 30 selected bands matched or exceeded full-spectrum baselines on Pavia University and Salinas benchmarks, with reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: Explanation-guided band selection provides a principled approach to effective dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging, producing compact spectral subsets that align with physically meaningful wavelength regions.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

*Shubham Gandhi,Jason Tsay,Jatin Ganhotra,Kiran Kate,Yara Rizk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWE-PRM is a process reward model that detects and corrects inefficiencies in LLM agents during software engineering tasks, improving success rates by 10.6 percentage points with minimal added cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents deployed for complex software engineering tasks often exhibit costly inefficiencies like redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate after finding solutions. Current approaches only diagnose these errors post-execution rather than intervening during the process.

Method: SWE-PRM is an inference-time Process Reward Model that intervenes during execution to detect trajectory-level errors. It leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and provides lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy.

Result: On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improved resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Taxonomy-guided PRMs outperformed unguided variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length, with added inference cost as low as $0.2.

Conclusion: PRMs provide a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency, offering significant performance improvements with acceptable computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware LLM agent improves biomedical data summarization by leveraging retrieval and summary uncertainty signals, achieving significant improvements in factuality and downstream prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often produce overconfident outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table biomedical data, leading to unreliable results in structured data environments.

Method: Introduces uncertainty-aware agent with two complementary signals: retrieval uncertainty (entropy over table-selection rollouts) and summary uncertainty (self-consistency + perplexity). Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for RL and inference-time filtering.

Result: Nearly triples correct claims per summary (3.0→8.4 internal; 3.6→9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improves downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32→0.63).

Conclusion: Uncertainty serves as an effective control signal, enabling agents to abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex structured-data environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

TL;DR: AppCopilot is a multimodal, multi-agent on-device assistant that addresses four core mobile agent challenges: generalization, accuracy, long-horizon capability, and efficiency through an end-to-end system with multimodal foundation models, hierarchical planning, and optimization for mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mobile-agent landscape lacks convergence on fundamental challenges despite rapid AI advancements. Four core problems need solving: generalization across tasks/modalities/apps/devices, precise interaction accuracy, long-horizon task capability, and efficient runtime on constrained devices.

Method: AppCopilot uses an end-to-end autonomous pipeline with multimodal foundation models (Chinese-English support), chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning, multi-agent collaboration, and execution layer features including personalization, voice interaction, function calling, and cross-app orchestration with hardware optimization.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements across all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime performance.

Conclusion: AppCopilot demonstrates a comprehensive solution to mobile agent challenges through its full-stack, closed-loop system design that operationalizes practical mobile AI assistance with multimodal capabilities and device optimization.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Motivation: Address challenges in autonomous GUI agents including data scalability issues, multi-turn reinforcement learning difficulties, limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability problems.

Method: Uses a systematic training methodology with: data flywheel for scalable data generation, stabilized multi-turn RL framework, hybrid GUI environment integrating file systems and terminals, and unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts.

Result: Achieves 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, 73.3 on AndroidWorld, and 59.8 mean normalized score across 15 games (60% human-level performance). Outperforms Claude and OpenAI agents.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2 demonstrates significant improvements over previous models, shows strong generalization to diverse agent tasks, and provides insights for achieving stability in large-scale agent RL, advancing the state of GUI agents.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

TL;DR: Survey paper formalizing the paradigm shift from LLM-based reinforcement learning to agentic RL, proposing a taxonomy of agent capabilities and applications, with RL as the key mechanism for adaptive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the conceptual shift from traditional LLM reinforcement learning (passive sequence generation) to agentic RL (autonomous decision-making agents in complex environments) and provide a comprehensive framework for this emerging field.

Method: Proposes a twofold taxonomy: 1) core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, perception) and 2) applications across diverse task domains. Contrasts single-step MDPs of LLM-RL with temporally extended POMDPs of Agentic RL.

Result: Synthesizes over 500 recent works to chart the rapidly evolving field, consolidating open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium for future research.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming static capabilities into adaptive agentic behavior, with opportunities and challenges for developing scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

*Abu Shad Ahammed,Sayeri Mukherjee,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Research on using machine learning and LLMs to diagnose psychiatric disorders from behavioral patterns in emergency rescue data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental disorders are often misdiagnosed due to lack of visible symptoms, making emergency identification challenging but crucial for patient care

Method: Collected data from emergency psychiatric patients at a German rescue station, tested various ML models including Llama 3.1 to assess predictive capabilities for mental disorder identification

Result: Not specified in the abstract

Conclusion: Not specified in the abstract

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A defense method that perturbs model parameters during export to prevent data exfiltration attacks while maintaining utility performance in medical data lakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data lakes enable powerful ML models on sensitive medical data but introduce serious privacy risks from data exfiltration attacks that can reconstruct high-fidelity medical images through model parameter embedding or multi-task learning memorization.

Method: A mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt embedded data without degrading task performance.

Result: Evaluations on DermaMNIST, ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show the approach maintains utility performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks, outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical defense against data leakage in data lake-trained models and centralized federated learning, with ablations and adaptive attack discussions highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

### [86] [ZeroQAT: Your Quantization-aware Training but Efficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00031)
*Qitao Tan,Xiaoying Song,Jin Lu,Guoming Li,Jun Liu,Lingzi Hong,Caiwen Ding,Jundong Li,Xiaoming Zhai,Shaoyi Huang,Wei Niu,Geng Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroQAT is a zeroth-order optimization-based quantization-aware training framework that eliminates backpropagation while maintaining QAT accuracy with PTQ efficiency for LLM quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-bit post-training quantization methods suffer from accuracy degradation due to cumulative error propagation and misalignment issues, while quantization-aware training is too computationally expensive due to backpropagation requirements.

Method: Leverages forward-only gradient estimation using zeroth-order optimization to eliminate backpropagation, jointly learning quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and equivalent transformations to handle quantization error and activation outliers.

Result: ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of post-training quantization while retaining the accuracy of quantization-aware training, providing high-quality low-bit quantization for large language models.

Conclusion: ZeroQAT offers a practical solution that bridges the gap between PTQ efficiency and QAT accuracy, making high-quality quantization more accessible by significantly reducing computational and memory overhead.

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

TL;DR: Transfer learning framework using 16nm legacy data and on-chip sensor features for accurate V_min prediction at 5nm node


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate chip performance prediction is critical for energy efficiency and reliability, but challenging at advanced nodes due to limited training data and complex process variation relationships

Method: Novel transfer learning framework leveraging abundant 16nm legacy data, integrated with input features from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data for fine-grained characterization of localized process variations

Result: Significantly improved prediction accuracy for minimum operating voltage (V_min) at the 5nm technology node

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning approach with sensor-derived features effectively addresses data limitations and complex variation challenges in advanced semiconductor manufacturing

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

### [89] [A-FloPS: Accelerating Diffusion Sampling with Adaptive Flow Path Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00036)
*Cheng Jin,Zhenyu Xiao,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-FloPS is a training-free acceleration method that reparameterizes diffusion model sampling trajectories into flow-matching form with adaptive velocity decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art performance with as few as 5 function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generative performance but remain computationally expensive due to their iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods are limited by inefficient sampling trajectories.

Method: Proposes A-FloPS framework that reparameterizes sampling trajectories into flow-matching form and augments with adaptive velocity decomposition. Maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible velocities and factorizes velocity field into linear drift and residual components.

Result: Extensive experiments show A-FloPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free samplers in sample quality and efficiency. Achieves substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images with only 5 function evaluations.

Conclusion: A-FloPS is a versatile and effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling, also improving native flow-based generative models, demonstrating its generality.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

### [90] [Exploring and Reshaping the Weight Distribution in LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00046)
*Chunming Ye,Songzhou Li,Xu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes weight distribution correlations across LLM layers, finds power-law distributions in cosine distances, proposes a data generator to create aligned weights, and improves LoRA training performance through weight reshaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how weight distribution characteristics across different layers in large language models affect LoRA training effectiveness, and leverage these insights to improve training performance.

Method: Analyzed cosine distances between weights of different layers using SVD on weight matrices from self-attention and MLP layers. Proposed a qualitative method for distribution characterization, designed a Gaussian process + Pareto distribution data generator, and reshaped LoRA initialization weights based on distribution characteristics.

Result: Discovered that cosine distances between weights of different layers follow power-law distribution. Experimental results show that reshaping LoRA initialization weights according to these distribution characteristics improves training performance without changing model structure or training process.

Conclusion: The distribution characteristics of weights across different layers in LLMs significantly impact LoRA training effectiveness, and leveraging these characteristics through proper weight initialization can enhance training performance.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

*Jina Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Internal replay mechanism inspired by brain memory consolidation helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, but reduces initial task accuracy and increases representational overlap, creating a trade-off between stability and plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks during continual learning by drawing inspiration from human brain's memory consolidation processes, specifically focusing on internal replay mechanisms.

Method: Evaluated internal replay mechanism (both standalone and combined with Synaptic Intelligence) using CIFAR-100 dataset in class-incremental setting. Analyzed results using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections.

Result: Internal replay significantly reduces forgetting, especially when paired with Synaptic Intelligence, but decreases initial task accuracy. Analysis shows increased representational overlap in latent space, limiting task-specific differentiation.

Conclusion: Current brain-inspired methods have limitations in balancing retention and adaptability. The study reveals a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity, suggesting need for future approaches to better balance these competing objectives.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive physics-informed neural network with multi-category feature engineering achieves highly accurate hydrogen sorption prediction (R2=0.979) across clays, shales, and coals, enabling faster site screening and risk-informed decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional experimental methods for hydrogen sorption prediction are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing geological heterogeneity, which hinders underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and radioactive waste containment.

Method: Developed an adaptive physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework integrating classical isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints. Used deep residual networks with multi-head attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout. Employed comprehensive dataset of 155 samples with multi-category feature engineering across seven categories.

Robust lithology-specific performance: clays (R2=0.981), shales (R2=0.971), coals (R2=0.978) with 85-91% reliability scores. 86.7% of feature pairs show strong interactions.

Conclusion: The adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches for hydrogen sorption prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

*David Kurtenbach,Megan Manly,Zach Metzinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning anomaly detection applied to Russian space objects reveals statistically significant behavioral changes before Ukraine invasion, providing potential early warning indicators for future conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect early warning signs of aggressive military behavior by analyzing anomalous activity patterns of Russian-owned space objects prior to the Ukraine invasion using publicly available satellite data.

Method: Used multiple deep learning approaches (isolation forest, traditional autoencoder, variational autoencoder, Kolmogorov Arnold Network, and novel anchor-loss autoencoder) on five years of two-line element data, training individual models for each space object to analyze six orbital elements separately for explainability.

Result: Identified statistically significant anomalies in Russian RSO activity patterns, with detailed anomalous findings at the individual orbital element level during the six months leading up to the February 2022 invasion.

Conclusion: Deep learning anomaly detection can successfully identify pre-conflict behavioral changes in space objects, providing valuable indications and warnings for future military conflicts through explainable analysis of orbital patterns.

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

TL;DR: L2C is a meta-learning framework that learns hyperparameters for ADMM-DDP distributed trajectory optimization, enabling adaptive coordination across diverse multi-agent tasks with faster gradient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination, which is challenging and time-consuming.

Method: Proposes Learning to Coordinate (L2C) framework with agent-wise neural networks to meta-learn hyperparameters, differentiates end-to-end through ADMM-DDP pipeline, reuses DDP components for efficient meta-gradient computation, and uses truncated iterations with optimized ADMM penalty parameters.

Result: L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, adapts to varying team sizes and task conditions, and achieves up to 88% faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: L2C provides a general framework for meta-learning coordination hyperparameters that enables robust adaptation across diverse multi-agent tasks while significantly improving computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe class imbalance in optical network failure management where normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, with post-processing methods being largely unexplored compared to pre- and in-processing techniques.

Method: Direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class imbalance mitigation using experimental dataset, evaluating methods like Threshold Adjustment, Random Under-Sampling, SMOTE, Meta-Learning, and Generative AI approaches.

Result: For failure detection: post-processing methods (Threshold Adjustment) achieve highest F1 score improvement (up to 15.3%), Random Under-Sampling provides fastest inference. For failure identification: GenAI methods deliver most substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), post-processing shows limited impact in multi-class settings.

Conclusion: Method effectiveness depends on scenario: with class overlap and latency critical - SMOTE most effective; without latency constraints - Meta-Learning best; low-overlap scenarios - Generative AI provides highest performance with minimal inference time.

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

TL;DR: T-MLP extends standard MLP with multiple output branches (tails) to enable multi-scale level-of-detail signal representation, outperforming existing neural LoD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs operate at a single scale and lack native support for level-of-detail representation, which is critical for efficient modeling and transmission of signals like images and 3D shapes.

Method: Propose Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that attaches multiple output branches to hidden layers, enabling direct supervision at multiple depths through specialized loss formulation and training strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments show T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across various signal representation tasks.

Conclusion: The T-MLP architecture successfully enables multi-scale level-of-detail representation by extending standard MLPs with multiple supervised output branches, providing effective multi-scale modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

### [98] [VariAntNet: Learning Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02271)
*Yigal Koifman,Erez Koifman,Eran Iceland,Ariel Barel,Alfred M. Bruckstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VariAntNet is a deep learning-based decentralized control model for simple robotic swarms that significantly outperforms traditional analytical methods in multi-agent gathering tasks, achieving faster convergence while maintaining swarm cohesion in disaster response scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining swarm cohesion and avoiding fragmentation in simple robotic agents (Ant Robots) with limited sensing and no communication capabilities, particularly for time-critical disaster response applications like firefighting where traditional analytical methods are too slow.

Method: VariAntNet uses deep learning with geometric feature extraction from unordered local observations, a neural network architecture trained with a novel differentiable multi-objective loss function that leverages visibility graph Laplacian matrix properties to promote swarm cohesiveness.

Result: VariAntNet achieves more than double the convergence rate compared to existing analytical solutions while maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes, making it practical for emergency response operations.

Conclusion: The paper presents a trade-off analysis showing that in time-critical scenarios like emergency response, the faster performance of VariAntNet justifies potential minor agent losses compared to slower but guaranteed-cohesion analytical methods.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

TL;DR: SynCircuit is a novel framework that generates synthetic circuit data in HDL format using diffusion models and MCTS optimization to overcome the data scarcity problem in AI-assisted IC design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available circuit design data has become the primary bottleneck for developing AI-assisted IC design methods, limiting progress in this field.

Method: A three-step framework: 1) Customized diffusion-based generative model for Directed Cyclic Graph generation, 2) Circuit constraint enforcement through graph refinement, 3) Monte Carlo tree search optimization to reduce logic redundancy.

Result: Experimental results show SynCircuit can generate realistic synthetic circuits and improve ML model performance in downstream circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: SynCircuit successfully addresses the circuit data scarcity problem and demonstrates the feasibility of synthetic data generation for enhancing AI-assisted IC design methods.

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: This work represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques specifically for managing clinician data overload caused by the complexities of combined RPM and EHR data systems.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language

landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

TL;DR: Multi-layered AI/ML architecture successfully distinguishes cybersecurity events from operational anomalies in nuclear reactor using combined IT/OT data streams, achieving high classification accuracy but facing synchronization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on applying AI/ML in functioning nuclear reactors despite potential benefits for anomaly detection, failure anticipation, and cybersecurity in the nuclear industry.

Method: Developed a multi-layered AI/ML architecture integrating both information technology and operational technology data streams. Tested on Purdue University's research reactor (PUR-1) with 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and over 13.8 million multi-variate data points, including concurrent false data injections and denial-of-service attacks.

Result: AI/ML successfully distinguished between normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events even during denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and IT data improved classification accuracy but introduced synchronization and collection challenges during cyber events.

Conclusion: AI/ML shows significant promise for nuclear cybersecurity but requires further refinement for complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures, particularly addressing data synchronization issues during cyber attacks.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

*Laksh Patel,Neel Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenDataCarto is a framework that analyzes training data using difficulty and memorization scores to identify and mitigate overfitting in generative models through targeted data pruning and weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models risk memorizing rare training examples, which can be exploited by adversaries or artificially inflate benchmark performance, creating security and evaluation concerns.

Method: Assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and memorization score (frequency of forget events), then partitions data into four quadrants to guide pruning and weighting strategies.

Result: Reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40% with just 10% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5%.

Conclusion: Principled data interventions can significantly mitigate data leakage with minimal impact on generative performance, providing effective protection against memorization-based attacks.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSR is a parallel test-time scaling framework that enables LLMs to generate multiple candidate responses and then self-refine them into superior solutions through joint training on direct problem-solving and refinement objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N and majority voting are limited by candidate response quality and require additional models for selection, which increases deployment costs. There's a need for a more effective and cost-efficient approach.

Method: Generative Self-Refinement (GSR) framework where a unified model generates candidate responses in parallel and then performs self-refinement using those candidates. A hybrid training pipeline jointly optimizes for direct problem-solving and candidate refinement objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. The learned self-refinement skill is model-agnostic, robust across different model scales, and generalizes to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GSR provides an effective test-time scaling solution that overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling LLMs to self-refine their responses without requiring additional models, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Learning with FedProx algorithm achieves 61.23% accuracy for student performance prediction while preserving privacy under Brazil's data protection laws, with only marginal performance loss compared to centralized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy legislation like Brazil's LGPD restricts centralized collection of sensitive student data, creating barriers for educational data mining and AI applications that require privacy-preserving computational approaches.

Method: Used Federated Learning (FedProx algorithm) with Deep Neural Network trained across 50 simulated schools, benchmarked against centralized XGBoost model on over 2 million student records from Brazilian Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB).

Result: Centralized XGBoost achieved 63.96% accuracy, while federated model reached 61.23% accuracy - showing only marginal performance loss while providing robust privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: Federated Learning is a viable and effective solution for collaborative predictive modeling in Brazilian educational context that complies with LGPD privacy requirements.

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes three enhancements to LSTM models: input reordering to prioritize certain indices, weight normalization with optimal Lp norms, and nonlinearized gates using small FFNNs. These improvements boost text classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LSTMs don't optimally focus on specific old information, lack proper weight normalization techniques, and have gates that aren't sufficiently nonlinearized to handle peculiar input patterns.

Method: Three main approaches: 1) Input reordering to prioritize certain indices, 2) Weight normalization with optimal Lp norms selected through supervised loss, 3) Nonlinearized gates using small feedforward neural networks to better filter information.

Result: The proposed approaches improve LSTM accuracy in text classification tasks compared to standard LSTM models.

Conclusion: The enhancements - input reordering, optimal weight normalization, and nonlinearized gates - collectively improve LSTM performance by better handling long-term information and input-specific nonlinearities.

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

TL;DR: CEAT improves ensemble adversarial training by focusing on samples with classification disparities between sub-models, using adaptive weighting and distance regularization to enhance cooperation and achieve state-of-the-art robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) methods train sub-models independently, missing the cooperative benefits between models. Samples with classification disparities between sub-models are found to be near decision boundaries and crucial for ensemble robustness.

Method: Proposes Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT) that emphasizes samples with larger predictive disparities between sub-models. Uses probability disparities to adaptively weight samples and incorporates calibrating distance regularization during adversarial training.

Result: Extensive experiments show CEAT achieves state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT methods on widely-adopted datasets. The method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: CEAT successfully enhances ensemble robustness by promoting cooperative learning among sub-models through adaptive sample weighting based on predictive disparities, demonstrating superior performance and broad applicability across different ensemble methods.

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked challenge of detecting synthetic tabular data in real-world conditions where tables have heterogeneous structures and unseen formats, which is more difficult than image/text detection.

Method: Introduces a datum-wise transformer architecture with table-adaptation component to handle variable and previously unseen table schemas.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous baseline with 7-point improvements in both AUC and accuracy, plus additional 7 accuracy points from table-adaptation for enhanced robustness.

Conclusion: First strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in real-world conditions is feasible and can be done with high reliability.

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

TL;DR: Hybrid RL framework with Dirichlet stochasticity and quantum genetic optimization for dynamic budget allocation, achieving near-perfect alignment with actual Apple financial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with stochastic and nonlinear financial data, requiring more adaptive approaches that can handle real-world complexity.

Method: Reinforcement learning agent trained on Apple quarterly data (2009-2025) with Dirichlet distribution for state evolution and L2 penalties for realistic allocations, refined with genetic algorithms using quantum mutation via qubit rotation circuits.

Result: Achieves high alignment with actual allocations on unseen data (cosine similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating effective policy convergence.

Conclusion: Combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics shows promise for adaptive enterprise budgeting systems.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural network pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features needed for lie detection. The paper proposes TPLO (Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers) to preserve both performance and lie detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning LLMs for deployment in low-resource scenarios inadvertently removes crucial internal activation features that are essential for lie detection using probing classifiers.

Method: Proposes TPLO approach that emphasizes layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. Also introduces a prompting rule to enrich TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibration.

Result: Achieves 88% accuracy for hallucination detection at 50% sparsity while maintaining original LLM performance and improving TruthfulQA results.

Conclusion: TPLO successfully preserves critical inner state features needed for robust lie detection while enabling effective LLM pruning, addressing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in pruned models.

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

*Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEGE is a novel gradient estimation method that improves neural network quantization by progressively replacing full-precision values with quantized ones and co-optimizing task loss with discretization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods using Straight-Through Estimator (STE) overlook discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, leading to accuracy degradation especially at low bit-widths.

Method: Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE) uses logarithmic curriculum-driven mixed-precision replacement strategy and formulates QAT as co-optimization of task loss and discretization error.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across ResNet and VGG architectures show PEGE consistently outperforms existing methods and enables low-precision models to match or exceed full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: PEGE provides a unified and generalizable framework for quantization-aware training that effectively addresses discretization errors and improves quantized model performance.

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-QUBO is an end-to-end framework that automates the translation of natural language optimization problems into QUBO format using LLMs and employs hybrid quantum-classical decomposition to overcome quantum hardware limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum annealing faces two major challenges: manual QUBO formulation from natural language descriptions and scalability limitations of current quantum hardware, hindering practical applications.

Method: Uses LLM to parse natural language and generate mathematical representations, then applies hybrid Benders' decomposition to partition problems into QUBO master problems (for quantum) and linear sub-problems (for classical solvers).

Result: The framework successfully automates QUBO generation and demonstrates scalability through classical solver validation, establishing a robust baseline for quantum hardware readiness.

Conclusion: LLM-QUBO provides an automated workflow that bridges classical AI and quantum computing, significantly reducing entry barriers and enabling quantum devices as accessible accelerators for real-world optimization problems.

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for

### [112] [Exploiting a Mixture-of-Layers in an Electrocardiography Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00102)
*Phu X. Nguyen,Huy Phan,Hieu Pham,Christos Chatzichristos,Bert Vandenberk,Maarten De Vos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PMA, a method that aggregates representations from multiple Transformer layers instead of just the final layer, improving ECG foundation model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based ECG models show impressive performance but their internal layer representations are not fully understood or exploited. The final layer may not provide optimal performance for downstream tasks.

Method: Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA) uses a gating network to selectively fuse representations from all pretrained model layers. Also extends to pretraining stage by aggregating representations before feeding to decoder.

Result: The approach enhances representation power and improves performance in downstream ECG applications compared to using only the final layer.

Conclusion: Leveraging representation diversity across Transformer layers through selective fusion provides better performance than relying solely on the final layer representation.

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

*Robert MacKnight,Jose Emilio Regio,Jeffrey G. Ethier,Luke A. Baldwin,Gabe Gomes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-guided optimization matches or exceeds Bayesian optimization performance in chemical reaction optimization, particularly in complex categorical spaces with scarce high-performing conditions, while maintaining higher exploration diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models can fundamentally change the paradigm of black-box parameter optimization in experimental chemistry, moving beyond traditional algorithmic search methods.

Method: Benchmarked LLM-guided optimization against Bayesian optimization and random sampling across six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768-5,684 experiments), using a topology-agnostic information theory framework to quantify sampling diversity.

Result: LLMs consistently matched or exceeded BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increased and high-performing conditions became scarce (<5% of space). LLMs maintained systematically higher exploration entropy than BO while achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: LLM-guided optimization excels where traditional methods struggle - in complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than mathematical optimization, with pre-trained knowledge enabling more effective navigation of chemical parameter space.

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

### [114] [Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00174)
*Pedro Savarese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis develops principled approximation methods to improve deep learning efficiency, focusing on model compression, architecture design, and optimization for discrete/non-differentiable constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large deep learning models have high computational and energy demands that create deployment barriers, requiring efficient methods that handle discrete constraints and non-differentiability.

Method: Three approaches: 1) Novel differentiable approximations for pruning/quantization enabling gradient-based compression training, 2) Neural architecture search with parameter sharing for recurrent architectures, 3) Adaptive optimization with improved hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative tasks show significant improvements in training/inference efficiency while maintaining or improving model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed scalable and principled approximations effectively tackle computationally hard problems, enabling more efficient deep learning deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

### [115] [FNODE: Flow-Matching for data-driven simulation of constrained multibody systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00183)
*Hongyu Wang,Jingquan Wang,Dan Negrut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FNODE framework learns acceleration vector fields directly from trajectory data, eliminating ODE solver backpropagation bottlenecks and achieving superior performance on multibody systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy in data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems.

Method: Flow-Matching Neural ODE that supervises accelerations instead of integrated states, using numerical differentiation (FFT/FD hybrid scheme) to compute acceleration targets efficiently.

Result: Outperforms MBD-NODE, LSTM, and FCNN across multiple benchmarks (mass-spring-damper, double pendulum, slider-crank, cart-pole) with good accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FNODE provides an effective solution for constrained multibody system modeling by directly learning acceleration vector fields, achieving both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

*Hao Mark Chen,Zhiwen Mo,Guanxi Lu,Shuang Liang,Lingxiao Ma,Wayne Luk,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashTTS enables efficient test-time scaling for edge AI by optimizing memory allocation and scheduling, allowing small LLMs on consumer GPUs to match cloud model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices need agentic AI for privacy and responsiveness, but memory constraints force the use of smaller LLMs with inferior reasoning. Existing test-time scaling methods have prohibitive overhead on edge hardware.

Method: FlashTTS introduces three optimizations: Speculative Beam Extension to handle irregular reasoning paths, Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation to balance memory between generation and verification, and Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache reuse.

Result: FlashTTS achieves 2.2x higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to vLLM baseline, enabling edge LLMs on 24GB consumer GPUs to match cloud model accuracy and latency.

Conclusion: FlashTTS makes test-time scaling practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning, paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

### [117] [From TLinFormer to TConstFormer: The Leap to Constant-Time Transformer Attention: Achieving O(1) Computation and O(1) KV Cache during Autoregressive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00202)
*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TConstFormer achieves constant-size KV cache and O(1) computational complexity through periodic state updates, enabling efficient ultra-long sequence processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from linearly growing KV cache and O(N^2 d) computational complexity, limiting their ability to process ultra-long sequences efficiently.

Method: Uses periodic state update mechanism with constant-time computations for k-1 steps and single linear-time global synchronization on the k-th step.

Result: Demonstrates overwhelming advantages in speed, memory efficiency, and performance on long-text inference tasks compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Enables efficient and robust streaming language model applications by solving the KV cache growth problem.

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

TL;DR: Neptune is a novel method for inferring parameter fields in PDEs from sparse measurements, outperforming existing approaches like PINNs by reducing errors significantly and enabling accurate predictions beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter estimation methods struggle with nonlinear, spatiotemporal parameter variations in PDEs, especially with limited observations, nonlinear dynamics, and multiphysics interactions.

Method: Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or state variables, enabling robust parameter inference from sparse measurements.

Result: Neptune significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor of ten compared to PINNs.

Conclusion: Neptune enables reliable and data-efficient parameter inference with superior extrapolation capabilities, promising transformative impacts across engineering, healthcare, and other domains where direct parameter measurements are difficult or expensive.

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems like Megatron-LM use static heuristics that separately configure parallelism strategies, leaving significant performance untapped as models scale and hardware diversifies.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with an attention-based policy over an elite history to learn from high-performing strategies and efficiently navigate the combinatorial search space.

Result: Achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters.

Conclusion: The RL-based co-optimization approach significantly outperforms existing static heuristics for distributed LLM inference across diverse hardware topologies and large model scales.

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Speech foundation models like HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 produce domain-independent representations that achieve state-of-the-art performance on wearable sensor time series tasks, outperforming modality-specific self-supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether speech foundation models can learn generalized representations that work across different time-series domains, particularly for data-scarce wearable sensor tasks where traditional approaches may be limited.

Method: Using pre-trained speech foundation models (HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0) to extract features from wearable sensor time series data, then training simple probes on these features for classification tasks including mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification.

Result: Speech model features significantly outperform features from modality-specific self-supervised models across all tasks. The convolutional feature encoders from speech models show particularly strong relevance for wearable sensor applications.

Conclusion: Speech foundation models provide domain-independent representations that improve performance and robustness for data-scarce time series tasks, suggesting a path toward generalized time series models for both speech and sensor data.

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

*Stefan-Alexandru Jura,Mihai Udrescu,Alexandru Topirceanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SSM is a quantum-optimized state space model that uses variational quantum gates instead of attention mechanisms for improved long-range time series forecasting with better stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Transformer-based models (quadratic complexity, degraded long-horizon performance) and state space models (unstable training, sensitivity to initialization) in long-range time series forecasting.

Method: Hybrid quantum-optimized approach integrating state space dynamics with variational quantum gate (RY-RX ansatz) whose expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively, replacing expensive attention mechanisms.

Result: Q-SSM consistently outperforms strong baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba on ETT, Traffic, and Exchange Rate benchmarks.

Conclusion: Variational quantum gating effectively addresses current limitations in long-range forecasting, providing accurate and robust multivariate predictions with improved convergence stability.

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLATE is a reinforcement learning framework that automatically generates optimized sparse tensor representations for tensor decomposition, achieving up to 2x speedup over expert-designed formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-designed sparse tensor formats fail to adapt to irregular tensor shapes and variable data distributions, leading to suboptimal performance in tensor decomposition tasks.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with an autonomous agent that discovers efficient tensor encodings through interaction with the environment, employing hybrid model-free/model-based algorithms and incorporating rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed filtering.

Result: Achieves up to 2x speedup compared to best sparse formats, with geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46x across diverse sparse tensor datasets.

Conclusion: ReLATE demonstrates that learning-based approaches can automatically generate superior sparse tensor representations that outperform expert-designed formats while ensuring functional correctness and bounded execution time.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes continuously tempered diffusion samplers that use temperature-based exploration to improve neural sampling from unnormalized distributions, addressing insufficient exploration issues in previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous annealing-based neural samplers suffer from insufficient exploration due to isolated modes and pathological properties in the annealing path, leading to poor performance after training.

Method: Introduces a family of distributions across different temperatures to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and drive exploration at the target temperature, leveraging techniques from molecular dynamics.

Result: Empirical validation shows improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration capabilities compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: Continuously tempered diffusion samplers effectively address exploration limitations in neural sampling by incorporating temperature-based exploration strategies, leading to better performance in sampling from complex distributions.

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

*Renat Sergazinov,Shao-An Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN v2 outperforms tree-based models on tabular benchmarks but is limited to 10K tokens due to transformer quadratic costs. The paper introduces a tiled-block strategy for efficient attention computation, enabling TabPFN to handle long contexts without pre-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TabPFN v2 shows superior performance over traditional tree-based models for tabular data but suffers from computational limitations that prevent handling large contexts, requiring a solution that maintains performance while scaling to longer sequences.

Method: A tiled-block strategy is introduced to compute attention within the TabPFN framework, avoiding context compression methods like KNN sampling and enabling efficient computation on standard GPU setups without pre-processing.

Result: The approach successfully enables TabPFN to process long contexts without pre-processing, demonstrating effectiveness on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Conclusion: The tiled-block strategy provides a practical solution to TabPFN's context limitations, making it viable for larger tabular datasets while maintaining competitive performance against tree-based models.

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

TL;DR: A pipeline combining IPS-weighted training with BPR objective and propensity regularizer to address exposure bias in recommender systems, reducing variance while improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address exposure bias in recommender systems from logged implicit feedback, where standard IPS methods suffer from high variance and instability.

Method: Integrates IPS-weighted training with IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer. Compares DM, IPS, and SNIPS for offline policy evaluation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens 100K data show better generalization under unbiased exposure and reduced evaluation variance compared to naive and standard IPS methods.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for counterfactual learning and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings, offering more stable estimates through the proposed propensity regularizer.

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

### [126] [Are We Really Learning the Score Function? Reinterpreting Diffusion Models Through Wasserstein Gradient Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00336)
*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models don't actually learn true score functions as commonly assumed, but still work well because they're better understood as flow matching to Wasserstein Gradient Flow velocity fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the paradox that diffusion models perform well despite violating mathematical constraints of true score functions, and to provide a more accurate theoretical framework for understanding how they work.

Method: Numerical analysis showing trained diffusion networks violate conservative vector field constraints, and proposing a new theoretical perspective based on Wasserstein Gradient Flow framework rather than score function learning.

Result: Demonstrated that neural vector fields in diffusion models are not conservative (not true scores), but generative sampling remains successful because the models effectively perform flow matching to WGF velocity fields.

Conclusion: The Wasserstein Gradient Flow perspective provides a more principled and theoretically grounded framework for understanding diffusion models, explaining why they work well even when not learning true score functions.

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

*Hanping Zhang,Yuhong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD) enhances offline RL generalization using text and trajectory prompts processed by LLMs and transformers to guide policy learning through diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL agents struggle to generalize to new tasks due to limited offline data and lack of online environments, requiring better methods to leverage available datasets for improved generalization.

Method: Combines text-based task descriptions (processed by LLM) and trajectory prompts (encoded by transformer) as conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model for RL policy learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, demonstrating effective generalization and adaptability in diverse settings.

Conclusion: LLMDPD successfully addresses offline RL generalization challenges by leveraging multimodal prompts and diffusion models, providing a robust framework for task adaptation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

*Shixiao Liang,Wang Chen,Keke Long,Peng Zhang,Xiaopeng Li,Jintao Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical justification for Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL), proving why it requires fewer parameters, converges faster, and needs less training data than pure neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous numerical studies showed PERL's advantages but lacked theoretical explanation. The authors aim to provide rigorous mathematical proofs for why PERL outperforms pure neural networks.

Method: The study investigates problems with Lipschitz continuity properties and examines relationships between loss function bounds and residual learning structure to prove theorems explaining PERL's advantages.

Result: The paper proves theorems explaining PERL's three advantages and validates them with numerical examples in vehicle trajectory prediction, showing PERL achieves higher accuracy with fewer training samples.

Conclusion: PERL improves predictive performance while reducing data requirements, making it valuable for real-world autonomous driving applications where corner case data is scarce or expensive.

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

*Hyungu Lee,Taehyeong Kim,Hayoung Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonal initialization optimized for ReLU networks that prevents dying ReLU problem and stabilizes training in deep architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard initialization methods (He, Xavier, orthogonal) don't properly regulate pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity, and their effectiveness diminishes in very deep ReLU networks, leading to gradient instability and neuron inactivation.

Method: Developed an orthogonal initialization by solving optimization on Stiefel manifold to preserve scale and calibrate pre-activation statistics. Derived closed-form solutions and efficient sampling scheme.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows prevention of dying ReLU, slower activation variance decay, and mitigation of gradient vanishing. Empirically outperforms previous methods across multiple datasets and enables stable deep network training.

Conclusion: The proposed orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU networks effectively stabilizes signal and gradient flow in deep architectures, addressing limitations of existing initialization methods.

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

### [131] [Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00387)
*Jinluan Yang,Ruihao Zhang,Zhengyu Chen,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerturbEmbedding is a novel adversarial training method that applies perturbations directly to GNN hidden embeddings, providing a unified framework for enhancing robustness against both random and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods for GNNs are limited to specific datasets and model types, lacking a unified approach to handle various perturbation strategies and improve generalization.

Method: PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs, offering a unified framework that encompasses most existing perturbation strategies including both random and adversarial perturbations.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and backbone models show that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective unified approach for adversarial training in GNNs, enhancing resilience to attacks and improving model performance through rejection of both random and adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

### [132] [Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402)
*Minku Kang,Hogun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUFL is a personalized subgraph federated learning framework that uses curriculum learning to prevent overfitting and improve client similarity estimation for better model aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph FL suffers from severe data heterogeneity and rapid overfitting to biased local patterns, causing client similarity estimation to collapse and aggregation to lose effectiveness.

Method: Uses curriculum learning to adaptively select edges for training (easier cross-client structures first, then harder client-specific ones), and improves weighted aggregation with fine-grained structural similarity estimation on reference graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show CUFL achieves superior performance compared to relevant baselines.

Conclusion: CUFL effectively mitigates data heterogeneity in subgraph FL by regulating personalization through curriculum learning and improving similarity estimation, preventing early overfitting and enabling effective knowledge exchange.

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Metis enables stable low-bit quantization training for LLMs by addressing anisotropic parameter distributions through spectral decomposition, adaptive learning rates, and dual-range regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anisotropic parameter distributions with dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with block-wise quantization bias, causing training instability and poor performance in low-bit LLM training.

Method: Combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to disentangle dominant from long-tail components, (ii) adaptive learning rates in spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions, and (iii) dual-range regularizer to constrain numerical precision and parameter range distribution.

Result: FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, enabling robust low-bit quantization for LLMs.

Conclusion: Metis provides an effective framework for stable and scalable low-bit quantization training of large language models, overcoming fundamental barriers posed by anisotropic parameter distributions.

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

*Rahul Meshram,Kesav Kaza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits (PORMAB) with finite states and actions, focusing on applications like public health intervention planning. It analyzes Lagrangian bounds, presents approximation methods using PBVI and rollout policies, and discusses Whittle index policies with their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by applications in recommendation systems, communication systems, public healthcare outreach, and operations research. The specific application driving this work is public-health intervention planning, where multiple actions are available for each bandit with budget constraints.

Method: The paper formulates a discounted optimization problem for PORMAB with finite states and actions. It analyzes Lagrangian bound methods, uses point-based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy for approximations, studies heuristic policies, and examines Whittle index policies.

Result: The research provides theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policies, presents various properties of value functions, and develops approximation methods for computing Lagrangian bounds in challenging POMDP settings with multiple actions.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the computational challenges of multi-action PORMAB through Lagrangian bounds and approximation techniques, while also highlighting the limitations of Whittle index policies in this extended model with multiple actions per bandit.

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt tuning's memorization capability in transformers is theoretically analyzed, showing linear scaling with prompt length and inherent memory limitations that cause performance degradation with extended contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical success of prompt tuning, theoretical understanding of its memorization capabilities and limitations in transformers remains limited, particularly regarding performance degradation with long sequences.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving two main results: 1) information memorization scales linearly with prompt length, and 2) formal proof of performance degradation in transformers with extended contexts due to inherent memory constraints.

Result: Transformers have limited memory capacity that cannot scale faster than linearly with prompt length, and they inherently suffer from performance degradation when handling long sequences regardless of context size.

Conclusion: This work provides fundamental theoretical understanding of transformer limitations, showing they have constrained memory capabilities that limit their ability to effectively process and retain information from long sequences.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general framework for studying activation sparsity in modern LLMs, revealing universal patterns and providing practical guidelines for model design and acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Input-dependent activation sparsity is well-studied in ReLU networks but approaches don't transfer to modern LLMs that use different activation functions, leading to fragmented and model-specific research.

Method: Proposed a general framework to assess sparsity robustness and conducted systematic study of activation sparsity in FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs.

Result: Revealed universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, providing insights into this phenomenon across different model architectures.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical guidelines for exploiting activation sparsity in LLM design and acceleration, addressing the current lack of consensus in the field.

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

*Aditya Kasliwal,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes memorization patterns in Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models, finding that different architectures exhibit distinct memorization behaviors and proposing interventions to reduce data leakage while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IAR models achieve state-of-the-art image generation performance but raise privacy concerns due to potential memorization of training data. The authors aim to understand where and how this memorization occurs across different IAR architectures.

Method: The researchers measure fine-grained memorization patterns across various IAR architectures, analyzing hierarchical per-resolution models versus standard autoregressive per-token prediction models. They identify where memorization concentrates in each architecture type.

Result: Memorization patterns differ significantly: hierarchical architectures show early emergence that deepens with resolution, while standard autoregressive models concentrate memorization in later processing stages. By intervening on the most memorizing components, data extraction capacity is significantly reduced with minimal impact on generated image quality.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into IAR model behavior and offer practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks through targeted interventions on memorizing components, enabling reduced data leakage while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

TL;DR: PSIRAGCN is a novel graph convolutional network that addresses limitations in traffic forecasting by modeling pattern-spatial interactions and regional heterogeneity through interactive fusion and message-passing reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial-temporal models struggle with effectively modeling spatial-temporal correlations across different perceptual perspectives and fail to consider interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial correlations. Most studies also neglect regional heterogeneity during message-passing due to spatial heterogeneity constraints.

Method: Proposes a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness GCN with: 1) Pattern-spatial interactive fusion framework with global-to-local perception, 2) Graph convolutional network with message-passing reconstruction using regional characteristics bank, 3) Regional awareness to capture heterogeneity between traffic network nodes.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets show PSIRAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN effectively addresses key limitations in traffic forecasting by enabling interactive pattern-spatial fusion and regional-aware message passing, achieving superior performance with balanced computational costs.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

TL;DR: GAT framework models biological pathways at gene level, outperforming MLP approaches with 81% MSE reduction and successfully rediscovering known gene interactions from raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens or pathways as 'bags of genes', discarding known pathway structure and gene-gene interactions that are crucial for understanding biological processes.

Method: Proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene level, encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions to boost model robustness.

Result: GATs achieve 81% reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment conditions compared to MLPs. The model correctly rediscovered all five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series mRNA data.

Conclusion: The GAT framework effectively captures biological pathway structure, generalizes better than traditional approaches, and demonstrates potential for generating novel biological hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological

*Xiangyu Zhang,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedThief is a self-centered federated learning attack that degrades global model performance while enhancing the attacker's private model through divergence-aware ensemble techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning attacks degrade both global and private models, but real attackers want competitive advantage by having better models than others, not just causing disruption.

Method: Proposes FedThief framework that uploads modified content to degrade global model while using divergence-aware ensemble techniques to integrate global updates and local knowledge to enhance private model.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively degrades global model performance while allowing attackers to obtain ensemble models that significantly outperform the global model.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel self-centered attack paradigm where attackers can simultaneously degrade global performance and enhance their own model quality, demonstrating a more realistic threat scenario in federated learning.

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

TL;DR: ASC integrates financial and textual data for credit monitoring using optimized spectral clustering, achieving 18% higher Silhouette scores and identifying actionable risk patterns like 30% lower default risk in recruitment-focused SMEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous data (numerical financial variables + textual records) present challenges for credit monitoring of SMEs, requiring methods that can effectively integrate both data types.

Method: Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC) integrates financial and textual similarities through optimized weight parameters and uses eigenvalue-silhouette optimization for eigenvector selection.

Result: ASC achieves 18% higher Silhouette score than single-type baseline, identifies that 51% of low-risk firms include 'social recruitment' in records, and shows recruitment-focused SMEs have 30% lower default risk. Robust across multiple algorithms with {Δ}Intra/Inter < 0.13.

Conclusion: ASC successfully bridges spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, enabling identification of meaningful clusters and supporting more targeted credit interventions for SMEs.

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

*Lu Han,Xiuying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMST integrates financial and textual data for SME credit evaluation, achieving 88.9% accuracy with improved interpretability over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees struggle with high-dimensional data and cannot effectively incorporate textual information, limiting their effectiveness in SME credit evaluation.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) transform textual data to numerical matrices via matrix factorization, (2) select financial features using Lasso regression, (3) build multivariate segmentation tree with Gini/Entropy and weakest-link pruning.

Result: 88.9% accuracy on 1,428 Chinese SMEs dataset, outperforming baseline decision trees (87.4%), logistic regression, and SVM with better interpretability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IMST successfully integrates textual and financial data, providing superior accuracy, interpretability, and risk detection capabilities for SME credit evaluation compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

### [143] [An Efficient GNNs-to-KANs Distillation via Self-Attention Dynamic Sampling with Potential for Consumer Electronics Edge Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00560)
*Can Cui,Zilong Fu,Penghe Huang,Yuanyuan Li,Wu Deng,Dongyan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SA-DSD framework distills knowledge from GNNs to improved Fourier KANs for edge deployment, achieving significant performance gains with reduced parameters and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices need efficient models but MLPs struggle to capture GNNs' complex dependencies. KANs offer better nonlinear fitting but need optimization for knowledge distillation.

Method: Improved Fourier KAN (FR-KAN+) with learnable frequency bases and phase-shift mechanisms, plus margin-level sampling probability matrix and adaptive weighted loss for distillation.

Result: 3.05%-3.62% improvement over GNN teachers, 15.61% over FR-KAN+, 16.96x parameter reduction, and 55.75% faster inference compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: SA-DSD effectively transfers GNN knowledge to efficient KANs, enabling high-performance edge deployment with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods are inadequate for brief neural events, and existing advanced techniques lack accessible Python implementations for quantifying transient causal interactions in neuroscience.

Method: TranCIT implements a comprehensive pipeline including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and robust Structural Causal Model-based methods (DCS and rDCS) for detecting event-driven causal effects.

Result: The toolbox successfully captures causality in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail, and identifies known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave ripple events in real data.

Conclusion: TranCIT provides a user-friendly, validated open-source solution for investigating transient causal dynamics in complex neural systems.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

TL;DR: Evaluation of fine-tuning methods for molecular graph foundation models, leading to development of ROFT-MOL method that combines weight interpolation and ensemble techniques for improved performance on both regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular graph foundation models face unique challenges including smaller pre-training datasets, severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, and need to handle diverse objectives (regression and classification), requiring robust fine-tuning methods to address overfitting and sparse labeling issues.

Method: Classified eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms (weight-based, representation-based, partial fine-tuning) and benchmarked them on downstream tasks. Developed ROFT-MOL which combines simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods.

Result: Extensive evaluation provided valuable insights that informed the design of ROFT-MOL, which delivered improved performance across both regression and classification task types while maintaining ease of use.

Conclusion: ROFT-MOL effectively addresses the unique challenges of molecular graph foundation model fine-tuning by combining the strengths of different fine-tuning approaches, offering robust performance across diverse task types with practical usability.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning framework using Temporal Fusion Transformers for accurate 24-hour ionospheric TEC forecasting with RMSE as low as 3.33 TECU, leveraging solar EUV irradiance as strongest predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ionospheric prediction is challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers, and limited forecasting capabilities during strong space weather conditions.

Method: Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) framework that accommodates heterogeneous inputs (solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, GNSS-derived TEC) with preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies.

Result: Robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU, with solar EUV irradiance identified as the strongest predictive signal.

Conclusion: The framework provides both accurate forecasting and interpretability through attention-based analysis, with full implementation released as open-source toolkit ionopy for community development.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

### [148] [Disentangling Slow and Fast Temporal Dynamics in Degradation Inference with Hierarchical Differential Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00639)
*Mengjie Zhao,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equations (H-CDE) framework to disentangle degradation from operational dynamics in sensor data, addressing limitations of residual-based methods and Neural ODEs for condition monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to infer system degradation from sensor data because operational variations dominate measurements while degradation introduces only subtle long-term changes. Residual-based methods remain entangled with operational history, and Neural ODEs face numerical stiffness and degradation disentanglement challenges.

Method: Hierarchical CDE framework with slow (degradation) and fast (operation) components, featuring multi-scale time integration, learnable path transformation for degradation drivers, and monotonic activation function for regularization.

Result: H-CDE effectively disentangles degradation from operational dynamics, outperforms residual-based baselines, and provides more accurate, robust, and interpretable inference across both dynamic response and steady state systems.

Conclusion: The proposed H-CDE framework successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of degradation inference by providing a unified architecture that handles time-scale separation and enables reliable degradation estimation from noisy sensor data.

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

*Zhipeng Yin,Zichong Wang,Avash Palikhe,Zhen Liu,Jun Liu,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMCR framework addresses copyright risks in text-to-image models through prompt restructuring, attention-based infringement detection, and adaptive mitigation during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often unintentionally replicate copyrighted content from training data, creating legal and ethical challenges that existing prompt-based mitigation strategies fail to address in subtle cases.

Method: Three-pronged approach: 1) Systematic restructuring of risky prompts into safe forms, 2) Attention-based similarity analysis for partial infringement detection, 3) Adaptive risk mitigation during generation process.

Result: Extensive experiments show AMCR effectively reveals and mitigates latent copyright risks while maintaining image quality.

Conclusion: AMCR provides a comprehensive framework for safer deployment of generative models, offering practical insights and benchmarks for copyright risk management.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

*Kushagra Chandak,Vincent Liu,Haanvid Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAEL-MIPS learns context-action embeddings from offline data to minimize MSE in off-policy evaluation for contextual bandits, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IPS estimators suffer from high variance in large action spaces, and MIPS estimators don't minimize MSE or consider context information effectively.

Method: Proposes CAEL-MIPS which learns context-action embeddings to minimize the mean squared error of the MIPS estimator, building on theoretical bias-variance analysis.

Result: Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets show CAEL-MIPS outperforms baseline estimators in terms of mean squared error.

Conclusion: Learning context-action embeddings specifically to minimize MSE leads to improved off-policy evaluation performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data is a persistent problem in tabular data analysis, and while generative models like VAEs and GANs have been explored for imputation, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have been overlooked despite their computational power.

Method: Developed an NCA-based model with appropriate adaptations specifically designed for missing data imputation tasks in tabular data.

Result: The proposed NCA-based model demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving lower imputation error and better post-imputation performance.

Conclusion: Neural Cellular Automata represent a powerful and previously unexplored approach for tabular data imputation that can effectively address missing data problems and outperform existing generative model-based solutions.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

TL;DR: Evolutionary multi-objective optimization framework for physics-informed operator learning that balances operator/physics losses, improves exploration via replica exchange dynamics, and provides Bayesian uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics-informed neural networks and operator learning methods struggle with balancing losses, robustness under noisy/sparse data, and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Integrates evolutionary multi-objective optimization for Pareto-optimal loss balancing, replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for global exploration, and Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling.

Result: Outperforms general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise robustness, and uncertainty quantification on 1D Burgers equation and time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing operator learning approaches by providing adaptive loss balancing, improved exploration, and built-in uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

Molecular dynamics confirmed binding stability. It also outperformed established kinase inhibitors like brigatinib and sorafenib, and benchmarked superior to JT-VAE and MolGPT across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: VECTOR+ provides a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design in low-data settings, effectively bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for AI-accelerated drug discovery.

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Haoyue Bai,Anjali Kaushik,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPDR framework transforms data features to maximize target prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction, using DELTA's two-phase variational disentangled learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data contains sensitive attributes subject to regulations like HIPAA/GDPR, requiring privacy-preserving feature engineering that balances utility and privacy protection.

Method: DELTA framework with Phase I: policy-guided RL for utility feature discovery; Phase II: variational LSTM seq2seq with adversarial-causal disentanglement to suppress privacy signals.

Result: Experiments on 8 datasets show ~9.3% predictive performance improvement and ~35% privacy leakage reduction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DELTA provides robust privacy-aware data transformation that effectively balances utility and privacy protection requirements for regulated data environments.

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any

*Osama Ahmad,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zubair Khalid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGN transforms iterative variational mode decomposition into a trainable neural module for efficient spatiotemporal forecasting, achieving 85-95% error reduction and 250x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decomposition-integrated approaches like VMGCN suffer from computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning despite improving accuracy through signal decomposition.

Method: Proposes mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) with: (1) unfolded VMD module replacing iterative optimization with fixed-depth network, (2) mode-specific learnable bandwidth constraints to adapt spatial heterogeneity and prevent spectral overlap.

Result: Achieves 85-95% reduction in prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on LargeST benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations). Reduces decomposition time by 250x.

Conclusion: MAGN successfully addresses computational inefficiency and manual tuning limitations of previous decomposition methods while significantly improving forecasting accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Renfei Zhang,Mohit Pandey,Artem Cherkasov,Martin Ester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALD-GFlowNet is a generative active learning framework that uses GFlowNets to sample molecules proportionally to BALD reward, enabling scalable virtual screening without evaluating entire unlabeled pools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pool-based active learning becomes computationally prohibitive when scaling to billion-sample libraries in drug discovery virtual screening, despite methods like BALD being effective for sample prioritization.

Method: Replaces traditional pool-based acquisition with generative sampling using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in proportion to BALD reward, making scalability independent of unlabeled pool size.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse molecules in virtual screening experiments.

Conclusion: BALD-GFlowNet offers a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular discovery by overcoming computational bottlenecks of traditional active learning approaches.

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

### [158] [Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation: A Replay-Free and Resource-Efficient Approach For Continual Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00735)
*Jingtao Liu,Xinming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAAM is a replay-free continual graph learning method that uses lightweight task-specific modulators to dynamically control a frozen GNN backbone, achieving state-of-the-art performance without extensive pre-training or data replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual graph learning methods struggle with the stability-plasticity dilemma (replay-based methods) or require resource-heavy pre-training (replay-free methods). The authors propose that dynamically modulating a frozen backbone with lightweight modules can overcome both challenges.

Method: Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM) uses Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs) that are trained and frozen per task. A prototype-guided strategy copies similar past modulators for initialization and selects relevant frozen NSMs for inference, enabling fine-grained node-attentive modulation of the GNN's internal flow.

Result: TAAM comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in continual graph learning.

Conclusion: The proposed TAAM approach successfully navigates the stability-plasticity dilemma without data replay or extensive pre-training, offering a resource-efficient solution for continual graph learning through dynamic modulation of frozen backbones.

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced DST-based classifier with improved membership modeling using Gaussian/GMM selection and novel possibility-to-BPA transformation, achieving 4.84% accuracy improvement over existing evidential classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DST-based classifiers suffer from oversimplified membership functions and limited exploitation of belief structures, reducing effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: 1) Selective modeling strategy using single Gaussian and GMMs for membership functions with cross-validation guidance 2) Novel transformation of possibility distribution to BPA by combining simple BPAs from normalized distributions 3) Applied to evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier

Result: Proposed classifier outperforms best existing evidential classifier with 4.84% average accuracy improvement while maintaining low variance, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier successfully addresses limitations of traditional DST approaches through improved membership modeling and richer BPA representation, providing more effective uncertainty handling in complex classification tasks.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

### [160] [Flow Matters: Directional and Expressive GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00772)
*Arman Gupta,Govind Waghmare,Gaurav Oberoi,Nitish Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two GNN architectures (Poly and Dir-Poly) that combine polynomial expressiveness with edge directionality for improved node classification in heterophilic graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results on directional graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GNNs struggle with heterophilic graphs where neighboring nodes belong to different classes. Prior work suggests edge directionality can increase effective homophily, while polynomial GNNs show promise in capturing higher-order feature interactions.

Method: Two architectures: (1) polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly) that learns permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over input features, and (2) direction-aware variant (Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both maintain scalability with no added time complexity.

Result: Poly model consistently outperforms existing baselines on five benchmark heterophilic datasets. Dir-Poly offers additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire), achieving state-of-the-art results. Artificial directionality on undirected graphs doesn't always help.

Conclusion: Edge direction and expressive feature modeling play complementary roles in heterophilic graph learning. The benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent and works best on graphs with inherent directionality.

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

### [161] [ProCause: Generating Counterfactual Outcomes to Evaluate Prescriptive Process Monitoring Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00797)
*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProCause is a new generative approach for evaluating Prescriptive Process Monitoring methods that addresses limitations of existing RealCause by supporting sequential models and multiple causal inference architectures, with ensemble models showing better reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) using RealCause overlook temporal dependencies in process data and rely on a single causal inference model architecture (TARNet), limiting effectiveness.

Method: ProCause introduces a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures including S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble approach.

Result: Research using a simulator with known ground truths revealed that TARNet is not always optimal; ensemble models offer more consistent reliability, and LSTMs show potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies exist.

Conclusion: ProCause provides a more reliable evaluation framework for PresPM methods, validated through both simulation with ground truths and real-world data analysis, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

TL;DR: Survey paper exploring fairness issues in Federated Learning, covering sources of bias, mitigation techniques, evaluation metrics, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning enables collaborative model training while preserving privacy, but suffers from fairness concerns due to various heterogeneity sources that cause biases, skewed predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient convergence.

Method: Comprehensive survey approach analyzing diverse sources of bias (data, client, model biases), reviewing state-of-the-art mitigation techniques, discussing theoretical foundations, and examining evaluation metrics for fairness measurement.

Result: Provides a thorough overview of fairness notions, technical aspects, and current techniques for addressing biases in FL systems, along with their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Identifies open research directions for achieving fairer FL frameworks and establishes a strong foundation for future research in this critical area of privacy-preserving collaborative learning.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Conclusion: The ML-based approach successfully balances accuracy and interpretability, providing a transparent and practical solution for driving style classification that can be effectively deployed in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: Accurate prediction of 3D crystal structures for organic materials remains challenging despite advances, and existing methods rely on computationally expensive iterative approaches

Method: Proposed a novel loss function with differentiable linear assignment based on Sinkhorn algorithm that captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining permutation invariance

Result: Significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated subset of Crystallography Open Database

Conclusion: Simple regression with SinkFast method achieves superior performance over computationally expensive iterative methods for molecular crystal structure prediction

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

TL;DR: Causal SHAP integrates causal relationships into SHAP feature attribution to address SHAP's limitation of confusing correlation with causality, particularly when features are highly correlated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated, which is problematic in high-stakes domains like healthcare where true causal understanding is critical.

Method: Combines Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal strength quantification to integrate causal relationships into feature attribution while preserving SHAP's desirable properties.

Result: Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for causal-aware model explanations in Explainable AI, particularly valuable in domains like healthcare where understanding true causal relationships is essential for informed decision-making.

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models

Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are

Method: Developed TalentPredictor - a semi-supervised multi-modal neural network combining Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. Used existing offline educational data from 1,041 secondary students, clustered award records into talent categories, and extracted features from diverse learning behaviors.

Result: Achieved high prediction accuracy with 0.908 classification accuracy and 0.908 ROCAUC in predicting seven talent types (academic, sport, art, leadership, service, technology, others).

Conclusion: Demonstrates machine learning's potential for early identification of diverse student talents, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and enabling timely intervention in secondary education.

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

Result: Outperformed popular baseline methods on large-scale credit lending and tabular datasets across interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity metrics.

Conclusion: The approach produces robust and realistic counterfactual explanations for tabular data, addressing a significant gap in interpretable machine learning for financial and social science applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations methods provide an important tool in the field of
{interpretable machine learning}. Recent advances in this direction have
focused on diffusion models to explain a deep classifier. However, these
techniques have predominantly focused on problems in computer vision. In this
paper, we focus on tabular data typical in finance and the social sciences and
propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an

Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular

Result: Experiments on large-scale tabular datasets show the method generates diversified and in-distribution counterfactual samples, outperforming other autoencoder-based approaches.

Conclusion: The Gaussian process-based autoencoder approach provides effective counterfactual explanations with reduced overfitting risk and improved sample quality.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTRNet is a Transformer variant that dynamically routes only ~10% of tokens through quadratic attention at each layer while maintaining full Transformer performance, significantly reducing computational costs especially for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers apply quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer, making them computationally expensive. There's a need for more efficient architectures that maintain performance while reducing computation.

Method: DTRNet preserves the MLP module but dynamically routes tokens - only ~10% go through full attention while others receive lightweight linear updates, decoupling token updates from attention mixing.

Result: DTRNet maintains performance comparable to full Transformers while consistently outperforming routing-based methods like MoD and D-LLM in accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs. Efficiency gains scale with sequence length.

Conclusion: DTRNet provides a simple, efficient, and scalable alternative to standard Transformers by substantially reducing the quadratic computation share while ensuring every token is explicitly updated.

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

*Lukas Pertl,Han Xuanyuan,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies superposition (feature sharing) in GNN latent spaces using controlled experiments, finding that width, pooling, and activations affect feature geometry and alignment with human concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting GNNs is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts, so understanding superposition in GNN latent spaces is needed.

Method: Used controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, extracting features as class-conditional centroids at graph level and linear-probe directions at node level, then analyzed geometry with basis-invariant diagnostics across GCN/GIN/GAT architectures.

Result: Found that increasing width produces phase pattern in overlap, topology imprints overlap onto node features, pooling remixes features into task-aligned axes, sharper pooling increases alignment and reduces channel sharing, and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings.

Conclusion: Results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

### [171] [SCOUT: Toward Sub-Quadratic Attention via Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00935)
*Aref Jafari,Yuhe Fan,Benyamin Jamialahmadi,Parsa Farinneya,Boxing Chen,Marzieh S. Tahaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOUT is a hybrid architecture that compresses tokens locally within segments and applies attention only over compressed representations, achieving near full-attention performance with sub-quadratic complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic attention complexity limiting scalability to long sequences, while linear models like Mamba and SWA risk performance degradation on long sequences due to inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens.

Method: Each token embedding is enriched via linear local mixer (Mamba or SWA), then sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens that summarize input history, rather than all previous tokens.

Result: SCOUT outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under same computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling and common-sense reasoning at 400M and 1.3B scales, with higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models.

Conclusion: SCOUT retains much expressivity of full attention while substantially reducing computational and memory costs, achieving sub-quadratic growth rate that is far more scalable than full Transformers.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

### [172] [ART: Adaptive Resampling-based Training for Imbalanced Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00955)
*Arjun Basandrai,Shourya Jain,K. Ilanthenral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ART is an adaptive resampling method that dynamically adjusts class distributions during training based on class-wise F1 scores, outperforming traditional static resampling methods on imbalanced classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional resampling methods use fixed distributions that ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, limiting model performance. Static strategies don't adapt to which classes are currently underperforming during training.

Method: Periodically updates training data distribution based on class-wise macro F1 scores computed at fixed intervals. Adapts at class level rather than instance level to avoid noise and outlier sensitivity. Shifts attention incrementally towards underperforming classes.

Result: Consistently outperforms SMOTE, NearMiss, and cost-sensitive learning on binary and multi-class tasks. Improves macro F1 by average 2.64 percentage points on tabular datasets. Statistically significant gains (p < 0.05) on tabular data with favorable results on text and image tasks.

Conclusion: ART delivers the strongest and most consistent macro F1 performance across diverse tasks, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification that adapts better to class-wise learning difficulties than existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm that provides model personalization and Byzantine resilience even when Byzantine clients dominate honest clients, using cyber-physical properties for trust assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of model personalization in federated learning with high data heterogeneity, extend multi-task learning to online decentralized settings, and achieve Byzantine resilience when Byzantine clients outnumber honest ones - a common real-world scenario.

Method: Develops an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm that leverages cyber-physical properties (like received signal strength or side information) to assign trust probabilities to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed algorithm performs close to a Byzantine-free setting, demonstrating effective resilience against dominating Byzantine clients.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines multi-task learning with cyber-physical trust mechanisms to achieve personalized models and Byzantine resilience in online decentralized federated learning environments, even when malicious clients outnumber honest ones.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

TL;DR: MEPT is a novel Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning framework that adaptively activates neural pathways to handle diverse data distributions, outperforming SOTA methods on SuperGLUE with 1.94% accuracy improvement and 79.25% prompt reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning approaches have rigid parameter spaces that limit their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways for adapting to diverse and evolving data distributions.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT) that integrates multiple prompt experts within a Mixture of Experts architecture to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE with 1.94% mean accuracy improvement and significantly reduces activated prompts by 79.25%. Effectiveness validated through theoretical insights and neural activation pathway visualization.

Conclusion: MEPT provides an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework that enables adaptive learning of diverse data distributions through dynamic neural pathway activation, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexMDMs extend masked diffusion models to support flexible-length sequence generation while maintaining any-order inference capabilities, achieving better performance on length modeling and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models are limited to fixed-length generations and cannot support token insertions, which restricts their applicability to variable-length sequence tasks.

Method: FlexMDMs extend the stochastic interpolant framework to generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them, enabling modeling of flexible-length sequences while retaining any-order inference properties.

Result: FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while significantly improving length modeling fidelity, achieve 60% higher success rate on maze planning, and enable easy retrofitting of pretrained models (e.g., LLaDA-8B fine-tuned in 3 days with improved math and code performance).

Conclusion: FlexMDMs successfully overcome the fixed-length limitation of traditional masked diffusion models while preserving their parallel inference advantages, demonstrating superior performance on various sequence generation tasks.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-user variability in human activity recognition (HAR) hampers generalization in real-world settings, as conventional methods overfit to user-specific patterns and existing domain generalization approaches often overlook temporal dependencies or require impractical domain labels.

Method: Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG) redefines feature extraction as sequential decision-making using RL. It employs a Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens capturing user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance.

Result: Evaluations on DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show TPRL-DG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior accuracy without per-user calibration.

Conclusion: TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems by learning robust, user-invariant temporal patterns, facilitating advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and context-aware environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior

TL;DR: MatPROV introduces a graph-based approach using PROV-DM standard to extract and represent materials synthesis procedures from scientific literature, capturing complex structural relationships beyond linear sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for extracting synthesis procedures rely on rigid schemas or assume linear sequences, limiting their ability to capture the structural complexity of real-world materials synthesis procedures.

Method: Adopted PROV-DM international standard for provenance information to create flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. Used large language models to extract PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures from scientific literature, creating the MatPROV dataset with directed graphs representing materials, operations, and conditions.

Result: Created MatPROV dataset that captures structural complexities and causal relationships through visually intuitive directed graphs, enabling machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge.

Conclusion: The graph-based PROV-DM approach successfully addresses limitations of previous methods, providing a foundation for automated synthesis planning and optimization in materials research.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

TL;DR: Proposes a fine-tuned large brain model that uses IMU data to identify and remove motion artifacts from EEG signals, outperforming traditional single-modality methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals have low signal-to-noise ratios due to motion artifacts, which hinders real-world BCI deployment. Most existing methods don't leverage simultaneous IMU recordings that directly capture motion dynamics.

Method: Fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM) with correlation attention mapping that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG. Uses 9.2M parameters trained on 5.9 hours of EEG-IMU data.

Result: Significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios compared to ASR-ICA benchmark. Achieved with only 0.2346% of the base model's training data (2500 hours).

Conclusion: Incorporating IMU reference signals through correlation attention mapping effectively addresses motion artifact removal in EEG, enabling more robust real-world BCI applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models often produce probabilistic programs with syntactic and semantic errors. The framework is motivated by probabilistic programmers' domain expertise and debugging strategies to ensure valid distributions and well-formed parameters.

Method: RefineStat enforces semantic constraints to ensure synthesized programs contain valid distributions and parameters, then applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood components when reliability checks fail.

Result: Evaluation shows RefineStat produces programs that are both syntactically sound and statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source large language models like OpenAI o3.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of generating reliable probabilistic programs from small language models by incorporating domain-specific constraints and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

Result: CCE demonstrates strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity O(n). The paper also establishes RankEval, the first standardized benchmark for comparing metric ranking capabilities.

Conclusion: CCE provides a superior evaluation metric for time series anomaly detection with improved properties, and RankEval enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics, with both implementations being fully open-source.

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,

introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for

experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first

<details>

Motivation: Current goal-oriented semantic communication approaches suffer from joint training requirements, redundant data exchange, and reliance on labeled datasets, limiting their task-agnostic utility.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning with covariance-based contrastive learning to extract invariant representations from source data that are compressed yet retain essential information for downstream tasks, focusing on machine-to-machine image transmission.

Result: Outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10% and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions across multiple image datasets.

Conclusion: The SC-GIR framework effectively learns compact and informative latent representations that enable efficient goal-oriented semantic communication without task-specific training requirements.

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

TL;DR: MATL-DC is a multi-domain aggregation transfer learning framework for EEG emotion recognition that works with completely unseen target domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG emotion recognition models heavily depend on both source and target domain data, which limits practical applications. The authors aim to develop a framework that can handle completely unseen target domains during training.

Method: Proposes MATL-DC framework with feature decoupling module to separate domain and class features, multi-domain aggregation to form superdomains, class prototype extraction, and pairwise learning strategy to handle label noise. Target domain is completely unseen during training.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 84.70% on SEED, 68.11% on SEED-IV, and 61.08% on SEED-V datasets, outperforming methods that use both source and target domain data.

Conclusion: MATL-DC demonstrates effective EEG emotion recognition with unseen target domains, showing superior performance and practical applicability for real-world affective BCI systems.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel nonlinear performative prediction framework using kernel methods and maximum margin approach that relaxes restrictive assumptions and guarantees performative stability for both linear and nonlinear cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current performative prediction methods rely on unrealistic linear assumptions and bounded gradient constraints that don't hold in real-world applications with complex nonlinear data distributions.

Method: Formulate performative loss using maximum margin approach, extend to nonlinear spaces via kernel methods, use prediction error discrepancy to quantify distribution shifts, and derive performative stability conditions for both linear and nonlinear cases.

Result: Developed algorithm guarantees performative stability, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for both linear and nonlinear distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generalizes performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving theoretical guarantees, addressing limitations of existing methods and demonstrating practical effectiveness across diverse data distributions.

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Yassine Abbahaddou,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros,Johannes F. Lutzeyer,Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADMP-GNN is a novel GNN framework that dynamically adjusts message-passing layers per node instead of using fixed layers, improving performance on node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GNNs use fixed message-passing steps for all nodes, but empirical analysis shows optimal layer count varies by node characteristics, indicating a need for adaptive depth.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN) framework that dynamically determines the number of message-passing layers for each individual node based on their characteristics.

Result: ADMP-GNN demonstrates improved performance over baseline GNN models on node classification tasks, with experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets supporting the approach.

Conclusion: Adaptive depth message passing that customizes layer count per node provides better performance than fixed-depth approaches, and this framework can be applied to any message-passing GNN model.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While xLSTM networks show promise in modeling temporal dependencies, there's room for improvement in representational capacity and forecasting performance, especially for real-world datasets with complex hierarchical dynamics.

Method: Proposes StoxLSTM by integrating stochastic latent variables within xLSTM architecture, creating a state space modeling framework with specially designed recurrent blocks to model latent dynamic evolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show StoxLSTM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and stronger generalization ability.

Conclusion: StoxLSTM successfully improves upon xLSTM by incorporating stochastic modeling, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex temporal patterns and dependencies across diverse time series applications.

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and
stronger generalization ability.

*Eddi Weinwurm,Alexander Kovalenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL) to maintain vector space properties like orthogonality and linear independence during dimensionality reduction by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices of high-dimensional data and their embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction techniques often distort critical vector space properties (orthogonality, linear independence) that are essential for tasks like cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification.

Method: Develops RPL loss function that preserves relationships by minimizing differences between relationship matrices (Gram or cosine) of original high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings. Uses neural networks for non-linear projections with error bounds from matrix perturbation theory.

Result: Initial experiments show RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely maintaining performance on downstream tasks, likely due to preservation of key vector space properties.

Conclusion: RPL effectively preserves geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction and has broad applicability beyond dimensionality reduction to cross-domain alignment, transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness, graph learning, and federated learning where geometric consistency is crucial.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

TL;DR: A geometry-aware deep learning framework using layer-wise local training to improve adversarial robustness while maintaining training accuracy, explained through an energy model with Hebbian coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing training accuracy and adversarial robustness in deep learning by developing a framework that promotes better feature space organization.

Method: Layer-wise local training approach that sculpts internal representations to achieve intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, leading to manifold smoothness.

Result: Improved adversarial robustness against both white and black box attacks while maintaining training performance, with reduced representation interference.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into the physics of learning and represents progress toward aligning biological and artificial intelligence systems through better knowledge assimilation.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

*Niklas Kemper,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that current focus on GNN expressivity theory is misguided and proposes Message Passing Complexity (MPC) as a better continuous measure that captures practical limitations and better correlates with empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current expressivity theory for GNNs focuses too much on binary characterizations and idealized assumptions that don't reflect practical capabilities. Most real-world tasks don't require expressivity beyond basic WL test, and the theory fails to account for practical limitations like over-squashing.

Method: Proposes Message Passing Complexity (MPC) - a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty for a GNN architecture to solve tasks through message passing. MPC captures practical limitations while preserving theoretical impossibility results.

Result: Extensive validation shows MPC's theoretical predictions correlate with empirical performance on fundamental GNN tasks, successfully explaining architectural successes and failures.

Conclusion: MPC provides a more powerful and nuanced framework than expressivity theory for understanding and improving GNN architectures, effectively narrowing the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

*Andrea Fox,Francesco De Pellegrini,Eitan Altman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized MARL framework using constrained MDPs with shared constraint vectors for edge computing resource coordination, enabling local decision-making with minimal communication while meeting global resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing systems require autonomous agents to make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources, but existing MARL methods rely on centralized critics or frequent communication which fail under limited observability and communication constraints.

Method: Each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with coordination through a shared constraint vector that prevents overloading shared server resources. Constraints are updated infrequently and serve as lightweight coordination mechanism using safe reinforcement learning.

Result: The approach shows improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings, with theoretical guarantees established under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized framework enables effective coordination with minimal communication, allowing agents to align with global resource usage objectives while making fast local decisions in edge computing environments.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

TL;DR: Iterative example selection strategy improves LLM generalization for compositional reasoning tasks like algebraic expressions with non-standard rules


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with systematic generalization, especially for compositional reasoning tasks and out-of-distribution examples requiring non-standard rules

Method: In-context learning with iterative example selection strategy that incrementally constructs tailored few-shot examples optimized for specific tasks

Result: LLMs show limited proficiency in mathematical tasks with non-standard rules but benefit from iterative shot selection with explicit reasoning instructions. Some LLMs perform better with simpler examples rather than complex ones matching test distribution

Conclusion: The proposed iterative example selection methodology effectively enhances LLM generalization capabilities for compositional reasoning tasks, with simpler examples sometimes outperforming complex distribution-matching examples

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

TL;DR: Proposes using RL-trained policies to efficiently sample deterministic simulation environments for surrogate modeling, outperforming traditional methods like Latin-Hypercube sampling and Active Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sampling strategies are ineffective for wide state spaces in computationally expensive simulations, limiting surrogate modeling efficiency.

Method: Uses policies trained by Reinforcement Learning to sample environments, combining random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore maximum entropy regions of state transition distribution.

Result: Mixed dataset with samples from random, expert, and maximum entropy exploration agents provides best performance across all datasets, enabling meaningful state space representation.

Conclusion: The method improves state-of-the-art sampling and enables surrogate-aided RL policy optimization on complex simulators.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-UNO: equivariant U-shaped neural operator that accurately predicts phase separation dynamics from short histories, outperforming standard neural operators by incorporating physical symmetries and multiscale architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers for Cahn-Hilliard equation are computationally expensive and lack flexibility. Current neural operators fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect physical symmetries in phase separation problems.

Method: Developed an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) that combines global spectral convolution with multi-resolution architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with underlying physics.

Result: E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. Achieves accurate predictions across space and time with better generalization and less training data.

Conclusion: E-UNO establishes an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems by encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, yielding physically consistent dynamics with improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

*Li Rong Wang,Thomas C. Henderson,Yew Soon Ong,Yih Yng Ng,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two methods for deriving prediction intervals from Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE) to improve uncertainty quantification in vital sign forecasting, with Gaussian copula method best for low-frequency data and KNN approach best for high-frequency data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for vital sign forecasting lack reliable uncertainty quantification, making it difficult for clinicians to trust model outputs and distinguish meaningful warnings from model noise, which hinders clinical decision-making.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Parametric Gaussian copula method assuming prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow Gaussian copula distribution for closed-form PI computation, and 2) Non-parametric KNN approach that empirically estimates conditional error distribution using similar validation instances.

Result: Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction baselines on low-frequency data, while KNN approach performs best on high-frequency data across two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling.

Conclusion: RUE-derived prediction intervals show clinical promise for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign forecasts, addressing the trust and interpretability challenges in deploying deep learning models in healthcare.

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

TL;DR: DEPO is a data-efficient policy optimization pipeline that combines optimized offline and online data selection strategies to reduce training costs while improving reasoning performance in large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods require extensive rollout computation and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. There's a need for more efficient training approaches.

Method: Combines offline curation (selecting high-quality samples based on diversity, influence, and difficulty) with online RLVR training using sample-level explorability metric to filter low-potential samples, plus replay mechanism for under-explored samples.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across 5 reasoning benchmarks. Achieves 1.85x speed-up on AIME24 and 1.66x speed-up on AIME25 using only 20% of training data compared to GRPO with full dataset.

Conclusion: DEPO provides an effective solution for data-efficient reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Conclusion: FMAE provides a practical route to flexible, data-efficient models that simplify real-world multi-task management of dynamical systems like batteries, reducing engineering effort while maintaining high performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering

TL;DR: Novel optimization framework using resurgence theory to extract global landscape information from divergent series via Borel transform singularities, enabling principled guidance for local optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local gradient methods lack global information about objective function landscapes, leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to initialization.

Method: Compute statistical mechanical partition function Z(g) for small coupling, extract asymptotic series coefficients, identify Borel plane singularities that correspond to critical objective values.

Result: Borel transform singularities provide one-to-one mapping to critical objective function values, offering global guidance for local optimizers.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretically grounded target values for optimization, enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal regions unlike heuristic methods.

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

*Jaeho Choi,Hyeri Kim,Kwang-Ho Kim,Jaesung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a differentiable Advanced Torrential (AT) loss function to address limitations of CSI-based optimization for precipitation forecasting during dry periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches for precipitation forecasting rely on off-the-shelf loss functions or CSI optimization, which become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below threshold levels.

Method: Introduces a simple penalty expression reinterpreted as a QUBO formulation, which is then relaxed into a differentiable AT loss function through approximation.

Result: The AT loss demonstrates superiority through Lipschitz constant analysis, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with operational models.

Conclusion: The proposed AT loss function effectively addresses the limitations of CSI-based optimization for precipitation forecasting, particularly during dry periods, showing improved performance and consistency.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

### [201] [Causal Sensitivity Identification using Generative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01352)
*Soma Bandyopadhyay,Sudeshna Sarkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a generative causal impact analysis method using CVAE to identify causally sensitive features and improve prediction tasks by reducing confounding bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that can identify causal relationships in data and use this understanding to improve predictive performance, particularly in spatiotemporal trajectory prediction tasks.

Method: Uses Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to perform causal impact analysis through interventional and counterfactual perspectives. Identifies causally sensitive features and evaluates how changes in causes affect outcomes.

Result: Method successfully identifies causal impact and improves predictive performance. Validated on large-scale GeoLife dataset and benchmark Asia Bayesian network, demonstrating effectiveness in location recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generative causal impact analysis method effectively reduces confounding bias and enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging causal relationships among features.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

### [202] [DPF-CM: A Data Processing Framework with Privacy-Preserving Vector Databases for Chinese Medical LLMs Training and Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01354)
*Wei Huang,Anda Cheng,Zhao Zhang,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPF-CM is a comprehensive data processing framework for Chinese medical LLMs that addresses both training data optimization and privacy preservation during deployment, achieving state-of-the-art performance and 27% reduction in privacy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical LLMs focus mainly on training methodologies but lack comprehensive exploration of data processing, creating a gap in both performance optimization and privacy protection.

Method: Two core modules: (1) Training data pipeline with chained examples context-learning for instruction generation and ensemble-based filtering for preference data curation; (2) Privacy preservation using Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) with four stages: model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database construction, and match-and-replace.

Result: Significantly improves model accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source Chinese medical LLMs, and reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Conclusion: DPF-CM provides a holistic framework that effectively addresses both performance optimization through improved data processing and privacy protection during deployment for Chinese medical language models.

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

*Jiarui Cao,Zhiyang Zhang,Heming Wang,Jun Xu,Ling Lan,Ran Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CbLDM: A conditional latent diffusion model for nanostructure recovery from PDF data, using Laplacian matrix and improved sampling efficiency to achieve higher accuracy than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the nanostructure inverse problem by understanding the relationship between material properties and nanostructure, treating it as a conditional generation problem using PDF data.

Method: Proposes Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model (CbLDM) that uses conditional prior to estimate posterior distribution, reduces sampling steps, and employs Laplacian matrix instead of distance matrix to minimize reconstruction error.

Result: CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy compared to existing models for nanostructure inverse problem.

Conclusion: The model effectively solves nanostructure inverse problems and shows potential for other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

*Joël Mathys,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel hierarchical graph approach using adaptive random walks with learnable transition probabilities to overcome long-range dependency limitations in message-passing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Message-passing architectures struggle to model long-range dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks, requiring a solution that can efficiently capture distant relationships in large graphs.

Method: Proposes hierarchical graph structures with adaptive random walks featuring learnable transition probabilities that decide whether to traverse the original graph or use hierarchical shortcuts.

Result: On synthetic long-range tasks, the approach exceeds theoretical bounds of traditional methods - walks preferring hierarchy achieve same performance as longer walks on original graph.

Conclusion: The method opens a promising direction for efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range dependencies through hierarchical shortcuts and adaptive walks.

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

*Armin Hadžić,Milan Papez,Tomáš Pevný*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable probabilistic circuit by selecting high-probability latent variables, enabling efficient probabilistic inference while maintaining expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models with discrete latent spaces like VQ-VAE have excellent generation capabilities but are considered intractable for probabilistic inference due to their large latent space size.

Method: Distill VQ-VAE by selecting a subset of latent variables with high probabilities, framing the distilled model as a probabilistic circuit.

Result: The distilled model preserves VQ-VAE expressiveness while providing tractable probabilistic inference, showing competitive performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: This approach challenges the view of VQ-VAE as inherently intractable, demonstrating that efficient probabilistic inference is achievable through selective latent variable distillation.

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

### [206] [Evaluating the stability of model explanations in instance-dependent cost-sensitive credit scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01409)
*Matteo Ballegeer,Matthias Bogaert,Dries F. Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency in credit scoring but produce less stable model explanations (SHAP/LIME) compared to traditional models, especially with class imbalance, creating a trade-off between cost optimization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored impact of instance-dependent cost-sensitive classifiers on the stability of model explanations, particularly given increasing regulatory demands for transparency in credit scoring.

Method: Evaluated LIME and SHAP explanation stability on IDCS models using four credit scoring datasets, assessing discriminatory power and cost-efficiency with a novel metric, and investigating feature importance stability under varying class imbalance through controlled resampling.

Result: IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency but produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models, with stability decreasing as class imbalance increases.

Conclusion: There is a critical trade-off between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring, highlighting the need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure their cost advantages are not undermined by unreliable explanations.

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

### [207] [Accelerating PDE Solvers with Equation-Recast Neural Operator Preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01416)
*Qiyun Cheng,Md Hossain Sahadath,Huihua Yang,Shaowu Pan,Wei Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MD-PNOP framework accelerates parametric PDE solvers by using neural operators as preconditioners, enabling extrapolation from single-parameter training while preserving physical constraints and achieving ~50% computational time reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers for PDEs have high computational overhead that limits large-scale parametric studies and design optimization. Neural operators face extrapolation limitations and may sacrifice physical constraints in purely data-driven approaches.

Method: Recasts residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, uses any trained neural operator to refine solutions offline. Embeds neural operator predictions as improved initial guesses in iterative PDE solvers. Architecture-agnostic framework demonstrated with DeepONet and FNO for Boltzmann transport equations.

Result: Neural operators trained on single constant parameters successfully accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous parameter distributions. Achieves ~50% reduction in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for various problem types.

Conclusion: MD-PNOP establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers that overcomes neural operator extrapolation limitations, preserves physical constraints, and provides significant computational savings without accuracy loss.

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

TL;DR: A unified geometric framework that combines reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation as instances of a single optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach that integrates separate RL objectives (reward maximization, safe exploration, intrinsic motivation) into a single geometric framework rather than treating them as distinct problems.

Method: Develops a geometric framework viewing RL goals as optimization problems on the space of achievable long-term behavior. Generalizes classical methods like policy mirror descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms to handle nonlinear utilities and convex constraints.

Result: The framework successfully captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity objectives within a single unified perspective, showing how classical RL methods can be extended to handle these varied goals.

Conclusion: Provides a geometric unification of diverse RL objectives and identifies open challenges at the intersection of geometry and deep reinforcement learning, suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation are often
studied as separate objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a
unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror
descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

### [210] [Hierarchical Motion Captioning Utilizing External Text Data Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01471)
*Clayton Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel two-step hierarchical approach enhances motion captioning by using LLMs to create detailed descriptions and retrieval-based mechanism to align low-level captions with high-level ones from external sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion captioning methods require high-level annotated motion data which is scarce in current datasets, and lack low-level motion descriptions.

Method: 1) Use large language models to generate detailed low-level descriptions from high-level captions in existing datasets. 2) Introduce retrieval-based mechanism to align detailed captions with candidate high-level captions from external text sources combined with motion features.

Result: Achieves 6% to 50% improvement in average performance (BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, ROUGE-L) compared to state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable on three datasets (HumanML3D, KIT, BOTH57M).

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages external text knowledge to significantly improve motion captioning accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAFlow is a novel target-aware molecular generation model that uses flow matching with prior interaction guidance and learnable atom number prediction to generate 3D molecules with high binding affinity to target proteins, addressing issues of unstable probability dynamics and molecule-pocket size mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structure-based drug design models suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated molecule size and protein pocket geometry, leading to inconsistent quality and off-target effects in drug discovery.

Method: PAFlow adopts flow matching framework with conditional flow matching for discrete atom types, incorporates protein-ligand interaction predictor for affinity guidance, and uses atom number predictor based on protein pocket information to align molecule size with target geometry.

Result: On CrossDocked2020 benchmark, PAFlow achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina Score) while maintaining favorable molecular properties.

Conclusion: PAFlow demonstrates superior performance in generating target-specific 3D molecules with high binding affinity and proper size alignment, advancing structure-based drug design capabilities.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

*Zhangyue Shi,Zekai Wang,Yuxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework for ECG anomaly detection that addresses class imbalance and storage limitations by using GANs for novel pattern detection and pseudo-data generation instead of storing historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address class imbalance issues in ECG signal analysis due to limited samples of certain types, and overcome storage limitations from growing patient data volumes while improving anomaly detection performance.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Unsupervised GAN-based identification for novel pattern detection, 2) Pseudo replay-based learning strategy where a generator learns data distributions for each task and synthesizes pseudo data for previous classes when new tasks arise.

Result: Validated on four public ECG datasets, showing promising performance in identifying novel anomalies while maintaining good detection accuracy for existing ECG signals.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses storage limitations and class imbalance in ECG analysis, enabling continuous learning and improved anomaly detection without requiring extensive historical data storage.

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

*Mingzhi Dai,Weiwei Cai,Xiang Feng,Huiqun Yu,Weibin Guo,Miao Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning framework using DE-BP neural networks for predicting microbial composition in wastewater treatment plants, introduces DPNG-EPMC clustering for WWTP analysis, and employs SiTime-GAN for synthetic data generation to understand activated sludge communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microbiome engineering faces significant challenges in controlling microbial communities for desired improvements in engineered ecosystems like wastewater treatment systems, requiring better predictive and analytical tools.

Method: Used backpropagation neural network optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP) for microbial composition prediction, developed novel DPNG-EPMC clustering algorithm for WWTP analysis, and employed Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN) for synthetic data generation.

Result: DE-BP model provided superior predictions of microbial composition, DPNG-EPMC effectively analyzed WWTPs under various feature attributes, and SiTime-GAN generated valuable incremental synthetic data for understanding activated sludge communities.

Conclusion: The developed machine learning framework successfully predicts microbial composition, analyzes wastewater treatment plants, and generates synthetic data, contributing to better understanding of factors influencing activated sludge communities in microbiome engineering.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoRo is a forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method that uses prompt tuning with CMA-ES optimization and knowledge encoding via random projection to prevent catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained models without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational intensity and inefficiency of gradient-based methods in continual learning, especially for resource-constrained environments, by eliminating backpropagation while maintaining performance.

Method: Lightweight prompt tuning with CMA-ES optimization for task representation, combined with knowledge encoding matrix using nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares for incremental classifier updates without revisiting prior data.

Result: Significantly reduces average forgetting, improves accuracy, reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining high knowledge retention across long task sequences.

Conclusion: FoRo provides an efficient and effective gradient-free approach for continual learning with pre-trained models, suitable for real-world multimedia applications requiring both efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both

### [215] [Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541)
*Smayan Khanna,Doruk Efe Gökmen,Risi Kondor,Vincenzo Vitelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCL's performance advantage over untrained baselines depends on dataset size and task complexity, with untrained models often matching or exceeding GCL on standard datasets, while GCL only pulls ahead on larger molecular datasets beyond a few thousand graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate whether Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) actually provides meaningful performance improvements compared to simple untrained baselines, given the strong reported performance and growing applications of GCL.

Method: Comparative analysis of GCL against untrained Graph Neural Networks, simple multilayer perceptrons, and handcrafted statistics across various dataset sizes and task complexities, including standard datasets, large molecular datasets (ogbg-molhiv), and synthetic datasets.

Result: GCL's advantage is dataset-size dependent: untrained models rival or exceed GCL on standard datasets; on ogbg-molhiv, GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs (though gains plateau); on synthetic data, GCL accuracy scales logarithmically with graph count and performance gap varies with task complexity.

Conclusion: Dataset size plays a crucial role in GCL performance evaluation, and future work should focus on accounting for dataset size in benchmarks and developing GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

### [216] [One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning Under Clustering-Agnostic Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01587)
*Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak,Roberto Pellungrini,Salvatore Rinzivillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL) is a clustering-agnostic algorithm that automatically detects the optimal moment for client clustering in federated learning, using cosine distance between gradients and temperature measures to enable efficient personalization without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses client clustering for personalized models, but existing approaches have different assumptions from standard FL and lack automated clustering timing detection.

Method: OCFL uses cosine distance between client gradients and a temperature measure to detect when the federated model converges, enabling automatic clustering timing. Tested with various one-shot clustering algorithms on 40+ tasks across 5 benchmark datasets.

Result: The approach demonstrates good performance for automated CFL without hyperparameter adjustment. Density-based clustering methods prove highly efficient for differentiating neural network loss surfaces from different distributions. GradCAM local explanations provide insights into personalization-explainability relationships.

Conclusion: OCFL provides an effective automated solution for clustered federated learning, with evidence supporting gradient-based clustering efficiency and new insights into the connection between model personalization and local prediction explainability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

### [217] [Feynman-Kac-Flow: Inference Steering of Conditional Flow Matching to an Energy-Tilted Posterior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01543)
*Konstantin Mark,Leonard Galustian,Maximilian P. -P. Kovar,Esther Heid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feynman-Kac steering for Conditional Flow Matching enables precise control over generated samples by tilting distributions with energy potentials, solving challenging tasks like generating transition states with correct chirality in chemical reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While steering approaches exist for diffusion models, they haven't been extended to flow matching methods. There's a need to steer generated samples towards precise requirements in applications like chemical reaction modeling.

Method: Formulate steering as tilting the output with an energy potential and derive Feynman-Kac steering specifically for Conditional Flow Matching (CFM).

Result: Successfully evaluated on synthetic tasks including high-dimensional tilted distributions and demonstrated impact on generating transition states of chemical reactions with correct chirality - a previously unsolved challenge.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac steering for CFM provides an effective approach for precise sample control, particularly valuable for complex applications like chemical reaction modeling where geometric constraints matter.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable
open-source at https://github.com/heid-lab/fkflow.

### [218] [Entropy-Driven Curriculum for Multi-Task Training in Human Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01613)
*Tianye Fang,Xuanshu Luo,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified training framework combining entropy-driven curriculum learning and multi-task learning for human mobility prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human mobility data complexity impedes model training, and exclusively predicting next locations neglects important movement determinants like distances and directions, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Entropy-driven curriculum learning quantifies trajectory predictability using Lempel-Ziv compression to organize training from simple to complex. Multi-task learning simultaneously optimizes location prediction with auxiliary distance and direction estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with up to 2.92x faster convergence speed compared to training without curriculum learning.

Conclusion: The integrated framework effectively addresses training inefficiencies and improves prediction accuracy by leveraging curriculum learning and multi-task supervision for comprehensive mobility pattern learning.

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

*Zihao Wang,Enneng Yang,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MergeLock is a protection mechanism that disrupts model parameters to prevent unauthorized merging of finetuned models while maintaining original functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about unauthorized model merging infringing on developers' rights and risking sensitive information leakage, as existing detection methods fail to prevent illegal merging.

Method: Leverages Transformer attention mechanism symmetry by applying randomly sampled invertible matrices to Query-Key and Value-Output branches, keeping output unchanged but pushing model out of shared parameter space.

Result: Degrades merged model performance by over 95% when protected model is involved, across both vision and language tasks. Protected models cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods.

Conclusion: MergeLock provides effective and robust protection against unauthorized model merging while preserving the original model's functionality.

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is

### [220] [Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01684)
*Sherry Yang,Joy He-Yueya,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-trained smaller models outperform static larger models in ML engineering tasks by addressing variable-duration actions and sparse rewards through duration-aware gradient updates and environment instrumentation for partial credit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML engineering agents rely on static prompting of large language models and don't improve with experience. The paper aims to show that weaker models trained with RL can outperform larger static models.

Method: Proposes duration-aware gradient updates to handle variable-duration actions and environment instrumentation using a separate LM to insert print statements for extracting partial credit as reward signals.

Result: On MLEBench, RL-trained Qwen2.5-3B model outperforms prompted Claude-3.5-Sonnet by 22% average across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Conclusion: RL-based agents with proper handling of variable-duration actions and partial credit rewards can achieve better performance than static larger models, demonstrating the value of learning from experience.

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

### [221] [Direct Profit Estimation Using Uplift Modeling under Clustered Network Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01558)
*Bram van den Akker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a practical methodology using AddIPW estimator to address interference in uplift modeling for recommender systems, enabling gradient-based optimization of economic outcomes like incremental profit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uplift modeling methods fail to account for interference effects where treating one item affects others, violating SUTVA and leading to suboptimal policies in real-world marketplaces.

Method: Uses Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) estimator as a differentiable learning objective for gradient-based optimization, integrated with response transformation techniques to optimize for economic outcomes.

Result: Simulations show the approach significantly outperforms interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow, and profit-centric strategies yield superior performance in identifying high-impact interventions.

Conclusion: Provides a practical path toward more profitable incentive personalization by bridging the gap between interference-aware estimators and uplift modeling optimization.

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

*Aryan Amit Barsainyan,Jing Yu Lim,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces STORI benchmark for evaluating RL methods under diverse stochastic conditions and proposes a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL benchmarks lack robustness testing for real-world stochastic and partially observable conditions, limiting systematic evaluation of model-based RL approaches.

Method: Developed STORI benchmark incorporating diverse stochastic effects and created a taxonomy to categorize different types of uncertainty in RL environments.

Result: Provides a standardized framework for rigorous assessment of RL methods under various forms of uncertainty and stochasticity.

Conclusion: STORI benchmark and proposed taxonomy address critical gaps in RL evaluation, enabling more systematic testing of robustness in stochastic and partially observable environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

TL;DR: Ema2Vec time embedding method improves stress prediction from irregular EMA data by capturing time dependencies, outperforming standard fixed-window approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile/wearable sensing enables continuous affect monitoring but faces challenges with missing data and irregular self-report timing in EMA studies, making human state prediction difficult.

Method: Introduces Ema2Vec, a novel time embedding method designed to handle irregularly spaced Ecological Momentary Assessments and capture time dependencies in longitudinal sequences.

Result: Ema2Vec outperforms standard stress prediction baselines using fixed-size daily windows and models without time-aware representations on longitudinal stress prediction task.

Conclusion: Time embeddings are crucial for effectively modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data, with Ema2Vec demonstrating significant improvements in stress prediction accuracy.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19 disrupted CVD care, affecting key biomarkers. Need accurate multi-target prediction from EHRs capturing interdependencies, temporal patterns, and uncertainty for better disease progression prediction.

Method: Multi-target Bayesian Transformer (MBT-CB) with BERT-based framework, Bayesian Variational Inference for uncertainty, embeddings for temporal relationships, and DeepMTR for biomarker inter-relationships.

Result: Outperformed baselines with MAE 0.00887, RMSE 0.0135, MSE 0.00027 on 3,390 CVD patient records. Effectively captured uncertainty, inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: MBT-CB shows superior performance for CVD biomarker prediction, supporting clinical decision-making during pandemics through improved uncertainty-aware modeling.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Motivation: There is growing interest in applying LLMs to time series analysis, but their ability for complex reasoning over temporal data remains underexplored, necessitating a rigorous benchmark for evaluation.

Method: Developed a dynamic and extensible benchmark by surveying 20+ academic publications to identify 33 real-world task formulations, with task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics.

Result: Evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art LLMs revealed limitations in their ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, highlighting the need for specialized domain adaptation methodologies.

Conclusion: The TSAIA Benchmark provides a comprehensive framework for assessing LLMs in time series analysis, demonstrating current model limitations and the importance of domain-specific approaches for temporal data reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning approach for vessel routing that learns optimal routes across multiple origin-destination pairs using AIS data and wind fields, with action masking and reward shaping showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel routing methods lack generalization across multiple routes and don't leverage large-scale traffic data. The challenge involves navigating dynamic waterways with changing environmental conditions and operational constraints.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization, recurrent networks, and invalid-action masking. Agents learn to select direction and speed in continuous observation space with multi-discrete actions. Reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind resistance, and route diversity using AIS-derived traffic graphs and ERA5 wind fields.

Result: Action masking yields clear improvement in policy performance. Supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive shaping rewards produces additional gains. Demonstrated effectiveness in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning framework successfully addresses vessel routing challenges by learning adaptable routes across multiple origin-destination pairs while optimizing for multiple operational objectives through advanced RL techniques.

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

*Tim Schwabe,Moritz Lange,Laurenz Wiskott,Maribel Acosta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient-based causal discovery methods are vulnerable to distributional biases including Marginal Distribution Asymmetry and Marginal Distribution Shift Asymmetry, which can skew causal learning even in synthetic data. The paper demonstrates these biases and shows how eliminating competition between causal factorizations can make models robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based causal discovery methods show promise for efficient causal structure learning, but they can be susceptible to distributional biases in the training data that may lead to incorrect causal inferences.

Method: The authors identify two specific biases (Marginal Distribution Asymmetry and Marginal Distribution Shift Asymmetry) and examine their impact using simple models that learn marginal or conditional distributions. They use bivariate categorical setup with Dirichlet priors and evaluate two existing approaches.

Result: The study demonstrates that gradient-based causal discovery models are susceptible to both identified biases, even in controlled synthetic data. However, the biases can be controlled, and eliminating competition between possible causal factorizations makes models robust to these biases.

Conclusion: Distributional biases pose significant challenges to gradient-based causal discovery methods, but these biases can be mitigated through appropriate model design that avoids competition between causal factorizations, leading to more reliable causal structure learning.

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradES is a gradient-based early stopping method that freezes individual transformer components when their gradients converge, eliminating validation passes and speeding up training 1.57-7.22x while improving accuracy by 1.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional early stopping requires costly validation inference for large transformers. Different transformer components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning, suggesting inefficient simultaneous parameter updates.

Method: Tracks gradient magnitudes in attention projections and FFN matrices during backpropagation. Freezes individual projection matrices when their gradients fall below convergence threshold τ, allowing slow-converging matrices to continue learning.

Result: Achieves 1.57-7.22x training speedup while improving average accuracy by 1.2% through early prevention of overfitting.

Conclusion: GradES provides an efficient alternative to traditional early stopping by leveraging component-wise gradient convergence, eliminating validation costs while enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Result: SQS achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art activation functions while enabling weight-based interpretability without the drawbacks of existing techniques.

Conclusion: SQS provides an effective solution for deriving meaningful, interpretable features directly from neural network weights while maintaining high performance, offering greater guarantees and computational efficiency compared to activation-driven interpretability methods.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based
interpretability

### [230] [Relative Trajectory Balance is equivalent to Trust-PCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01632)
*Tristan Deleu,Padideh Nouri,Yoshua Bengio,Doina Precup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes equivalence between Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) from GFlowNets and Trust-PCL RL method, showing both achieve comparable performance in fine-tuning sequential generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the theoretical gap between GFlowNets and KL-regularized RL methods, specifically showing that RTB and Trust-PCL are equivalent approaches for fine-tuning generative models.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing equivalence between Relative Trajectory Balance objective and Trust-PCL method, followed by empirical validation using illustrative examples from prior RTB work.

Result: Demonstrated that KL-regularized RL methods achieve performance comparable to RTB, providing an alternative perspective to previous findings that suggested RTB superiority.

Conclusion: RTB can be situated within the broader theoretical framework of KL-regularized RL, with both approaches offering effective fine-tuning for sequential generative models.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

### [231] [VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903)
*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISP is an adaptive regularization method that uses gradient volatility to dynamically scale stochastic noise injection in neural networks, improving generalization performance over fixed-noise methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional regularization techniques apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, which may not optimally address overfitting. VISP aims to leverage gradient volatility statistics to provide more targeted and adaptive regularization.

Method: VISP dynamically computes volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic projection matrix. This selectively regularizes inputs and hidden nodes with higher gradient volatility while preserving stable representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN show VISP consistently improves generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives. Analyses reveal it stabilizes internal network dynamics and fosters more robust feature representations.

Conclusion: VISP provides an effective adaptive regularization approach that leverages gradient volatility to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization, outperforming conventional fixed-noise regularization methods.

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal dataset for cognitive load detection that combines established benchmarks with real-world gaming applications, evaluates state-of-the-art models across domains, and finds multimodal approaches outperform unimodal ones but face cross-domain generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task load detection models lack generalizability beyond narrow experimental domains, and there's a gap in evaluating model robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Created a multimodal dataset extending cognitive load benchmarks with real-world gaming using n-back test foundation. Used objective performance, NASA-TLX ratings, and task-level design for annotations. Evaluated xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer architectures across multiple modalities and domains.

Result: Multimodal approaches consistently outperformed unimodal baselines. Performance varied by modality and model architecture depending on application. Models showed reduced performance when transferred to novel domains, highlighting generalization challenges.

Conclusion: The findings provide robust baselines and insights for developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing research in human-computer interaction and adaptive systems.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

*Zhao Wei,Chin Chun Ooi,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-fidelity multi-objective NAS algorithm using Co-Kriging and clustering-based sampling to reduce computational costs, with continuous encoding for U-Net architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of neural architecture search, especially for multiple conflicting objectives, by developing a more efficient optimization approach.

Method: Adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity multi-objective NAS with clustering-based local infill sampling and continuous encoding for cell connections in U-Net backbones.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks, 2D Darcy flow regression, and biomedical image segmentation; successfully applied to wind velocity regression with good prediction and lower complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed NAS algorithm effectively reduces computational costs while discovering optimal architectures, independently validating known U-Net design principles.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

*Sachin Goyal,David Lopez-Paz,Kartik Ahuja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distillation in LLM pretraining improves test-time scaling but impairs in-context learning, particularly induction heads. Analysis using bigram models reveals underlying mechanisms and provides practical design guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent prominence of distillation in LLM pretraining (e.g., Llama-3.2, Gemma) raises questions about its effects on modern LLM paradigms like test-time scaling and in-context learning, which remain underexplored.

Method: Study pretraining with distillation, analyze test-time scaling and in-context learning capabilities, and use a bigram model sandbox to isolate principal factors behind the observations.

Result: Distillation yields models with remarkably better test-time scaling but impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly those modeled via induction heads. Bigram model analysis helps isolate the common principal factor.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into distillation's trade-offs and offer guidance on pretraining design choices for practitioners to balance test-time scaling benefits with in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel spatiotemporal learning model using only two graphs (ongoing and global) for logistical demand-supply forecasting in food delivery platforms, outperforming traditional long time-series methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial-temporal methods struggle to effectively capture future order distribution information due to strong randomness and time-series-insensitive nature in online delivery platforms.

Method: Uses ongoing and global graphs with adaptive future graph learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) to extract future order distribution information.

Result: Achieves superior performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances forecasting performance and is validated effective in real-world production environments.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

*Zhi-Feng Wei,Wenqian Chen,Panos Stinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants with bidirectional cross-conditioning that match or exceed modified DeepONet accuracy while maintaining vanilla DeepONet efficiency across multiple PDE benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the simple but less accurate vanilla DeepONet and the accurate but computationally expensive modified DeepONet by introducing dynamic cross-conditioning between branch and trunk networks.

Method: Proposed Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that enable bidirectional information exchange: query-point information to branch network and input-function information to trunk network, preserving vanilla DeepONet's simplicity non-intrusively.

Result: Experiments on four PDE benchmarks (advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries) show variants that match or surpass modified DeepONet accuracy with improved training efficiency. Best variant selection aligns with each equation's physical characteristics.

Conclusion: Cross-conditioning effectiveness depends on equation characteristics and underlying physics. The proposed variants provide accuracy-efficiency trade-off improvements validated through rigorous statistical analyses including Wilcoxon test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman correlation.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

### [237] [Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046)
*Kaiyue Wen,David Hall,Tengyu Ma,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study reveals that claimed 1.4-2x optimizer speedups over AdamW are overstated due to unfair comparisons. Proper hyperparameter tuning and evaluation show matrix-based optimizers like Muon and Soap offer only 1.1x speedup for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address methodological shortcomings in optimizer comparisons that have obscured fair evaluations and hindered practical adoption of alternatives to AdamW in language model pretraining.

Method: Conducted systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x Chinchilla optimum), with rigorous hyperparameter tuning and end-of-training evaluations.

Result: Matrix-based optimizers (Muon, Soap) show speedup but inversely proportional to model scale: 1.4x for 0.1B models decreasing to 1.1x for 1.2B models. Intermediate checkpoint comparisons are misleading due to learning rate decay effects.

Conclusion: Fair optimizer comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across model scales at training completion. While matrix-based optimizers are fastest, their practical advantage diminishes significantly with increasing model size.

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

### [238] [Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02048)
*Yi Yin,Guangquan Zhang,Hua Zuo,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel bilevel optimization framework for private dataset publication that balances data utility (upper-level) and privacy protection (lower-level) using geometric curvature analysis to mitigate membership inference attacks while maintaining data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy-preserving techniques like data perturbation and synthetic data generation often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and diversity, creating a need for better balance between privacy preservation and data utility for downstream tasks.

Method: Bilevel optimization framework with upper-level focusing on data utility (discriminator-guided generation for high-quality samples) and lower-level focusing on privacy (using local extrinsic curvature on data manifold to measure individual vulnerability to MIA, perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions).

Result: Extensive experiments show enhanced resistance to membership inference attacks in downstream tasks while surpassing existing methods in sample quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The framework achieves synergistic balance between privacy and utility through alternating optimization, providing effective protection against MIA while maintaining high data fidelity for practical applications.

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel multi-modal autoencoder architecture using IMUs and microphones for real-time vehicle wear and tear detection, achieving 92% ROC-AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of vehicle damage is labor-intensive and error-prone, while image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and underbody damage detection due to limited visual access.

Method: Multi-modal autoencoder-based architecture integrating IMU and microphone sensors in a compact windshield-mounted device, with ensemble pooling for improved performance.

Result: The ensemble pooling multi-modal model achieved the highest performance with 92% ROC-AUC, outperforming unimodal and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time damage detection without resource-intensive sensors and can be extended to automotive safety systems and autonomous vehicle collision detection.

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Method: Created a two-level hierarchical graph representation with Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within Function Call Graphs (FCGs) to preserve structural semantics essential for robust malware detection.

Result: The dataset comprises over 200M CFGs nested within 595K FCGs, and large-scale analysis reveals distinct structural properties between benign and malicious software.

Conclusion: HiGraph serves as a foundational benchmark for the community, providing a hierarchical graph representation that improves resilience to code obfuscation and malware evolution, with publicly available dataset and tools.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset

nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly

*Georgios Papoudakis,Thomas Coste,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoLS is a novel off-policy RL algorithm that improves sample efficiency for fine-tuning foundation models on mobile app control tasks by applying direct policy updates for positive samples and conservative regularized updates for negative samples, achieving significant performance gains with reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning using foundation models for multi-turn tasks faces challenges with sparse rewards and policy gradient updates, where negative samples can harm model performance while positive samples don't require regularization.

Method: SoLS uses a modified off-policy actor-critic approach with direct policy updates for positive samples and conservative regularized updates for negative samples, augmented with Successful Transition Replay (STR) to prioritize learning from successful interactions.

Result: SoLS significantly outperforms existing methods on AndroidWorld benchmark (at least 17% relative increase), requires substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods, and achieves 5-60x faster inference.

Conclusion: The proposed SoLS algorithm effectively addresses the limitations of foundation model-based RL by distinguishing update strategies for positive and negative samples, leading to improved sample efficiency and performance in mobile app control tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conditional-t³VAE improves generative fairness on imbalanced datasets by enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes using per-class Student's t-distribution priors, outperforming existing methods in severe class imbalance scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAEs with global priors mirror training set class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. Even t³VAE with heavy-tailed priors still allocates latent volume proportionally to class frequency.

Method: Proposes Conditional-t³VAE with per-class Student's t joint priors over latent and output variables to prevent majority class dominance. Uses γ-power divergence for optimization and derives equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions for class-balanced generation.

Result: Achieves lower FID scores than t³VAE and Gaussian-based VAEs on SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, particularly under severe class imbalance. Outperforms conditional Gaussian VAE in per-class F1 evaluations across all highly imbalanced settings.

Conclusion: While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance, Conditional-t³VAE substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in extreme imbalance regimes by ensuring equitable latent space allocation.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

TL;DR: Extension of CMMN method with two new approaches for EEG spectral normalization that enables cross-dataset mapping and improves independent component classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG recordings contain artifacts, noise, and equipment-specific variations that hinder automated artifact removal and machine learning performance in clinical applications like epilepsy and psychosis diagnosis.

Method: Proposed two alternative approaches for computing source reference spectrum in CMMN: (1) channel-averaged L1-normalized barycenter, and (2) subject-to-subject mapping finding closest spectrum match. Creates space-time separable filters for cross-dataset mapping.

Result: Significant improvement in recognizing brain vs non-brain independent components (ICs) in classification tasks, enabling better artifact removal.

Conclusion: The extended CMMN method with novel spectrum computation approaches effectively normalizes EEG spectral differences, improves IC classification performance, and enables mapping between datasets with different channel configurations.

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

TL;DR: A novel dynamic verification framework for medical LLMs that uses interactive reinforcement learning with patient simulation and clinical rubrics, resulting in Baichuan-M2 model that outperforms most models on HealthBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between medical LLM performance on static benchmarks (like USMLE) and real-world clinical utility, as traditional exams fail to capture dynamic, interactive medical consultations.

Method: Dynamic verification framework with Patient Simulator (using de-identified medical records) and Clinical Rubrics Generator. Multi-stage reinforcement learning with improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to train Baichuan-M2 (32B parameters).

Result: Baichuan-M2 outperforms all open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving score above 32 on HealthBench Hard (previously exceeded only by GPT-5).

Conclusion: Robust dynamic verifier systems are essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing new Pareto front in performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

*Lucas Mansilla,Rodrigo Echeveste,Camila Gonzalez,Diego H. Milone,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BM-CL framework uses continual learning principles to mitigate ML biases without sacrificing performance for advantaged groups, treating bias mitigation as a domain-incremental learning problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bias mitigation techniques cause leveling-down effect where improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups reduces performance for advantaged groups, creating an undesirable trade-off.

Method: Leverages continual learning techniques (Learning without Forgetting, Elastic Weight Consolidation) to reinterpret bias mitigation as a continual learning problem, allowing incremental fairness balancing while preserving original knowledge.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets show effective bias mitigation while minimizing loss of original knowledge, demonstrating improved outcomes for disadvantaged groups without harming advantaged groups.

Conclusion: BM-CL successfully bridges fairness and continual learning fields, offering a promising approach for developing equitable and effective ML systems without the leveling-down trade-off.

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

TL;DR: ST-Hyper proposes adaptive hypergraph modeling to capture high-order dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales in multivariate time series forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes in multivariate time series forecasting.

Method: Uses Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) to extract multi-scale features and Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) to learn sparse hypergraphs for capturing high-order dependencies through tri-phase hypergraph propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six real-world datasets with average MAE reductions of 3.8% for long-term and 6.8% for short-term forecasting compared to best baselines.

Conclusion: ST-Hyper effectively models complex spatial-temporal dependencies through hypergraph learning and demonstrates superior forecasting performance across both short and long-term horizons.

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient federated distillation method for LLMs with adaptive Top-k logit selection and aggregation to reduce communication overhead by ~50% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning for LLMs faces high communication overhead from parameter-sharing methods, and federated distillation with logits still struggles with high-dimensional logits from LLMs in bandwidth-limited scenarios.

Method: Adaptive Top-k logit selection for dynamic sparsification, adaptive logits aggregation to handle dimensional inconsistency, and LoRA-adapted hidden-layer projection to enhance distillation with reduced communication.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to baseline methods while reducing communication overhead by approximately 50%.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively addresses communication challenges in federated LLM distillation through adaptive sparsification and aggregation techniques, achieving significant overhead reduction without compromising performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic time series forecasting methods have suboptimal distribution modeling and training-evaluation metric mismatch. Surprisingly, augmenting point estimators with zero-mean Gaussian matching training error performs well.

Method: Propose RDIT framework combining point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with bidirectional Mamba network. Theoretically derive optimal standard deviation for CRPS minimization and distribution matching algorithms.

Result: Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets show RDIT achieves lower CRPS, faster inference, and improved coverage compared to strong baselines across varied forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: RDIT provides effective plug-and-play framework for probabilistic time series forecasting with theoretical guarantees for optimal performance and practical advantages in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: The Decision Transformer framework provides a more robust, scalable, and flexible solution for notification optimization, demonstrating practical advantages over traditional offline RL methods in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Surrogate benchmarks for hyperparameter optimization in model merging to reduce computational costs


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model merging hyperparameter tuning is computationally expensive, especially for LLMs, but essential for performance improvement

Method: Define search spaces, collect data samples, and construct surrogate models to predict merged model performance from hyperparameters

Result: Benchmarks can predict merged model performance well and simulate optimization algorithm behaviors effectively

Conclusion: Surrogate benchmarks enable low-cost development and comparison of hyperparameter optimization algorithms for model merging

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-ICL+FCP is a novel conformal prediction framework that combines in-context learning with permutation-invariant Transformers and CP-aware loss to achieve efficient full conformal prediction without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods face trade-offs: split CP is data-inefficient due to dataset partitioning, while full CP is computationally prohibitive due to retraining complexity. Current meta-learning/ICL approaches don't optimize specifically for CP, leading to large prediction sets.

Method: Enhanced ICL-based FCP (E-ICL+FCP) uses a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model trained with CP-aware loss to simulate multiple retrained models without actual retraining, preserving coverage while reducing computational overhead.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real tasks show E-ICL+FCP achieves superior efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP provides an effective solution that maintains distribution-free coverage guarantees while significantly improving both data efficiency and computational efficiency over traditional conformal prediction methods.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

TL;DR: Semi-on-demand transit feeder using shared autonomous vehicles with RL-based zonal dispatching control, combining fixed-route efficiency with demand-responsive flexibility for better accessibility in low-density areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility in lower-density areas by combining cost-effectiveness of fixed-route transit with adaptability of demand-responsive transport using autonomous vehicles.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning model using Proximal Policy Optimization to dynamically assign vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones based on real-time demand fluctuations, demonstrated through agent-based simulations on a real-world Munich bus route.

Result: The semi-on-demand service with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs compared to traditional fixed-route service, with RL control contributing 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.

Conclusion: Shows potential for integrating SAV feeders and machine learning in public transit, providing groundwork for addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Motivation: Traditional optimization methods for post-disaster road damage assessment suffer from excessive computational time and require domain knowledge, making them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios where rapid response is critical.

Result: Outperforms commercial solvers by 16-69% in solution quality; achieves real-time inference (1-2 seconds vs 100-2000 seconds); strong generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time constraints; performs well on unseen parameter distributions and real-world networks.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid decision-making is essential for saving lives.

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid

*Raunak Kunwar,Aera Kim LeBoulluec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning analysis of NCAP safety ratings shows that while traditional vehicle characteristics (curb weight, model year) are most predictive of 5-star ratings, ADAS features also contribute meaningfully to achieving top safety scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) interact with traditional vehicle attributes in predicting the highest NCAP safety ratings, as safety assessment evolves to include both passive and active safety technologies.

Method: Used four machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, SVC) on NCAP dataset of 5,128 vehicles (2011-2025) with 5-fold cross-validation. Optimized best models (random forest and gradient boost) with RandomizedSearchCV.

Result: Random forest achieved 89.18% accuracy and 0.9586 ROC AUC. Feature importance analysis showed curb weight and model year contributed over 55% of predictive power, but ADAS features also provided meaningful contributions.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively analyze NCAP data, revealing that both traditional vehicle parameters and modern ADAS features are important for achieving top safety ratings, with basic characteristics dominating but ADAS adding predictive value.

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous causal disentanglement research focused on i.i.d. data, but many real-world scenarios involve structured network data where observations are not independent. There's a need to extend causal discovery methods to leverage this structured context.

Method: GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover latent causal graphs and intervention effects from network-structured data.

Result: Theoretical results show identifiability from i.i.d. data holds in the network setting. Empirical evaluation on three genetic perturbation datasets demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines when leveraging structured context.

Conclusion: Structured network context significantly improves causal disentanglement performance. GraCE-VAE successfully extends causal discovery to non-i.i.d. settings while maintaining theoretical guarantees from i.i.d. scenarios.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

TL;DR: A three-phase framework integrating process-based models with machine learning through knowledge distillation for intelligent ecohydrological modeling


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional process-based models (structural rigidity, high computational costs) and machine learning methods (lack of interpretability and transferability) in ecohydrological simulation

Method: Three-phase knowledge distillation framework: Phase I (behavioral distillation) uses surrogate learning for model simplification; Phase II (structural distillation) reformulates process equations as GNN components; Phase III (cognitive distillation) embeds expert reasoning using Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture

Result: Successfully demonstrated for Samish watershed, reproducing process-based model outputs, improving predictive accuracy, and supporting scenario-based decision-making

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and transferable pathway toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems with potential extension to other process-based domains

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the

### [257] [Semantic and episodic memories in a predictive coding model of the neocortex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01987)
*Lucie Fontaine,Frédéric Alexandre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive coding models can exhibit episodic memory capabilities when trained on few examples, but lose this ability with more training data, supporting the need for separate hippocampal episodic memory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional Complementary Learning Systems theory by exploring whether neocortical predictive coding models can demonstrate hippocampus-like episodic memory capabilities and understand the relationship between semantic and episodic memory.

Method: Developed a predictive coding model of the neocortex and tested its episodic memory capabilities by training it on varying numbers of examples to assess recall performance and generalization.

Result: The predictive coding model could recall specific individual examples when trained on a small number of examples, but became overfitted and lost recall capabilities when trained on many examples, showing poor generalization.

Conclusion: Episodic memory can arise from semantic learning in limited cases, but the neocortex's dense, overlapping representations can only encode a limited number of specific examples, validating the need for the hippocampus's sparse, pattern-separated representations for true episodic memory.

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

*Yohei Saito,Shun Kimura,Koujin Takeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes combining parallel tempering with bouncy particle sampler to accelerate convergence for multimodal posterior distributions, with infinite inverse temperature exchange rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian inference requires sampling from posterior distributions, but existing methods like HMC and MCMC have limitations. BPS offers easier parameter setting but needs acceleration for multimodal distributions.

Method: Introduces parallel tempering to bouncy particle sampler with infinite inverse temperature exchange rate to improve convergence speed.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate effectiveness for multimodal distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully accelerates convergence of BPS for complex multimodal posterior distributions.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

*Aref Einizade,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros,Jhony H. Giraldo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces second-order tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (So-TPDEGs) to overcome limitations of first-order methods, enabling better capture of complex multi-scale structures while preserving high-frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continuous graph methods are limited to first-order derivatives, which dampen high-frequency signals and slow information propagation, making them ineffective for complex, multi-scale, and heterophilic structures.

Method: Proposes second-order TPDEGs framework that leverages separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs for efficient spectral decomposition while preserving high-frequency information.

Result: Provides rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties.

Conclusion: Establishes a robust theoretical foundation for advancing continuous graph learning across multiple practical domains with improved handling of complex multi-scale structures.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

### [260] [Genetic Programming with Model Driven Dimension Repair for Learning Interpretable Appointment Scheduling Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02034)
*Huan Zhang,Yang Wang,Ya-Hui Jia,Yi Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dimensionally aware genetic programming algorithm with dimension repair is developed to evolve high-quality, interpretable appointment scheduling rules that maintain dimensional consistency while outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional genetic programming for appointment rules can produce results that are difficult for medical practitioners to interpret and trust due to lack of dimensional consistency, which is crucial for aligning with domain knowledge.

Method: Developed a dimensionally aware GP algorithm with dimension repair procedure that uses mixed-integer linear programming to optimize dimensional consistency while minimizing structural changes and ensuring output dimension requirements.

Result: The method evolved high-quality appointment rules that significantly outperformed manually designed rules and existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP methods in both objective performance and dimensional consistency across simulated clinics.

Conclusion: The dimension repair approach enables exploration of wider rule structures while maintaining interpretability, providing insights for designing more effective and trustworthy appointment scheduling rules in healthcare operations.

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

*Haiwen Guan,Troy Arcomano,Ashesh Chattopadhyay,Romit Maulik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUCIE-3D is a lightweight 3D climate emulator that captures atmospheric vertical structure, responds to climate forcings like CO2, and maintains computational efficiency while reproducing key climate patterns and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient 3D climate model that can capture vertical atmospheric structure, respond to climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency for rapid experimentation in climate research.

Method: Uses Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone trained on 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data across 8 vertical levels, incorporates CO2 as forcing variable, and optionally integrates prescribed sea surface temperatures.

Result: Successfully reproduces climatological means, variability, long-term climate change signals (surface warming, stratospheric cooling), captures key dynamical processes (equatorial Kelvin waves, MJO, annular modes), and shows credible extreme event statistics.

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D combines stability, physical consistency, and accessibility, making it valuable for rapid experimentation, ablation studies, and coupled climate dynamics exploration, with potential applications in paleoclimate and Earth system emulation.

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

*Srinivas Anumasa,Barath Chandran. C,Tingting Chen,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that uses kernel density estimation to determine data-specific noise scales for diffusion models, improving protein generation in sparse data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models ignore the uneven sparsity in protein data distributions, where samples cluster unevenly with varying density across the data space.

Method: Uses kernel density estimation (KDE) as preprocessing to estimate noise scale σ for each data point, then trains a score model with these data-dependent σ values to incorporate local data geometry.

Result: Empirical evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple metrics compared to approaches that ignore data-dependent variability.

Conclusion: Data-aware sigma prediction is crucial for effective generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional settings like protein data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

*Jian Chen,Jinbao Tian,Yunqi Xu,Zhou Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABEX-RAT is a novel framework combining generative data augmentation and adversarial training to address class imbalance in occupational accident report classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 90.32% macro-F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Severe class imbalance in occupational accident datasets compromises analytical model performance, especially for rare but severe incident types, hindering reliable automated classification systems.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) ABEX pipeline uses LLM to distill core incident semantics and generative model to create diverse synthetic samples for underrepresented classes; 2) Lightweight classifier trained with random adversarial training (RAT) that stochastically applies perturbations for enhanced generalization.

Result: Achieved new SOTA performance on OSHA dataset with 90.32% macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines.

Conclusion: The synergistic strategy of generative data augmentation with adversarial training is highly effective and efficient alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced classification tasks.

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

*Long Shi,Yunshan Ye,Wenjie Wang,Tao Lei,Yu Zhao,Gang Kou,Badong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIML is a new multi-view learning framework that considers both common and unique information from different views, challenging the traditional multi-view redundancy assumption that only common information matters for prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view methods assume that only common information between views is important for downstream tasks, ignoring the potential predictive value of unique information in each view. This paper aims to develop a more comprehensive framework that leverages both types of information.

Method: CIML uses information theory principles: 1) Common representation learning maximizes Gacs-Korner common information and compresses it using Information Bottleneck, 2) Unique representation learning applies IB to compress unique features while minimizing mutual information between unique and common representations and among different unique representations.

Result: The framework theoretically proves that the learned joint representation is predictively sufficient for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show CIML outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIML successfully challenges the multi-view redundancy assumption and demonstrates that considering both common and unique information leads to superior performance in multi-view learning tasks.

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust model merging method using Jensen-Shannon divergence to combine multiple task-specific models into one while maintaining performance across all tasks and handling task interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address task interference in multi-task learning when merging multiple fine-tuned models, especially as the number of tasks increases, without requiring additional labeled data.

Method: Leverages Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the model merging process, automatically balances task importance, and handles multiple tasks robustly.

Result: Outperforms prior work consistently and remains robust as the number of tasks grows, maintaining strong performance across all merged tasks.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively solves task interference in model merging, provides automatic task balancing, and scales well with increasing task numbers.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EM algorithm is widely used but treated as non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern end-to-end gradient-based learning systems.

Method: Present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM (from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods), apply to Mixture Wasserstein distance computation between GMMs, and introduce novel stability results and unbalanced variant.

Result: Successfully enables differentiable EM integration, allowing MW₂ to be used as differentiable loss in various applications including barycentre computation, colour/style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis.

Conclusion: The approach provides versatile and effective differentiable EM framework with theoretical justification, enabling new applications in imaging and machine learning tasks that require end-to-end gradient propagation.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces threshold-based multi-armed bandit problems where arms are selected based on their relation to a prescribed threshold τ, rather than simply finding the highest reward arm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by applications in communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management, and recommendation systems where decisions need to be made relative to specific thresholds rather than maximizing rewards.

Method: The authors study various threshold-based variants (first above τ, k-th arm above/below, closest to τ) under monotonic arm mean structure. They derive asymptotic regret lower bounds and propose algorithms with optimality validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The research shows that regret lower bounds depend only on arms adjacent to the threshold τ, and they develop algorithms that achieve optimal performance in these threshold-constrained bandit settings.

Conclusion: This work extends classical bandit theory by incorporating threshold constraints, providing efficient decision-making frameworks for practical applications where decisions must be made relative to specific target values rather than simply maximizing rewards.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

Motivation: Current VPR approaches using Vision Foundation Models and MLLMs suffer from high computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned, requiring a more efficient and generalizable solution.

Method: Proposes Test-Time Scaling (TTS) framework that leverages MLLMs' vision-language alignment through Guidance-based methods for direct similarity scoring, using structured prompts for length-controllable JSON outputs and Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency for real-time adaptation.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210x computational efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot TTS framework effectively addresses computational overhead and cross-domain limitations of current VPR methods while maintaining high performance through efficient MLLM utilization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large

vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First principled method for online, data-driven causal model identification of IT systems using active causal learning with Gaussian process regression and rollout-based interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-designed causal models are inadequate for modern complex IT systems; need automated methods for system management tasks like prediction, optimization, diagnosis, and intrusion detection.

Method: Active causal learning using Gaussian process regression with rollout-based intervention policy to iteratively estimate causal functions from system measurements.

Result: Method is proven optimal in Bayesian sense and produces effective interventions; experimental validation shows accurate causal model identification with low operational interference.

Conclusion: The approach enables automated, data-driven causal modeling of IT systems, addressing the limitations of manual expert design in complex, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

### [270] [Simulating classification models to evaluate Predict-Then-Optimize methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02191)
*Pieter Smet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how prediction errors from machine learning models affect solution quality in Predict-Then-Optimize frameworks, introduces a new algorithm for simulating multiclass classifier predictions, and demonstrates that the relationship between prediction accuracy and solution optimality is complex and non-trivial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Predict-Then-Optimize approach assumes that more accurate predictions lead to better solutions, but this assumption lacks empirical evidence for complex constrained optimization problems. The authors aim to experimentally analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without training real models.

Method: The authors develop a new algorithm for simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers, complementing existing binary classification simulation methods. They conduct computational studies to evaluate algorithm performance and apply these simulation algorithms to assess a Predict-Then-Optimize approach for machine scheduling problems.

Result: The simulation algorithms can replicate classifier performance with reasonable accuracy, though some variability is observed. Experiments reveal that the relationship between prediction error and solution optimality is non-trivial - better predictions don't always guarantee solutions closer to the actual optimum.

Conclusion: The findings highlight important considerations for designing and evaluating decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions, showing that the assumed direct relationship between prediction accuracy and solution quality in Predict-Then-Optimize frameworks may not hold in complex optimization contexts.

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DaCe AD is a novel automatic differentiation engine that requires no code modifications and uses ILP-based optimization to balance storage vs recomputation, achieving 92x speedup over JAX on HPC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD frameworks have limitations including limited language support, need for code modifications, poor performance on scientific computing codes, and inefficient storage solutions, forcing scientists to manually compute gradients.

Method: DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the trade-off between storing and recomputing forward-pass data to achieve maximum performance within memory constraints, without requiring code modifications.

Result: Outperforms JAX by more than 92 times on average across NPBench HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing patterns, without requiring any code changes.

Conclusion: DaCe AD provides a general, efficient automatic differentiation solution that eliminates the need for manual gradient computation and code modifications while delivering significant performance improvements for scientific computing applications.

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code

### [272] [Calibration through the Lens of Indistinguishability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02279)
*Parikshit Gopalan,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey paper on calibration in probabilistic predictions, exploring how to define and measure calibration error and its implications for decision-making, with a unifying view of calibration as indistinguishability between predicted and real worlds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental question of how to interpret predicted probabilities in machine learning, given the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions and the need to evaluate predictors that output continuous probabilities against discrete observed outcomes.

Method: Survey and synthesis of recent work on calibration, analyzing different approaches to defining and measuring calibration error, and examining the relationship between calibration measures and downstream decision-making.

Result: Presents a unifying viewpoint that frames calibration as a form of indistinguishability between the predictor's hypothesized world and the real world, where various calibration measures quantify how well these worlds can be distinguished by different classes of statistical tests.

Conclusion: Calibration serves as a crucial framework for evaluating probabilistic predictions, with different calibration measures capturing different aspects of how well predicted probabilities align with real-world outcomes, ultimately informing how decision-makers should use these predictions.

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

### [273] [Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281)
*Shijie Wang,Li Zhang,Xinyan Liang,Yuhua Qian,Shen Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UDI introduces a sequential training approach that replaces joint loss with unidirectional guidance to prevent modality imbalance in multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional joint loss approaches cause modality imbalance where strong modalities dominate weaker ones, limiting effective information utilization from individual modalities and their interactions.

Method: Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI) first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss, with dynamic adjustment of modality interactions.

Result: Experimental results show UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance and improves performance in multimodal learning tasks.

Conclusion: UDI provides a proactive alternative to reactive joint loss strategies, enabling better modality interactions and information utilization while preventing single modality domination.

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

*Xi Chen,Yuze Chen,Yuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaSwitch meta-algorithm for online decision-making with sequence-based predictions that provides near-optimal performance with accurate predictions while maintaining competitive ratio guarantees with inaccurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multi-period online decision-making problems where predictions from ML models are available but their accuracy is not guaranteed, requiring algorithms that can leverage predictions when accurate while remaining robust to prediction errors.

Method: Introduces a bounded-influence framework where past decisions have limited impact on future optimal rewards, and proposes the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm that adaptively switches between prediction-based and classical competitive algorithms.

Result: The framework and AdaSwitch algorithm achieve performance close to offline benchmarks when predictions are accurate, while preserving classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions across diverse applications.

Conclusion: The bounded-influence framework and AdaSwitch meta-algorithm provide a flexible and broadly applicable approach to learning-augmented online decision-making that balances prediction exploitation with robustness to prediction errors.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

### [275] [Extrapolated Markov Chain Oversampling Method for Imbalanced Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02332)
*Aleksi Avela,Pauliina Ilmonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Markov chain-based text oversampling method that expands minority class feature space by incorporating majority class information to address severe text classification imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text classification faces unique challenges with imbalanced data where minority classes have limited samples, and traditional oversampling methods don't account for the expanding vocabulary/feature space when generating synthetic text data.

Method: Markov chain-based oversampling that estimates transition probabilities from both minority and majority classes, allowing the minority feature space to expand during synthetic data generation.

Result: The approach produces highly competitive results compared to prominent oversampling methods, especially effective when dealing with severe class imbalance in real text data examples.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses distinctive difficulties of imbalanced text data by expanding minority feature space through majority class-informed Markov chain transitions, demonstrating superior performance in severe imbalance scenarios.

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

*Dongseok Kim,Wonjun Jeong,Gisung Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a strategic framework for analyzing Federated Learning as a system with incentives and rules, introducing indices to quantify behavioral incentives and performance loss, and providing practical guidelines to prevent metric gaming while maintaining cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning success depends on participant behaviors that occur out of sight, requiring analysis beyond mere optimization to understand strategic interactions, rules, and incentives that drive genuine performance improvement versus metric manipulation.

Method: Developed an analytical framework with two indices quantifying behavioral incentives and collective performance loss. Introduced thresholds, auto-switch rules, early warning signals, and a practical algorithm for audit resource allocation. Conducted simulations across diverse environments for validation.

Result: Simulations consistently validated framework predictions across diverse environments. The approach provides performance guarantees and practical operational guidelines that lower incentives for metric gaming while sustaining stable cooperation.

Conclusion: The framework enables clear identification of behaviors that genuinely improve performance versus those targeting metrics. Combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and connectivity-based alarms allows robust application in real-world operations with design principles that expand stable cooperation.

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

### [278] [Evaluating Cumulative Spectral Gradient as a Complexity Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02399)
*Haji Gul,Abdul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critically evaluates the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric for knowledge graph complexity assessment, finding it lacks the claimed scalability and correlation with performance metrics in link prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously assess the CSG metric's behavior on standard knowledge graph benchmarks, as accurate dataset complexity estimation is crucial for evaluating link prediction models but previous claims about CSG may not hold in practice.

Method: Conducted experiments on standard KG benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR) using multi-class tail prediction tasks, systematically varying two key CSG computation parameters: M (Monte Carlo samples per class) and K (number of nearest neighbors in embedding space).

Result: Found that CSG is highly sensitive to parameter K choice and doesn't inherently scale with number of target classes. CSG values showed weak or no correlation with established performance metrics like mean reciprocal rank (MRR), contradicting original claims.

Conclusion: CSG's purported stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction settings, highlighting the need for more robust, classifier-agnostic complexity measures in knowledge graph evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

*Maximilian Weimar,Lukas M. Rachbauer,Ilya Starshynov,Daniele Faccio,Linara Adilova,Dorian Bouchet,Stefan Rotter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to track Fisher information flow through neural networks during parameter estimation, showing optimal performance corresponds to maximal information transmission and providing a model-free training stopping criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As neural networks become integral to measurement systems, understanding how they process parameter-relevant information internally is crucial for optimal estimation performance.

Method: Developed a method to monitor Fisher information flow through ANN layers from input to output during parameter estimation tasks.

Result: Found that optimal estimation corresponds to maximal Fisher information transmission, and overfitting causes information loss. This provides a validation-free stopping criterion.

Conclusion: The Fisher information monitoring approach offers a practical, model-free method to optimize neural network training for parameter estimation without needing separate validation data.

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

*Spyros Angelopoulos,Loris Marchal,Adrien Obrecht,Bertrand Simon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new paging problem for efficient expert management in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, proposing a layer-based LRU extension that outperforms traditional paging policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with billions of parameters face memory management challenges. Mixture-of-Experts architectures reduce activated parameters but require efficient cache management for frequently used experts to avoid slow secondary memory access.

Method: The authors formulate a new paging problem capturing LLM layered architecture and expert caching requirements. They present theoretical lower bounds and propose a layer-based extension of LRU tailored for expert management.

Result: Extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and actual MoE usage traces show the proposed algorithm outperforms classic paging policies like standard LRU.

Conclusion: The layer-based LRU extension provides superior performance for expert management in MoE-based LLMs, addressing critical cache efficiency challenges with strong theoretical foundations and practical validation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

### [281] [Learnable Loss Geometries with Mirror Descent for Scalable and Convergent Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02418)
*Yilang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel meta-learning approach that learns a nonlinear mirror map using neural networks to handle complex loss geometries, enabling faster per-task adaptation with fewer optimization steps compared to linear preconditioning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning faces challenges in sample-efficient adaptation of prior knowledge to new tasks. Linear preconditioning methods are limited in handling complex loss geometries, necessitating a more versatile approach to capture diverse loss landscapes.

Method: Proposes learning a distance-generating function via an expressive neural network that induces a nonlinear mirror map. This function serves as a valid distance metric to optimize various loss geometries effectively.

Result: Achieves convergence rate of O(ε⁻²) for gradient norm < ε, matching standard meta-learning methods. Demonstrates superior performance on few-shot learning datasets with significantly faster per-task convergence and reduced adaptation steps.

Conclusion: The nonlinear mirror map approach effectively handles complex loss metrics, enabling rapid adaptation with fewer optimization steps while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees, making it suitable for large-scale meta-learning applications.

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VASSO improves SAM by stabilizing adversarial perturbations through variance suppression, enhancing generalization across vision and language tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM suffers from 'over-friendly adversaries' that limit generalization performance. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a method to stabilize adversaries for better generalization.

Method: Variance Suppression (VASSO) is proposed to provably stabilize adversaries in SAM. VASSO is integrated with SAM to minimize the maximum loss within adversarial neighborhoods while suppressing variance.

Result: Numerical validation shows improved generalizability on extensive vision and language tasks. VASSO provides a desirable generalization-computation tradeoff when applied to efficient SAM variants.

Conclusion: VASSO successfully addresses the over-friendly adversary problem in SAM, leading to enhanced generalization performance while maintaining computational efficiency across diverse deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimpleTIR is a plug-and-play algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning training by filtering out void turns to prevent gradient explosions and performance collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning suffers from training instability and performance collapse due to distributional drift from external tool feedback, which causes catastrophic gradient norm explosions.

Method: SimpleTIR identifies and filters out trajectories containing void turns (turns that yield neither code blocks nor final answers) to block harmful high-magnitude gradients and stabilize learning dynamics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on math reasoning benchmarks, elevating AIME24 score from 22.1 to 50.5 with Qwen2.5-7B base model, while enabling discovery of diverse reasoning patterns like self-correction and cross-validation.

Conclusion: SimpleTIR effectively addresses training instability in multi-turn TIR by removing problematic trajectories, enabling stable reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning constraints and promoting sophisticated reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

TL;DR: HydroGAT is a spatiotemporal graph neural network that uses high-resolution basin graphs with land and river pixels as nodes, achieving superior flood forecasting accuracy with interpretable attention mechanisms and scalable distributed training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood forecasting methods ignore topological information or collapse spatial resolution, while existing GNN approaches fail to capture simultaneous spatiotemporal interactions critical for accurate prediction.

Method: Proposes a heterogeneous basin graph where every land and river pixel is a node connected by hydrological flow directions, with HydroGAT adaptively learning local temporal importance and influential upstream locations.

Result: Achieves NSE up to 0.97, KGE up to 0.96, and PBIAS within ±5% in hourly discharge prediction across two Midwestern US basins, outperforming five baseline architectures with interpretable attention maps.

Conclusion: HydroGAT provides accurate, interpretable flood forecasting by capturing spatiotemporal interactions at high resolution, with scalable distributed training enabling practical applications in water-resource management.

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Büchi automata face scalability issues with complex system behaviors, and neural networks are increasingly used to address these challenges in verification. This study investigates whether RNNs can generalize beyond training data to handle ω-regular languages.

Method: Train RNNs on ultimately periodic ω-word sequences to replicate target BA behavior, then evaluate generalization on out-of-distribution sequences. Experiments conducted on LTL formulas corresponding to deterministic automata with 3 to over 100 states.

Result: RNNs achieve high accuracy on target ω-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to 8× longer than training examples, with 92.6% of tasks achieving perfect or near-perfect generalization.

Conclusion: This establishes the feasibility of neural approaches for learning complex ω-regular languages and suggests their potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Jie Ye,Murali Emani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoPEQ is a post-training quantization method that assigns optimal bit widths to each expert in MoE-based VLMs using Hessian trace approximation for sensitivity analysis, achieving competitive accuracy with significant memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large MoE-based language and vision models have high computational and memory demands, making deployment challenging. Mixed precision quantization can help but needs better methods to determine optimal bit allocation per expert.

Method: Proposes MoPEQ algorithm that uses Hessian trace approximation to analyze each expert's sensitivity, clusters similar experts, and assigns optimal bit widths (2-4 bits) per expert instead of relying on activation frequency.

Result: Experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmarks show competitive accuracy with substantial memory footprint improvements compared to uniform-precision baselines across Deepseek-VL2 and MolmoE models.

Conclusion: Per-expert granularity quantization using Hessian-based sensitivity analysis effectively balances accuracy and model size for MoE-based VLMs, providing a thorough understanding of mixed precision quantization for these architectures.

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Motivation: To develop efficient methods for learning optimal control policies in diffusion process fine-tuning, overcoming limitations of generic reinforcement learning approaches with better statistical guarantees.

Method: Solving variational inequality problems based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations using general value function approximation, treating fine-tuning as supervised regression rather than generic RL.

Result: Proved sharp statistical rates for learned value functions and control policies, with performance depending on function class complexity and approximation errors. Achieved faster convergence than standard RL methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion process fine-tuning can be effectively achieved through supervised regression approaches rather than generic reinforcement learning, providing superior statistical rate guarantees and more efficient learning.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic
reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be
achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard guardian models like LlamaGuard only detect predefined, static harm categories, limiting their usefulness across different application domains that require custom policies.

Method: Propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, with two approaches: fast detection of policy violations and chain-of-thought reasoning that articulates and justifies model outputs.

Result: Dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models, but in a fraction of the time.

Conclusion: Dynamic guardian models provide flexible, efficient policy enforcement for diverse application domains, overcoming the limitations of static category-based approaches while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match

*Eric J. Michaud,Liv Gorton,Tom McGrath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE scaling laws show feature manifolds can cause pathological behavior where SAEs learn fewer features than available latents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparse autoencoders scale with the number of latents and how feature manifolds influence this scaling behavior.

Method: Adapt a capacity-allocation model from neural scaling literature to analyze SAE scaling, particularly examining the impact of multi-dimensional feature manifolds.

Result: The model identifies distinct scaling regimes, with one pathological regime where feature manifolds cause SAEs to learn significantly fewer features than the number of available latents.

Conclusion: Feature manifolds can negatively impact SAE performance, and preliminary analysis suggests SAEs may operate in this pathological regime in practical applications.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

Abstract: Cybersecurity defense involves interactions between adversarial parties
(namely defenders and hackers), making multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) an ideal approach for modeling and learning strategies for these
scenarios. This paper addresses one of the key challenges to MARL, the
complexity of simultaneous training of agents in nontrivial environments, and
presents a novel policy-based Nash Q-learning to directly converge onto a

TL;DR: Proposes controller synthesis for semi-cooperative multi-agent probabilistic systems using temporal logic and probabilistic model checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional controller synthesis methods are limited to single-agent non-probabilistic systems, but modern systems require handling complex multi-agent probabilistic scenarios with temporal logic specifications.

Method: Combines probabilistic model checking with controller synthesis algorithm for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems using linear temporal logic formulas.

Result: Developed a method that can ensure satisfaction of temporal logic specifications to a certain extent, verified through case studies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses controller synthesis for complex multi-agent probabilistic systems with temporal logic specifications, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of
discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and
control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications.
Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe
control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and
non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the
control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based
on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative
semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the
controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The
controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent.
The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This
paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic
model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a
case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care worldwide, but regulatory interventions are poorly understood due to information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply chains.

Method: Uses Large Language Models to simulate bounded-rational decision-making between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and regulatory agencies through a sequential production game spanning multiple quarters.

Result: ShortageSim reduces resolution-lag percentage for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83%, with simulated durations more aligned to ground truth than zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: Provides a novel computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex, information-scarce supply chains, with open-source code and dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events.

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at
https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel
computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex,
information-scarce supply chains.
