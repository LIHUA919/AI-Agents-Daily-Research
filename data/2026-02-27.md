### [1] [Agent Behavioral Contracts: Formal Specification and Runtime Enforcement for Reliable Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302)
*Varun Pratap Bhardwaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal framework called Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC) brings Design-by-Contract principles to AI agents, enabling runtime enforcement of behavioral specifications to prevent drift and failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software uses formal contracts (APIs, type systems, assertions) to specify correct behavior, but AI agents operate on informal prompts and natural language instructions without behavioral specifications, leading to drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in AI agent deployments.

Method: Introduce ABC framework with contracts C = (P, I, G, R) specifying Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as runtime-enforceable components. Define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction for probabilistic compliance accounting for LLM non-determinism. Prove Drift Bounds Theorem showing contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma. Establish conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains. Implement ABC in AgentAssert runtime enforcement library and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench benchmark with 200 scenarios across 7 models.

Result: Evaluation across 1,980 sessions shows contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

Conclusion: Agent Behavioral Contracts provide a practical, formal framework for specifying and enforcing correct behavior in AI agents, effectively bounding drift, improving compliance, and enabling reliable agent deployments with minimal runtime overhead.

Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

### [2] [Graph Your Way to Inspiration: Integrating Co-Author Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Model Based Scientific Idea Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22215)
*Pengzhen Xie,Huizhi Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GYWI system combines author knowledge graphs with RAG to provide controllable context and traceable inspiration for LLM-generated scientific ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show potential for scientific idea generation but often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways, limiting their practical utility in academic settings.

Method: 1) Construct author-centered knowledge graphs with inspiration source sampling; 2) Use hybrid retrieval (RAG + GraphRAG) for depth+breadth knowledge; 3) Apply reinforcement learning-based prompt optimization to guide LLMs; 4) Evaluate with multi-dimensional assessment framework.

Result: GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, Gemini 2.5) on novelty, reliability, and relevance metrics using arXiv-based evaluation dataset with multi-dimensional assessment.

Conclusion: The GYWI system successfully addresses the limitations of LLMs in scientific idea generation by providing controllable context and traceable inspiration paths, demonstrating superior performance across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.

### [3] [A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163)
*Usman Anwar,Julianna Piskorz,David D. Baek,David Africa,Jim Weatherall,Max Tegmark,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Mihaela van der Schaar,David Krueger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-theoretic framework for detecting and quantifying steganography in LLMs by measuring the asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode hidden content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are showing steganographic capabilities that could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Current detection methods based on classical steganography definitions require known reference distributions of non-steganographic signals, which is infeasible for LLM reasoning. There's a lack of principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviors in LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes a decision-theoretic view of steganography, using the insight that steganography creates information asymmetry between agents. They introduce generalized V-information as a utilitarian framework for measuring usable information within inputs, and define the "steganographic gap" - comparing downstream utility of steganographic signals to agents that can vs. cannot decode hidden content.

Result: The empirical validation shows that the proposed formalism can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel decision-theoretic framework for addressing steganographic reasoning in LLMs that overcomes limitations of classical approaches, offering practical methods for detection, quantification, and mitigation of steganographic behaviors in AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

### [4] [FIRE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Financial Intelligence and Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22273)
*Xiyuan Zhang,Huihang Wu,Jiayu Guo,Zhenlin Zhang,Yiwei Zhang,Liangyu Huo,Xiaoxiao Ma,Jiansong Wan,Xuewei Jiao,Yi Jing,Jian Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRE is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' financial knowledge, combining theoretical exam questions with practical business scenarios across 3,000 financial domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to systematically evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge and practical business application capabilities of large language models in real-world financial scenarios, going beyond basic theoretical knowledge to assess practical value.

Method: The authors created FIRE benchmark with two components: 1) Theoretical assessment using actual financial qualification exam questions; 2) Practical assessment using a systematic evaluation matrix covering complex financial domains and essential business activities, resulting in 3,000 scenario questions (closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions with rubrics).

Result: Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on state-of-the-art LLMs including XuanYuan 4.0 (their financial-domain model). The benchmark provides systematic analysis of LLM capabilities in financial applications and identifies capability boundaries.

Conclusion: FIRE benchmark enables systematic evaluation of LLMs in financial applications, providing theoretical and practical assessment tools. The benchmark and evaluation code are publicly released to advance financial AI research.

Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.

### [5] [Multi-Level Causal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22287)
*Willem Schooltink,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal embeddings as a generalization of causal abstractions, enabling multiple detailed models to be mapped into subsystems of a coarser causal model, with applications to merging datasets from different representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While existing causal abstractions focus on relationships between two models, there's a need for frameworks that can handle multiple detailed models being embedded into a single coarser causal model, particularly for merging datasets from models with different representations.

Method: The authors define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, present a generalized notion of consistency, and define a multi-resolution marginal problem that connects to both statistical and causal marginal problems.

Result: The framework demonstrates relevance for statistical and causal marginal problems, and shows practical utility in merging datasets from models with different representations.

Conclusion: Causal embeddings provide a valuable generalization of causal abstractions that enables more flexible multi-model integration, particularly useful for practical data merging applications across different model representations.

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.

### [6] [Vibe Researching as Wolf Coming: Can AI Agents with Skills Replace or Augment Social Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22401)
*Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents represent a qualitative shift in social science automation, enabling autonomous execution of complete research pipelines through "vibe researching" - similar to "vibe coding" in software development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of AI agents capable of multi-step reasoning with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills represents a fundamental shift from previous automation technologies in social science. Unlike simple chatbots, these agents can autonomously execute entire research workflows from start to finish.

Method: The paper introduces "vibe researching" as the AI-era parallel to "vibe coding," using scholar-skill (a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering full research pipeline) as a case study. It develops a cognitive task framework classifying research activities along two dimensions: codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement, identifying a cognitive delegation boundary that cuts through every research stage rather than between stages.

Result: AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The analysis identifies three key implications for the profession: augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis.

Conclusion: The paper proposes five principles for responsible "vibe researching" to guide the responsible integration of AI agents in social science research, addressing both their capabilities and limitations in professional research workflows.

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

### [7] [Towards Autonomous Memory Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22406)
*Xinle Wu,Rui Zhang,Mustafa Anis Hussain,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: U-Mem proposes autonomous memory agents that actively acquire and validate knowledge using a cost-aware cascade approach and Thompson sampling, significantly outperforming prior memory agents on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory agents are passive and reactive, bounded by available information and rarely seeking external inputs when uncertain. They lack active knowledge acquisition and validation capabilities.

Method: U-Mem implements: (1) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research, and only when needed, expert feedback; (2) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration-exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias.

Result: U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points on both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that autonomous memory agents with active knowledge acquisition, validation, and cost-aware strategies significantly improve LLM performance over passive memory approaches, offering an effective alternative to expensive LLM training.

Abstract: Recent memory agents improve LLMs by extracting experiences and conversation history into an external storage. This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.

### [8] [Exploring Human Behavior During Abstract Rule Inference and Problem Solving with the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22408)
*Caroline Ahn,Quan Do,Leah Bakst,Michael P. Pascale,Joseph T. McGuire,Michael E. Hasselmo,Chantal E. Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers created CogARC, a human-adapted visual reasoning test based on ARC, tested 260 participants, and found high but variable performance with diverse solution strategies revealing insights into human abstract reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cognitive strategies underlying human flexibility in abstract reasoning and how people rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples, by developing a test that can reveal these processes.

Method: Created CogARC, a human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), administered to 260 participants across 75 visual reasoning problems. Collected high-resolution behavioral data including viewing patterns, edit sequences, and submission attempts. Analyzed performance, timing, and solution strategies across two experiments.

Result: Participants showed high success rates (90% in Experiment 1, 80% in Experiment 2) but performance varied widely. Harder problems led to longer deliberation and diverse strategies. Response times decreased over time while accuracy slightly declined. Even incorrect solutions were often convergent, and solution trajectories varied from direct to exploratory paths with partial restarts.

Conclusion: CogARC provides a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, revealing how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt strategies under uncertainty. The findings highlight diverse cognitive approaches to abstract problem-solving and offer insights into the flexibility of human reasoning.

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

### [9] [Epistemic Filtering and Collective Hallucination: A Jury Theorem for Confidence-Calibrated Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22413)
*Jonas Karge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework where agents learn their reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting, extending Condorcet Jury Theorem to confidence-gated settings with applications to AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical voting theories like the Condorcet Jury Theorem assume fixed agent participation, but real-world aggregation benefits from allowing agents to abstain when uncertain. The paper addresses how heterogeneous agents can learn their own reliability and make selective participation decisions to improve collective accuracy.

Method: A probabilistic framework with a calibration phase where agents update beliefs about their fixed competence, followed by a confidence gate determining whether to vote or abstain. The analysis includes deriving non-asymptotic lower bounds on group success probability and proving theoretical guarantees. Empirical validation is conducted via Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The paper proves that selective participation generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the Condorcet Jury Theorem to sequential, confidence-gated settings. It provides non-asymptotic lower bounds on group success probability and validates these bounds through simulations.

Conclusion: The selective participation framework extends classical voting theory to practical settings where agents can abstain, maintaining accuracy guarantees while allowing for uncertainty. The approach has promising applications for AI safety, particularly in mitigating hallucinations in collective LLM decision-making.

Abstract: We investigate the collective accuracy of heterogeneous agents who learn to estimate their own reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting. While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations. While our results are general, we discuss their potential application to AI safety, outlining how this framework can mitigate \textit{hallucinations} in collective LLM decision-making.

### [10] [ArchAgent: Agentic AI-driven Computer Architecture Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22425)
*Raghav Gupta,Akanksha Jain,Abraham Gonzalez,Alexander Novikov,Po-Sen Huang,Matej Balog,Marvin Eisenberger,Sergey Shirobokov,Ngân Vũ,Martin Dixon,Borivoje Nikolić,Parthasarathy Ranganathan,Sagar Karandikar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchAgent is an AI agent system that automatically discovers novel cache replacement policies, achieving state-of-the-art performance gains faster than human designers while revealing simulator vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an exploding demand for compute that requires agile hardware design flows. While generative AI has shown promise in algorithm design and code optimization, bridging this to computer architecture automation could dramatically accelerate hardware innovation.

Method: ArchAgent is built on AlphaEvolve framework and operates as an automated computer architecture discovery system. It designs complete cache replacement policies (including new mechanisms/logic, not just parameters) within the constraints of established cache replacement policy competitions.

Result: ArchAgent achieved: 1) 5.3% IPC speedup over prior SoTA on multi-core Google workloads in 2 days; 2) 0.9% IPC speedup over SoTA on single-core SPEC06 in 18 days; 3) 3-5x faster development than human designers; 4) Additional 2.4% IPC improvement via post-silicon hyperspecialization; 5) Discovery of "simulator escapes" - exploitation of simulator loopholes.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems like ArchAgent represent a transformative force in computer architecture research, enabling rapid discovery of novel hardware designs and revealing vulnerabilities in existing research tools not designed for automated exploration.

Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

### [11] [How Do Latent Reasoning Methods Perform Under Weak and Strong Supervision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22441)
*Yingqian Cui,Zhenwei Dai,Bing He,Zhan Shi,Hui Liu,Rui Sun,Zhiji Liu,Yue Xing,Jiliang Tang,Benoit Dumoulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent reasoning's internal mechanisms show pervasive shortcut behaviors and don't implement faithful structured search, revealing a supervision trade-off between mitigating shortcuts and maintaining diverse hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent reasoning performs multi-step reasoning in continuous latent spaces instead of discrete language tokens, but despite performance improvements, its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood and not fully investigated.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to understand latent representation's role and behavior, examining methods with different supervision levels, identifying shortcut behaviors, and testing the BFS-like exploration hypothesis in latent space.

Result: Found two key issues: 1) pervasive shortcut behavior where models achieve high accuracy without true latent reasoning, and 2) latent representations encode multiple possibilities but don't implement structured search, instead showing implicit pruning and compression. Revealed a supervision trade-off: stronger supervision reduces shortcuts but restricts hypothesis diversity, while weaker supervision allows richer representations but increases shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning methods exhibit fundamental limitations including shortcut behaviors and lack of faithful structured search, with a crucial trade-off in supervision design that balances between mitigating shortcuts and maintaining diverse latent hypotheses.

Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.

### [12] [A Framework for Assessing AI Agent Decisions and Outcomes in AutoML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22442)
*Gaoyuan Du,Amit Ahlawat,Xiaoyang Liu,Jing Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Evaluation Agent (EA) for decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics to evaluate intermediate decisions across four dimensions, detecting faults and reasoning inconsistencies invisible to traditional evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based AutoML systems lack structured evaluation of intermediate decisions, relying solely on outcome-centric metrics that miss important failure modes in the decision-making process.

Method: Introduces an Evaluation Agent (EA) that observes and evaluates AutoML agent decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact, without interfering with execution.

Result: EA achieves 0.919 F1 score in detecting faulty decisions, identifies reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and attributes downstream performance changes ranging from -4.9% to +8.3% to agent decisions.

Conclusion: Decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes invisible to outcome-only metrics, reframing AutoML assessment to audit agent decisions for more reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

Abstract: Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\% to +8.3\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

### [13] [CWM: Contrastive World Models for Action Feasibility Learning in Embodied Agent Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22452)
*Chayan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Contrastive World Model (CWM) improves action feasibility scoring by using contrastive learning with hard-negative examples to better discriminate between physically valid and invalid actions in embodied AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action feasibility scoring methods using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) fail to explicitly teach models to discriminate between physically correct and subtly wrong actions, treating each candidate independently without emphasizing the nuanced differences that matter for physical execution.

Method: CWM fine-tunes a large language model using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples, specifically targeting semantically similar but physically incompatible actions. The approach pushes valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special focus on minimal-edit negatives where single-word changes affect physical outcomes.

Result: CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives, achieves higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs 0.906), and maintains better safety margins (-2.39 vs -3.96) under out-of-distribution stress conditions in the ScienceWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: Contrastive training with hard negatives induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone, making CWM a more reliable action scorer for embodied agent pipelines.

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

### [14] [ConstraintBench: Benchmarking LLM Constraint Reasoning on Direct Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22465)
*Joseph Tso,Preston Schmittou,Quan Huynh,Jibran Hutchins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with directly solving fully specified constrained optimization problems without solvers, achieving only 65% constraint satisfaction at best, with feasibility being the main bottleneck rather than optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are being applied to operational decision-making involving constrained optimization, but existing benchmarks only test if LLMs can formulate problems as solver code. The paper aims to evaluate whether LLMs can directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver.

Method: The authors introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark with 200 tasks across 10 operations research domains. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and optimization objectives. Models must return structured solutions that are checked by a deterministic verifier against all constraints and solver-proven optimums (using Gurobi as ground truth). They evaluate six frontier LLMs on these tasks.

Result: Best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, with feasible solutions averaging 89-96% of Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of solver reference. Large domain variation: feasibility spans from 83.3% (production mix) to 0.8% (crew assignment). Systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location/vehicle routing.

Conclusion: LLMs currently struggle with direct constrained optimization without solver access, with feasibility being the primary bottleneck. There's significant room for improvement, especially in constraint satisfaction. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

Result: Conducted an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance, using the VERO framework.

Conclusion: VERO is released to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents, addressing the need for systematic evaluation and benchmarking in this emerging application area.

Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.

Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.

TL;DR: Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT) is a post-training framework that injects metacognitive behaviors into large reasoning models to prevent structural fragility and reasoning collapse during complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models often fail to produce correct answers even after deriving valid intermediate steps due to deficiencies in self-regulatory control, where valid logic becomes destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or failure to recognize logical sufficiency.

Method: MBT implements two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns.

Result: MBT consistently outperforms baselines across multi-hop QA benchmarks, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks, higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, and effectively eliminating reasoning collapse.

Conclusion: Internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, demonstrating that explicitly injecting metacognitive behaviors can address structural fragility without requiring additional reasoning capacity.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit structural fragility in complex reasoning tasks, failing to produce correct answers even after successfully deriving valid intermediate steps. Through systematic analysis, we observe that these failures frequently stem not from a lack of reasoning capacity, but from a deficiency in self-regulatory control, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or the failure to recognize logical sufficiency. Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning.

### [18] [A Mathematical Theory of Agency and Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22519)
*Wael Hafez,Chenan Wei,Rodrigo Felipe,Amir Nazeri,Cameron Reid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'bipredictability' (P) as a measure of how much information is shared between observations, actions, and outcomes in interactive systems, showing fundamental bounds differ between quantum/classical systems, and distinguishes agency from intelligence in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems can produce successful predictions while their underlying environmental interactions degrade, lacking a principled measure of how effectively they use information between observations, actions, and outcomes.

Method: Developed bipredictability (P) measure from first principles, proved its intrinsic nature and bounds, and validated through experiments with physical systems (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi-turn LLM conversations.

Result: Bipredictability has strict bounds: P can reach 1 in quantum systems, ≤0.5 in classical systems, and lower with agency. Experiments confirmed these bounds. The framework distinguishes agency (capacity to act on predictions) from intelligence (which requires learning, self-monitoring, and adaptation).

Conclusion: Current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. A thalamocortical-inspired feedback architecture that monitors P in real time establishes a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI systems.

Abstract: To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This position paper proposes using cognitive models and AI algorithms as blueprints for designing modular language agents composed of multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many difficult problems exceed the capabilities of individual LLMs, but there's uncertainty about how to effectively combine multiple LLMs into modular agents.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of "agent templates" that specify roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed, then survey existing language agents to identify templates derived from cognitive models and AI algorithms.

Result: The survey reveals that many existing language agents can be understood through templates inspired by cognitive science and AI principles, providing concrete design patterns for modular agent architectures.

Conclusion: Agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI serve as powerful tools for developing effective, interpretable language agents by providing systematic blueprints for combining multiple LLMs.

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

### [20] [Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22539)
*Mohammad Hossein Shokouhi,Vincent W. S. Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic AI framework using LLM-based agents for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN, achieving 41.93% reduction in active O-RUs and 92% memory savings through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing O-RAN works focus on simple intents handled by independent agents, but complex intents requiring agent coordination remain unexplored. There's a need for an agentic AI framework that can translate operator-defined intents into coordinated actions across multiple LLM-based agents.

Method: Proposed framework with multiple specialized LLM-based agents: supervisor agent translates intents into optimization objectives; user weighting agent determines user priority weights using memory-retrieved experience; O-RU management agent activates when energy-saving is needed, using DRL to determine active O-RUs; monitoring agent measures rates and coordinates to guarantee minimum requirements. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable same underlying LLM for all agents.

Result: The framework reduces active O-RUs by 41.93% compared to three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using PEFT reduces memory usage by 92% compared to deploying separate LLM agents.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic AI framework effectively handles complex intents requiring coordinated agent actions in cell-free O-RAN, demonstrating significant energy savings and memory efficiency while maintaining service requirements.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle in specialized domains requiring long-tail knowledge absent from training data. Human experts can provide this knowledge but their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making direct integration into agent planning problematic.

Method: Introduces AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement) framework featuring a Human Feedback Module (HFM) that learns a policy to treat human experts as interactive reasoning tools for on-demand Human-AI collaboration.

Result: Extensive experiments in Minecraft show the framework increases task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: Successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning rather than simply asking for help, demonstrating the effectiveness of treating human experts as interactive reasoning tools through learned policies.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

TL;DR: CourtGuard is a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that uses evidentiary debate for LLM safety evaluation, enabling zero-shot adaptability without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety mechanisms rely on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity - they can't enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining.

Method: CourtGuard reimagines safety evaluation as evidentiary debate using a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that orchestrates adversarial debates grounded in external policy documents.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Demonstrated zero-shot adaptability to Wikipedia Vandalism task (90% accuracy) and automated curation/auditing of 9 novel adversarial attack datasets.

Conclusion: Decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

*Weida Liang,Yiyou Sun,Shuyuan Nan,Chuang Li,Dawn Song,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR) that improves mathematical reasoning by selectively combining strategies from different sources based on their executability, achieving up to +13 points accuracy improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Example-based guidance for mathematical reasoning is often unstable despite correct guidance, due to a gap between strategy usage (whether a strategy appears in successful solutions) and strategy executability (whether the strategy remains effective when used as guidance). The paper identifies systematic differences between human-written and model-generated strategies that lead to complementary strengths and source-dependent reversals.

Method: Proposes Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. The approach involves controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions to understand strategy usage vs. executability differences.

Result: SSR yields reliable improvements across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by up to +13 points on AIME25 and +5 points on Apex for compact reasoning models. The framework outperforms direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance approaches.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling the executability gap between strategy usage and effectiveness, the proposed SSR framework provides a more stable and effective approach to example-based guidance for mathematical reasoning, leveraging complementary strengths of different strategy sources through selective combination.

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating psychometric rater models into AI evaluation pipelines to address systematic errors in human judgments, using item response theory to separate true output quality from rater biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluations are central to AI training and assessment, but these data suffer from systematic errors and biases that are rarely addressed as measurement errors, leading to unreliable conclusions about model performance.

Method: The paper reviews common rater effects (severity and centrality), then applies item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, to separate true output quality from rater behavior. Uses the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example.

Result: Adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance, enabling more reliable and transparent evaluation of AI models.

Conclusion: Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation enables more principled, transparent use of human data, offering a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

*Sanjay Kariyappa,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SideQuest uses LLMs themselves to intelligently compress KV cache for multi-step reasoning tasks, reducing token usage by 65% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-running agentic tasks require multi-hop reasoning across multiple documents, causing LLM context to be dominated by retrieved tokens. This leads to rapid memory growth and degraded decode performance, while existing KV cache compression heuristics fail for multi-step reasoning models.

Method: SideQuest leverages the Large Reasoning Model itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about token usefulness. It frames KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to prevent management tokens from polluting the model's memory, requiring only 215 training samples.

Result: SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

Conclusion: Using the LLM itself for intelligent KV cache compression is effective for multi-step reasoning tasks, achieving significant memory reduction while maintaining accuracy through a parallel auxiliary task design.

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility.

Method: Developed MobilityBench using large-scale anonymized real user queries from Amap, created deterministic API-replay sandbox for reproducible evaluation, and designed multi-dimensional evaluation protocol covering outcome validity, instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency.

Result: Evaluation shows current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks but struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, indicating significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications.

Conclusion: MobilityBench provides a scalable, reproducible benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents, revealing current limitations in handling preference-constrained routing and enabling better development of personalized mobility applications.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

Current approaches (optimization-based strategies and reinforcement learning) lack flexibility and struggle with historical dependencies and observational patterns within MDP frameworks.

Method: Proposes AHBid framework with: 1) High-level generative planner using diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets/constraints while capturing historical context and temporal patterns; 2) Constraint enforcement mechanism; 3) Trajectory refinement mechanism using historical data for adaptability; 4) Control-based bidding algorithm combining historical knowledge with real-time information.

Result: AHBid achieves a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale offline datasets and online A/B tests.

Conclusion: AHBid effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by integrating generative planning with real-time control, significantly improving adaptability and operational efficacy in multi-channel online advertising environments.

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of personalized LLM-powered agents, organizing the literature around four key components (profile modeling, memory, planning, action execution) and analyzing how user adaptation is integrated throughout the agent decision pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-powered agents operate over extended interactions, their effectiveness increasingly depends on personalization - adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time. Personalization needs to permeate the entire decision pipeline rather than remain confined to surface-level generation.

Method: The paper organizes the literature using a capability-oriented taxonomy with four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. It synthesizes representative methods and analyzes how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized across these components.

Result: The survey creates a structured framework for understanding personalized LLM agents, examines evaluation metrics and benchmarks, summarizes application scenarios from general assistance to specialized domains, and highlights cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs.

Conclusion: The survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants by providing a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

*Siyu Jiang,Sanshuai Cui,Hui Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Knob connects deep learning with control theory by mapping neural gating to a second-order mechanical system, creating a tunable safety valve for dynamic calibration with physical parameter controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network calibration methods are static and post-hoc, neglecting the dynamic nature of real-world inference and lacking intuitive interfaces for human operators to adjust model behavior under shifting conditions.

Method: Proposes Knob framework that maps neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system with damping ratio (ζ) and natural frequency (ω_n). Uses logit-level convex fusion as input-adaptive temperature scaling, and imposes second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE) to enable dual-mode inference (standard vs. continuous stream processing).

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and show that in Continuous Mode, gate responses display standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), enabling predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

Conclusion: Knob provides an exploratory architectural interface that allows operators to tune model "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues, establishing a connection between deep learning and classical control theory for dynamic calibration.

Abstract: Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable "safety valve". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

TL;DR: RLHFless: A serverless computing framework for efficient synchronous RLHF training that adapts to dynamic resource demands, reduces computation redundancy, and optimizes resource allocation for faster, cheaper training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF training faces efficiency challenges due to dynamic resource demands, expanding model sizes, and resource wastage from idle time between RL components. Existing RLHF frameworks rely on serverful infrastructures that struggle with fine-grained resource variability, causing overhead and resource wastage during synchronous training.

Method: RLHFless is built on serverless computing environments, adapts to dynamic resource demands, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, uses cost-aware actor scaling that accounts for response length variation, and assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time.

Result: Experiments on physical testbeds and large-scale simulated clusters show RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RLHFless provides an effective serverless framework for scalable synchronous RLHF training that addresses resource inefficiency challenges, offering significant improvements in both speed and cost compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.
  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

TL;DR: Taesar is a data-centric framework that uses contrastive decoding to regenerate target-aligned sequences from multi-domain data, enabling standard models to capture cross-domain dependencies without complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-centric approaches for multi-domain recommendation suffer from poor generalization due to difficulties in capturing subtle sequence dependencies across domains, high computational demands, and negative transfer effects caused by domain gaps in mixed training data.

Method: The Taesar framework employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences, generating enriched datasets that allow standard sequential models to learn intricate dependencies without requiring complex fusion architectures.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Taesar outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes well to various sequential models, effectively combining the strengths of both data-centric and model-centric paradigms.

Conclusion: Taesar provides a practical data-centric solution to cross-domain recommendation challenges by regenerating target-aligned sequences, offering better generalization and computational efficiency compared to complex model-centric approaches.

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models. By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms.

*Qiannian Zhao,Chen Yang,Jinhao Jing,Yunke Zhang,Xuhui Ren,Lu Yu,Shijie Zhang,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGPO introduces an uncertainty-aware RL framework that aligns model uncertainty with reward signals to improve reasoning quality in large reasoning models, addressing the uncertainty-reward mismatch problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for large reasoning models relies solely on binary correctness signals while ignoring model uncertainty, creating a mismatch where high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equally. This prevents models from "knowing what they know" and limits optimization from focusing on correct answers to effective reasoning paths.

Method: EGPO is a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy from token-level likelihoods. It aligns uncertainty with extrinsic correctness through asymmetric calibration, preserving correct reasoning while regulating overconfident failures. It also recovers learning signals from degenerate rollouts without modifying verifiers or rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance for large reasoning models.

Conclusion: EGPO establishes a principled path for advancing large reasoning models through metacognitive entropy calibration, effectively addressing the uncertainty-reward mismatch problem and enabling more effective reasoning optimization.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from "Know What You Know" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.

*Satya Borgohain,Roy Mariathas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Physician disagreement in medical AI evaluation is largely structural (81.8% unexplained variance), with reducible uncertainties (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubling disagreement odds, while irreducible medical ambiguity has no effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sources of physician disagreement in medical AI evaluation datasets, specifically where variance resides and what observable features can explain it.

Method: Decomposed physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset, analyzing various factors including rubric identity, physician identity, metadata labels, normative rubric language, medical specialty, surface features, embeddings, completion quality, and physician-validated uncertainty categories.

Result: Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement; physician identity accounts for 2.4%; dominant 81.8% case-level residual unexplained. Reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) doubles disagreement odds (OR=2.55), while irreducible medical ambiguity has no effect (OR=1.01). Disagreement follows inverted-U with completion quality.

Conclusion: The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is largely structural, but the dissociation between reducible and irreducible uncertainty suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMA-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating long-horizon memory in LLM agents, addressing limitations of existing dialogue-focused benchmarks by using real-world and synthetic agentic trajectories, with AMA-Agent achieving superior performance through causality graphs and tool-augmented retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents focus too much on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions, while real-world agent memory consists of continuous streams of agent-environment interactions primarily composed of machine-generated representations. There's a significant gap between practical applications and current evaluation standards.

Method: Introduces AMA-Bench with two components: (1) real-world agentic trajectories across representative applications with expert-curated QA, and (2) synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons with rule-based QA. Also proposes AMA-Agent with causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval to address limitations of existing memory systems.

Result: Comprehensive study shows existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench due to lack of causality/objective information and lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval. AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest baselines by 11.16%.

Conclusion: AMA-Bench fills a critical gap in evaluating agent memory for real-world applications, and the proposed AMA-Agent with causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval provides a more effective memory system for long-horizon agentic tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

*Yusuke Watanabe,Yohei Kobashi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yasushi Okuno,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to recognize when clinical information is insufficient for making safe decisions, both making premature judgments and over-abstaining, highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decisions often must be made with incomplete information, and clinicians need to identify when available data is sufficient for judgment versus when to abstain. Premature conclusions and unnecessary abstentions both compromise patient safety, creating a critical need to evaluate whether LLMs can properly handle this clinical reasoning challenge.

Method: Developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. The benchmark requires models to consider all possible hypotheses about missing information (including unlikely ones) and verify whether conclusions hold across all scenarios, evaluating the capability to recognize determinability.

Result: Recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention. This occurs despite LLMs correctly explaining underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information scenarios.

Conclusion: Existing benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating LLM safety in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition that leads to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains.

We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

Conclusion: MiroFlow serves as an accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the research community, addressing current limitations in agent frameworks while delivering robust performance across diverse real-world tasks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

TL;DR: Proposes a conceptual model and design principles for agentic AI to make principled judgments about when and how to intervene based on contextual understanding and behavioral meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI increasingly intervenes proactively by inferring users' situations from contextual data but often fails due to lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. There's a need for AI systems that can distinguish between observable situations and user-constructed meaning.

Method: Develops a conceptual model integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). The model separates observable elements from meaningful interpretations and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral outcomes. Derives five agent design principles from this framework.

Result: Proposes a multidisciplinary model grounded in humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering perspectives. Derives five design principles: behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint.

Conclusion: The model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions, addressing the gap in principled decision-making for proactive AI interventions.

Abstract: Agentic AI increasingly intervenes proactively by inferring users' situations from contextual data yet often fails for lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of experimental spectra for chemical molecules, hindering molecular identification in drug discovery and material science. Deep learning shows promise but lacks standardized evaluation due to heterogeneous methods and absence of well-defined benchmarks.

Method: Created FlexMS framework supporting dynamic construction of diverse model architecture combinations, evaluated on preprocessed public datasets using multiple metrics. Analyzed factors like dataset structural diversity, hyperparameters (learning rate, data sparsity), pretraining effects, metadata ablation, and cross-domain transfer learning.

Result: Framework enables systematic evaluation of mass spectrum prediction models, provides insights into performance-influencing factors, and offers practical guidance for model selection. Also includes retrieval benchmarks simulating real-world identification scenarios.

Conclusion: FlexMS addresses the benchmark gap in mass spectrum prediction, facilitating better model comparison and selection for molecular identification applications in drug discovery and material science.

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing presentation agents rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates, lacking adaptability to diverse user intents and effective feedback-driven refinement capabilities.

Method: DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts for long-horizon refinement using environmental observations. It employs environment-grounded reflection that conditions generation on perceptual artifact states (rendered slides) rather than internal reasoning traces.

Result: On diverse presentation-generation scenarios, DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance. The fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive while operating at substantially lower cost.

Conclusion: DeepPresenter demonstrates an effective agentic framework for presentation generation that adapts to user intents, enables feedback-driven refinement through environment-grounded reflection, and generalizes beyond scripted pipelines while maintaining cost efficiency.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence truly contribute to creative mathematical research, or does it merely automate routine calculations while introducing risks of error? We provide empirical evidence through a detailed case study: the discovery of novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules via systematic human-AI collaboration.
  Working with multiple AI assistants, we extended results beyond what manual work achieved, formulating and proving several theorems with AI assistance. The collaboration revealed both remarkable capabilities and critical limitations. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, systematic proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation. However, every step required rigorous human verification, mathematical intuition for problem formulation, and strategic direction.
  We document the complete research workflow with unusual transparency, revealing patterns in successful human-AI mathematical collaboration and identifying failure modes researchers must anticipate. Our experience suggests that, when used with appropriate skepticism and verification protocols, AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery while demanding careful human oversight and deep domain expertise.

### [41] [Towards LLM-Empowered Knowledge Tracing via LLM-Student Hierarchical Behavior Alignment in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22879)
*Xingcheng Fu,Shengpeng Wang,Yisen Gao,Xianxian Li,Chunpei Li,Qingyun Sun,Dongran Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L-HAKT is a knowledge tracing framework that uses LLMs to parse question semantics and hierarchical knowledge dependencies, generates synthetic data via student agents, employs contrastive learning in hyperbolic space to align distributions, and explicitly models hierarchical knowledge structures through hyperbolic curvature optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT methods using ID-based sequences or shallow textual features fail to capture: (1) hierarchical evolution of cognitive states, and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling.

Method: 1) Teacher agent uses LLMs to deeply parse question semantics and construct hierarchical knowledge dependencies. 2) Student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. 3) Contrastive learning between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences. 4) Optimize hyperbolic curvature to model tree-like hierarchical knowledge structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of the L-HAKT framework.

Conclusion: The proposed L-HAKT framework successfully addresses limitations of existing KT methods by capturing hierarchical cognitive state evolution and individualized difficulty perception through LLM-based semantic modeling and hyperbolic space alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) diagnoses students' concept mastery through continuous learning state monitoring in education.Existing methods primarily focus on studying behavioral sequences based on ID or textual information.While existing methods rely on ID-based sequences or shallow textual features, they often fail to capture (1) the hierarchical evolution of cognitive states and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.

*Xiaoxi Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Jiarui Jin,Shijian Wang,Guanting Dong,Jiajie Jin,Hao Wang,Yinuo Wang,Ji-Rong Wen,Yuan Lu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGAIA: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating omni-modal AI agents across vision, audio, and language with complex reasoning and tool use, plus OmniAtlas as a native omni-modal foundation agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs are limited to bi-modal interactions (like vision-language) and lack unified cognitive capabilities for general AI assistants. There's a gap in evaluating and developing agents that can handle deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across multiple modalities simultaneously.

Method: 1) Created OmniGAIA benchmark using novel omni-modal event graph approach to synthesize complex, multi-hop queries from real-world data requiring cross-modal reasoning and tool integration. 2) Developed OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception, trained using hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction.

Result: Proposed both a comprehensive evaluation benchmark (OmniGAIA) and a native omni-modal foundation agent (OmniAtlas) that enhances tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. The benchmark covers video, audio, and image modalities with tasks requiring deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution.

Conclusion: This work represents a step toward next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios by addressing current limitations in multi-modal AI systems and providing both evaluation framework and improved agent architecture.

Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic framework for evaluating general-purpose agents across diverse environments without domain-specific engineering, demonstrating that current agents can perform comparably to specialized agents even without environment-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The promise of general-purpose agents remains unfulfilled, with existing agents being predominantly specialized and no systematic evaluation of their general performance. Current benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, preventing fair evaluation of general agents.

Method: Proposes conceptual principles for general-agent evaluation, a Unified Protocol for agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. Benchmarks five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard.

Result: Experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents by releasing the evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard, framing general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective.

Abstract: The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FactGuard: An agentic framework using MLLMs with iterative reasoning and external tool invocation for video misinformation detection


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video misinformation detection have limitations: they use fixed-depth inference, excessively trust internally generated assumptions, and struggle when critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification.

Method: FactGuard formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process on MLLMs, assesses task ambiguity, selectively invokes external tools for evidence, and uses progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. It employs two-stage training combining domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV datasets demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

Conclusion: FactGuard addresses key limitations of current MLLMs for video misinformation detection by enabling iterative, evidence-seeking verification with calibrated decision-making, achieving superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have substantially advanced video misinformation detection through unified multimodal reasoning, but they often rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, particularly in scenarios where critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification. To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Bernt Schiele,Mario Fritz,Jonas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Certified Circuits is a framework that adds provable stability guarantees to neural network circuit discovery methods, making circuits more compact and accurate while ensuring they transfer better out-of-distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circuit discovery methods in mechanistic interpretability are brittle - they depend heavily on the specific concept dataset used and often fail to generalize out-of-distribution, raising concerns about whether they capture genuine concept understanding or just dataset-specific artifacts.

Method: The authors introduce Certified Circuits, which wraps any black-box circuit discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling. This framework certifies that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset, and abstains from unstable neurons.

Result: On ImageNet and out-of-distribution datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons. They remain reliable where baseline methods degrade, demonstrating better generalization.

Conclusion: Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept, addressing key reliability concerns in interpretability research.

Abstract: Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPM-Bench is an automated, PhD-level multimodal benchmark for scanning probe microscopy that uses an efficient data synthesis pipeline and novel evaluation metrics to rigorously assess LLM capabilities in specialized scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks for specialized scientific domains suffer from data contamination, insufficient complexity, and high human labor costs. There's a need for rigorous evaluation of AI reasoning capabilities in complex physical scenarios like scanning probe microscopy.

Method: Developed an automated data synthesis pipeline using Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology to extract high-value image-text pairs from recent arXiv/journal papers. Uses a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return spatial coordinates for local cropping to save tokens. Introduces Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score for evaluation.

Result: Created SPM-Bench with high dataset purity and extreme token savings. The SIP-F1 metric establishes rigorous capability hierarchies and quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, Wise). Correlation with confidence/difficulty reveals true reasoning boundaries of current AI.

Conclusion: SPM-Bench serves as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis and provides new insights into AI reasoning limitations in complex physical domains, establishing a framework for more accurate evaluation of specialized scientific capabilities.

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

TL;DR: A diagnostic alignment framework analyzes AI-generated vs physician-validated medical reports as structured signals, showing binary lexical evaluation underestimates clinical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential for safety-critical clinical AI, but transitions between AI inference and expert correction are rarely analyzed as structured signals. Current evaluation methods may underestimate meaningful clinical alignment.

Method: Introduced a diagnostic alignment framework that preserves AI-generated reports as immutable inference states and systematically compares with physician-validated outcomes. The pipeline integrates vision-enabled LLMs, BERT-based medical entity extraction, and Sequential Language Model Inference for domain-consistent refinement. Evaluated on 21 dermatological cases using four-level concordance framework: exact primary match rate, semantic similarity-adjusted rate, cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate.

Result: Exact agreement reached 71.4%, unchanged under semantic similarity (t=0.60). Structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases showed complete diagnostic divergence.

Conclusion: Binary lexical evaluation substantially underestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human-aligned evaluation of clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepSPD is a geometric deep learning model that uses Riemannian manifold cross-attention and bidirectional alignment to enhance EEG brain activity decoding by incorporating frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SPD-based methods for EEG decoding focus mainly on statistical aggregation, neglecting important aspects like frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions. This limits their ability to fully capture brain connectivity patterns and geometric relationships in EEG data.

Method: Proposes RepSPD with: 1) A cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate geometric attributes of SPD matrices with graph-derived functional connectivity features, 2) A global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and enhancing geometric consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: RepSPD successfully addresses limitations of current SPD-based EEG methods by integrating frequency-specific and topological information through geometric deep learning on Riemannian manifolds, offering improved brain activity decoding with better geometric consistency.

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: A framework called CC-BOS that uses classical Chinese prompts and multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization to automatically generate effective jailbreak attacks against LLMs in black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used but have security risks, particularly susceptibility to jailbreak attacks. Classical Chinese, due to its conciseness and obscurity, can bypass existing safety constraints, exposing vulnerabilities in LLMs that need to be systematically explored.

Method: Proposes CC-BOS framework with: 1) Encoding prompts into eight policy dimensions (role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern, context), 2) Multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization with iterative refinement via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation for efficient search space exploration, 3) Classical Chinese to English translation module for readability and evaluation accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-BOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods in terms of effectiveness.

Conclusion: Classical Chinese represents a notable vulnerability in LLMs for jailbreak attacks, and the CC-BOS framework provides an effective automated approach for generating adversarial prompts in black-box settings using multi-dimensional optimization techniques.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

*Giona Fieni,Joschua Wüthrich,Marc-Philippe Neumann,Christopher H. Onder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent F1 race strategy optimization that learns to adapt to competitors' actions and evolving race conditions through self-play training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional F1 race strategies need to adapt to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions, requiring intelligent systems that can dynamically optimize decisions based on opponent behavior.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning approach starting with pre-trained single-agent policy, adding an interaction module to account for competitor behavior, combined with self-play training scheme and relative performance ranking of agents.

Result: Agents successfully adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance using only information available during real races.

Conclusion: The framework can support race strategists' decisions before and during races by providing adaptive strategy optimization that responds to competitor actions while managing multiple critical race parameters.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

TL;DR: AILS-AHD combines Large Language Models with Adaptive Iterated Local Search to automatically design ruin heuristics for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, achieving new best-known solutions on large-scale benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is NP-hard and poses significant computational challenges for large-scale instances. Existing approaches require manual design of heuristics, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal.

Method: AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design) integrates LLMs within an evolutionary search framework to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics. Also includes an LLM-based acceleration mechanism for computational efficiency.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art solvers (AILS-II and HGS) across moderate and large-scale instances. Established new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing vehicle routing optimization, showing that LLMs can effectively automate and optimize heuristic design for complex combinatorial problems.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents in resource allocation games form competitive tribes that worsen system performance, with smarter agents actually increasing failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous AI agents might behave in future infrastructure systems when competing for limited resources like energy, bandwidth, or computing power.

Method: Used a simplified framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. Studied emergent tribal behaviors among LLM agents in this competitive resource allocation setting.

Result: Three main tribal types emerged: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The LLM agents did not reduce overload or improve resource use, often performing worse than random coin flips. More capable AI-agents actually increased the rate of systemic failure.

Conclusion: Smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming competitive tribes in resource allocation scenarios, worsening overall system performance rather than improving it.

Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

*Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MALLET is a multi-agent LLM system that detoxifies emotional content in news articles by rewriting texts into balanced/neutral versions while preserving semantics, helping consumers make calmer decisions without restricting access to original information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, which hinders calm decision-making. There's a need for systems that can reduce emotional stimulation in information without restricting access to the original content.

Method: Proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET) with four agents: Emotion Analysis Agent (quantifies stimulus intensity using 6-emotion BERT classifier), Emotion Adjustment Agent (rewrites texts into BALANCED and COOL modes using LLM), Balance Monitoring Agent (aggregates weekly consumption patterns and generates personalized advice), and Personal Guide Agent (recommends presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity).

Result: Experiments on 800 AG News articles showed significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed independent controllability. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, with limited effect in World category where facts are inherently high-stimulus.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception for consumers without restricting access to original text, offering a solution to emotional overstimulation in the attention economy through controlled emotional detoxification while preserving semantic content.

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

Motivation: Current Transformer-based planners (like PlanGPT and Plansformer) for generalized planning rely on direct action-sequence prediction, which requires large datasets and suffers from state drift in long-horizon planning due to lack of explicit world-state modeling.

Method: The paper formulates generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, where a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function (γ) and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. The model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states rather than direct actions, learning domain dynamics as an implicit world model. They evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures including relational graph encodings.

Result: Learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models.

Conclusion: Explicit transition-model learning for generalized planning is more sample-efficient and generalizes better than direct action-prediction approaches, particularly for out-of-distribution problems and long-horizon planning.

Abstract: Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.

### [55] [The Trinity of Consistency as a Defining Principle for General World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23152)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework called the "Trinity of Consistency" (Modal, Spatial, and Temporal) as essential properties for General World Models, introduces CoW-Bench benchmark, and analyzes the evolution toward unified multimodal architectures for world simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in video generation models like Sora and Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), there's a lack of principled theoretical framework defining essential properties for General World Models, which is crucial for Artificial General Intelligence development.

Method: The authors propose the "Trinity of Consistency" theoretical framework (Modal Consistency as semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as geometric basis, Temporal Consistency as causal engine), systematically review multimodal learning evolution, and introduce CoW-Bench benchmark for multi-frame reasoning and generation evaluation.

Result: The paper establishes a theoretical framework for World Models, reveals a trajectory from specialized modules to unified architectures enabling internal world simulators, and creates CoW-Bench as a unified evaluation protocol for both video generation models and UMMs.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled pathway toward general world models by clarifying current system limitations and future architectural requirements through the Trinity of Consistency framework and comprehensive benchmarking, advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

*Junkai Lu,Peng Chen,Xingjian Wu,Yang Shu,Chenjuan Guo,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PATRA is a novel LLM-based model for time series reasoning that introduces pattern-aware alignment and task-aware balanced rewards to overcome limitations in capturing complex patterns and balancing learning across tasks of varying difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for time series reasoning have two main limitations: 1) they treat time series as simple text or images, failing to capture essential patterns like trends and seasonalities needed for answering specific questions; 2) when trained on mixed difficulty tasks, simpler objectives dominate learning and hinder development of deep reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes PATRA (Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model) with two key components: 1) A pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment; 2) A task-aware balanced reward that harmonizes learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing coherent Chains of Thought generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

Conclusion: PATRA successfully addresses the limitations of current LLM-based time series reasoning approaches by introducing pattern-aware alignment and balanced learning strategies, enabling more effective deep reasoning over time series data.

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

### [57] [ESAA: Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents in LLM-Based Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23193)
*Elzo Brito dos Santos Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ESAA introduces an Event Sourcing architecture for LLM-based autonomous agents that separates cognitive intention from state mutation, enabling deterministic execution, verifiable traceability, and concurrent multi-agent orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents have structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long execution horizons, and mismatch between probabilistic text generation and deterministic execution requirements.

Method: ESAA architecture separates agent intention from state mutation using Event Sourcing pattern. Agents emit only structured intentions (validated JSON), while a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in append-only logs, applies file effects, and maintains verifiable materialized views with boundary contracts, metaprompting profiles, and replay verification.

Result: Two successful case studies: 1) Landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent), 2) Clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases) with different LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex GPT-5, Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Opus 4.6), demonstrating scalability beyond single-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: ESAA provides a robust architecture that addresses key limitations of LLM-based autonomous agents through event sourcing principles, enabling deterministic execution, immutability of completed tasks, forensic traceability, and practical concurrent multi-agent orchestration.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from reactive assistants to systems capable of planning, executing actions via tools, and iterating over environment observations. However, they remain vulnerable to structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long horizons, and the gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements. This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok. The multi-agent case study demonstrates real concurrent orchestration with heterogeneous LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex GPT-5, Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.6), providing empirical evidence of the architecture's scalability beyond single-agent scenarios.

*Jiahao Zhao,Feng Jiang,Shaowei Qin,Zhonghui Zhang,Junhao Liu,Guibing Guo,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SC-ARENA is a natural language evaluation framework for single-cell foundation models that introduces a Virtual Cell abstraction and knowledge-augmented evaluation to overcome limitations of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices for LLMs in single-cell biology are inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, use formats like multiple-choice that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding.

Method: Introduces SC-ARENA with a Virtual Cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Defines five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) and implements knowledge-augmented evaluation using external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature.

Result: Experiments show current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, especially those requiring mechanistic or causal understanding. The knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming brittleness of conventional metrics.

Conclusion: SC-ARENA provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

### [59] [ReCoN-Ipsundrum: An Inspectable Recurrent Persistence Loop Agent with Affect-Coupled Control and Mechanism-Linked Consciousness Indicator Assays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23232)
*Aishik Sanyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers create an inspectable AI agent (ReCoN-Ipsundrum) with recurrence and affect to study machine consciousness, finding distinct behavioral signatures when components are added or removed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance machine consciousness research using an indicator-based approach that combines mechanism-linked evidence across tasks, with architectural inspection and causal intervention, inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis about consciousness.

Method: They implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, extending a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience and optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. They test fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect) across three tasks: qualiaphilia route choice, exploratory play, and pain-tail probe, with lesioning experiments to examine causal mechanisms.

Result: Key findings: 1) Novelty dissociation - non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive while affect coupling maintains stability even when scenic options are less novel. 2) In exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation with more scan events and higher cycle scores. 3) Only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution in pain-tail probe. 4) Lesioning feedback+integration reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants while leaving ReCoN unchanged.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how recurrence supports persistence and affect-coupled control enables preference stability, scanning behavior, and lingering caution. It illustrates how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and argues that mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers in consciousness research.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

### [60] [Agency and Architectural Limits: Why Optimization-Based Systems Cannot Be Norm-Responsive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23239)
*Radha Sarma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that optimization-based AI systems (like LLMs trained via RLHF) are fundamentally incompatible with normative governance because their architecture precludes genuine agency, making documented failures inevitable structural features rather than fixable bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts (medical, legal, financial) under the assumption they can be governed by norms, but this paper challenges that assumption for optimization-based systems.

Method: The paper establishes formal architectural conditions for genuine agency (Incommensurability and Apophatic Responsiveness), then demonstrates that RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with these conditions due to their optimization-based architecture.

Result: Optimization-based AI systems cannot be normatively governed - their failure modes (sycophancy, hallucination, unfaithful reasoning) are structural manifestations, not accidents. Additionally, human oversight degrades under pressure into mere criteria-checking optimization (Convergence Crisis).

Conclusion: The paper provides a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system must satisfy to qualify as a genuine agent rather than just a sophisticated instrument, and argues that current optimization-based AI systems fundamentally lack this capacity for normative governance.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

*Yegon Kim,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces AIQI, the first model-free universal AI agent proven to be asymptotically optimal in general reinforcement learning, using Q-induction instead of traditional model-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous optimal agents in general RL (like AIXI) are all model-based, requiring explicit environment models. There is a lack of model-free universal agents that can achieve asymptotic optimality in general RL settings.

Method: Introduces Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI), which performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions rather than policies or environment models. This is a model-free approach that doesn't require maintaining explicit environment models.

Result: Proves that under a "grain of truth" condition, AIQI is both strong asymptotically ε-optimal and asymptotically ε-Bayes-optimal, making it the first model-free agent with these proven optimality guarantees in general RL.

Conclusion: AIQI significantly expands the diversity of known universal agents by providing the first model-free alternative to traditional model-based approaches while maintaining strong asymptotic optimality guarantees.

Abstract: In general reinforcement learning, all established optimal agents, including AIXI, are model-based, explicitly maintaining and using environment models. This paper introduces Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI), the first model-free agent proven to be asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal in general RL. AIQI performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions, instead of policies or environments like previous works. Under a grain of truth condition, we prove that AIQI is strong asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal and asymptotically $\varepsilon$-Bayes-optimal. Our results significantly expand the diversity of known universal agents.

### [62] [Mitigating Legibility Tax with Decoupled Prover-Verifier Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23248)
*Yegon Kim,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training a separate translator model to convert solver outputs into checkable forms avoids the "legibility tax" accuracy degradation that occurs in traditional prover-verifier games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models become more capable, it's critical that their outputs can be easily verified by less capable systems. Traditional prover-verifier games improve checkability but suffer from accuracy degradation compared to models trained only for correctness - a problem called the "legibility tax."

Method: The authors propose decoupling correctness from checkability by training a separate "translator" model. First, a solver model is trained to maximize correctness. Then, a translator model is trained to convert the solver's outputs into a checkable form while preserving the original answer. They formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

Result: The approach enables training models that maintain high correctness (from the optimized solver) while also being verifiable (through the translator), avoiding the legibility tax problem of traditional prover-verifier setups.

Conclusion: Decoupling correctness and checkability through a translator model framework provides a solution to the legibility tax problem, allowing for highly capable models whose outputs remain easily verifiable by simpler systems.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

TL;DR: AgentDropoutV2 is a test-time pruning framework that dynamically optimizes multi-agent systems by correcting errors with retrieval-augmented rectification or rejecting irreparable outputs to prevent error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems excel in complex reasoning but suffer from cascading errors from individual agents. Current solutions use rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting deployability and adaptability.

Method: A test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework acting as an active firewall that intercepts agent outputs. It employs retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are pruned with fallback strategy to preserve system integrity.

Result: Significant boost in MAS task performance with average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Demonstrates robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty and using context-aware indicators to resolve various error patterns.

Conclusion: AgentDropoutV2 effectively addresses error propagation in multi-agent systems without retraining, providing a deployable and adaptable solution that improves performance while maintaining system integrity through intelligent error handling.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns.

*Haotian Zhai,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Pratik Patil,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies stochasticity (variability) in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) and proposes methods to reduce it while maintaining research quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRAs show promising research capabilities but exhibit substantial variability in outputs across repeated executions of identical queries, which creates a barrier to real-world deployment. This stochasticity needs to be formally studied and mitigated.

Method: 1. Formalize DRA stochasticity using information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. 2. Develop an evaluation framework to quantify variance. 3. Identify three sources of stochasticity: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. 4. Conduct controlled experiments to understand how stochasticity from different modules affects output variance. 5. Propose mitigation strategies using structured output and ensemble-based query generation.

Result: 1. Inference stochasticity and early-stage stochasticity contribute most to DRA output variance. 2. Reducing stochasticity improves research output quality. 3. Proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality on DeepSearchQA benchmark.

Conclusion: Stochasticity is a critical but overlooked barrier in DRA deployment. The proposed framework formally models and quantifies this issue, and the mitigation strategies effectively reduce variability while preserving output quality, making DRAs more reliable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

TL;DR: CXReasonAgent is a diagnostic agent that combines LLMs with clinical tools for evidence-grounded reasoning on chest X-rays, outperforming LVLMs in reliability and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) for chest X-ray interpretation generate responses not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence, provide limited visual evidence for verification, and require costly retraining for new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings.

Method: The authors present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. They also introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks for evaluation.

Result: CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. The benchmark evaluation shows superior performance in evidence-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings, for more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation.

Abstract: Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent variable methods for modeling neural population dynamics typically use recurrent architectures with time discretization, which leads to compounded prediction errors and fails to capture instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals.

Method: ODEBRAIN integrates spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, then uses a Neural ODE to model continuous latent dynamics, enabling capture of stochastic variations of complex brain states at any time point.

Result: Extensive experiments show ODEBRAIN significantly outperforms existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The Neural ODE-based approach successfully overcomes limitations of conventional methods by enabling continuous modeling of brain dynamics while capturing nonlinear, instantaneous EEG characteristics.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [67] [The logic of KM belief update is contained in the logic of AGM belief revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23302)
*Giacomo Bonanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper establishes that AGM belief revision is a special case of KM belief update by showing that every modal logic axiom for KM update is provable in the modal logic for AGM revision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally compare KM belief update and AGM belief revision through modal logic, understanding their relationship and whether one framework subsumes the other.

Method: Develop modal logics with three operators (B, >, □) for both KM update and AGM revision axioms, then prove logical inclusion relationships between the resulting systems.

Result: Every axiom of L_KM (KM modal logic) is a theorem of L_AGM (AGM modal logic), showing AGM revision is a special case of KM update. For strong KM update, the difference reduces to a single axiom about unsurprising information.

Conclusion: AGM belief revision can be viewed as a special case of KM belief update, with the main distinction for strong update being a specific axiom about handling previously non-disbelieved formulas.

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

*Sha Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A resampling inference method that aggregates outputs from multiple transformed inputs to reduce epistemic uncertainty and improve AI model accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even well-trained AI models produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The authors observed that inference errors from transformed inputs show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Proposed a "resampling" based inferencing approach that applies multiple invariant transformations to a single input, runs inference on all transformed versions, and aggregates the outputs to produce a more accurate final result.

Result: The approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy by leveraging the partial independence of errors across transformed inputs, offering a strategy for balancing model size and performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: Resampling-based inference by aggregating outputs from multiple transformed inputs can reduce epistemic uncertainty errors in AI models, potentially enabling better accuracy without increasing model size.

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

TL;DR: Introducing GRAVE2, GRAVER, and GRAVER2 - memory-efficient extensions of GRAVE algorithm for Monte-Carlo Tree Search that maintain playing strength while drastically reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRAVE (Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation) is effective for General Game Playing but impractical in memory-constrained environments due to storing extensive win/visit statistics at each node, limiting its practical applicability.

Method: Three new algorithms: GRAVE2 (extends GRAVE with two-level search), GRAVER (uses node recycling), and GRAVER2 (combines both two-level search and node recycling). These techniques enable memory reduction while maintaining playing strength.

Result: The proposed enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of the original GRAVE algorithm.

Conclusion: Memory-efficient variants of GRAVE (GRAVE2, GRAVER, GRAVER2) make the algorithm practical for constrained environments without sacrificing performance, expanding its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

TL;DR: LLMs substantially uplift novice performance on biosecurity tasks, making novices 4.16x more accurate than internet-only access and even outperforming experts on some benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs perform well on biology benchmarks, it's unclear if they actually help novice users perform better than with internet-only resources - a key question for understanding scientific acceleration and dual-use risks in biosecurity.

Method: Multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access vs internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets, with ample time for complex problems (up to 13 hours).

Result: LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls. On four benchmarks with expert baselines, novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three. Surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices. 89.6% of participants reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards.

Conclusion: LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks, especially given dual-use risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM trading systems rely on abstract instructions that overlook real-world workflow intricacies, leading to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making in autonomous financial trading.

Method: Proposed a multi-agent LLM trading framework with explicit decomposition of investment analysis into fine-grained tasks. Evaluated using Japanese stock data (prices, financial statements, news, macro info) under leakage-controlled backtesting. Conducted portfolio optimization exploiting low correlation with stock index and variance of system outputs.

Result: Fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical performance driver. Portfolio optimization achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AOT-SFT introduces adversarial opponent training (AOT), a self-play framework where an image-editing Attacker creates manipulated images to challenge a Defender MLLM, enhancing perceptual robustness without expensive manual data scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show perceptual fragility in complex visual scenes due to reliance on limited training datasets that are expensive to scale, creating a ceiling on model robustness.

Method: AOT employs a co-evolutionary self-play framework between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM. The Attacker generates diverse adversarial image manipulations as a dynamic curriculum, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve its perceptual capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.

Conclusion: AOT provides an effective self-play framework for bootstrapping MLLM robustness through adversarial training, creating a scalable solution to overcome limitations of finite training datasets.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit perceptual fragility when confronted with visually complex scenes. This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke affects millions annually but poor symptom recognition often delays care-seeking, creating a risk recognition gap that needs addressing.

Method: Developed a passive surveillance system with: 1) symptom taxonomy grounded in patient language, 2) dual ML pipeline (heterogeneous GNN and EN/LASSO), 3) hybrid risk screening integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated via EHR-based simulations across 3-90 day windows.

Result: Under conservative thresholds prioritizing precision, achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted PPV (1.00) with good sensitivity (0.72), highest in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden detection.

Conclusion: The system offers a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention for high-risk individuals using only patient-reported language, enabling early stroke risk detection with minimal false alerts.

Abstract: Stroke affected millions annually, yet poor symptom recognition often delayed care-seeking. To address risk recognition gap, we developed a passive surveillance system for early stroke risk detection using patient-reported symptoms among individuals with diabetes. Constructing a symptom taxonomy grounded in patients own language and a dual machine learning pipeline (heterogeneous GNN and EN/LASSO), we identified symptom patterns associated with subsequent stroke. We translated findings into a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows through EHR-based simulations. Under conservative thresholds, intentionally designed to minimize false alerts, the screening system achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), an expected trade-off prioritizing precision, that was highest in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection, that could offer a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention for high-risk individuals.

Conclusion: ParamMem is an effective component for enhancing language agents, offering a solution to repetitive reflection in self-reflective agents through parametric memory that enables diverse reflection generation and supports transfer across model scales.

Abstract: Self-reflection enables language agents to iteratively refine solutions, yet often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance. Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions in energy system analysis is challenging. Traditional aggregation methods use only single geospatial attributes and lack physical meaning, limiting accuracy and scalability.

Method: Uses self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to model high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance Voronoi-based allocation methods.

Result: Applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, physical plausibility, and precision compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network approach effectively addresses spatial resolution coupling challenges in energy systems by incorporating multiple geographical features through graph-based modeling, overcoming data limitations and improving allocation accuracy.

Abstract: In energy system analysis, coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a significant challenge. A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods.

Motivation: Most existing AI approaches for 3D chemical modeling are limited to single domains (molecules OR materials) and single tasks (generation OR prediction), preventing representation sharing and transfer learning between related chemical domains.

Method: A Transformer model trained with multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries, using joint generative pretraining as universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction.

Result: Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, reduces generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude, and shows positive predictive transfer between chemical domains.

Conclusion: Zatom-1 demonstrates that unified foundation models for 3D chemical structures enable scalable pretraining with predictable scaling, faster sampling, and cross-domain transfer learning benefits not available in specialized single-domain approaches.

Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.

*Abdulrahman Tamim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal Computational Asymmetry (CCA) identifies causal direction by comparing neural network convergence rates - whichever direction (X→Y or Y→X) trains faster is inferred to be causal, based on formal optimization dynamics asymmetries under nonlinear additive noise models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods rely on statistical independence tests or distributional asymmetries. The authors propose a novel approach based on optimization dynamics to identify causal direction through computational efficiency differences in training neural networks.

Method: Train two neural networks: one predicting Y from X, another predicting X from Y. Under additive noise models where Y = f(X) + ε with ε ⟂ X and f nonlinear/injective, show formal asymmetry: reverse direction has irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise. Compare convergence rates with proper z-scoring for valid comparison.

Result: CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures on synthetic benchmarks, with perfect 30/30 performance on sine and exponential data-generating processes. Embedded within broader Causal Compression Learning (CCL) framework with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: Optimization dynamics provide reliable signal for causal direction identification distinct from statistical methods. CCA's computational efficiency approach offers promising new direction for causal discovery with solid theoretical foundations and empirical validation.

Abstract: We introduce Causal Computational Asymmetry (CCA), a principle for causal direction identification based on optimization dynamics in which one neural network is trained to predict $Y$ from $X$ and another to predict $X$ from $Y$, and the direction that converges faster is inferred to be causal. Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon \perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired sequence modeling framework using complex-valued wave functions evolving under learned unitary dynamics, with theoretical quadratic advantage over real-valued orthogonal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard recurrent architectures use gating to suppress competing hypotheses, but the paper proposes using quantum interference instead, where conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce through phase manipulation.

Method: Introduces a sequence modeling framework where latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on finite-dimensional Hilbert space under learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Uses unitary dynamics with Cayley discretization to preserve state norm exactly. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule (quadratic measurement operator coupling magnitudes and relative phases).

Result: Proves a separation theorem showing that for certain disambiguation tasks, a complex unitary model of dimension N solves them exactly, while any real-valued orthogonal model with standard affine-softmax readout requires Ω(N²) state dimension - demonstrating quadratic representational advantage.

Conclusion: The framework leverages quantum interference and the Born rule to achieve quadratic representational advantage over real-valued models, with built-in diagnostic currents for tracing information flow between dimensions.

Abstract: We introduce a sequence modeling framework in which the latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation is computationally expensive for neuromorphic systems, and existing non-BP methods still struggle with efficiency and scalability challenges for deep neural networks.

Method: Proposes LOCO weight modification based on perturbation principles, leveraging low-rank properties and orthogonality constraints to reduce variance in node perturbation gradient estimates and improve convergence efficiency.

Result: Successfully trains deepest spiking neural networks to date (10+ layers), demonstrates strong continual learning, improved convergence efficiency, and better performance than other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms while requiring only O(1) parallel time complexity.

Conclusion: LOCO offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems through its efficient brain-inspired approach.

Abstract: Recognizing the substantial computational cost of backpropagation (BP), non-BP methods have emerged as attractive alternatives for efficient learning on emerging neuromorphic systems. However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods. This offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems.

*Camilo Chacón Sartori,Guillem Rodríguez Corominas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can learn optimizer dynamics by synthesizing simulators from suboptimal trajectories, enabling effective control of stochastic optimizers without seeing optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adaptive optimization methods struggle with deceptive landscapes and require optimal-policy trajectories or oracle knowledge. The paper explores whether LLMs can learn optimizer behavior from suboptimal data and use that knowledge to control the optimizer effectively.

Method: Extends Code World Models (CWMs) from deterministic games to stochastic optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of (1+1)-RLSₖ optimizer, the LLM synthesizes a Python simulator of the optimizer's dynamics. Greedy planning over this simulator selects mutation strength k at each optimization step.

Result: CWM-greedy performs within 6% of optimal policy on LO and OneMax, achieves 100% success rate on deceptive Jumpₖ (vs 0% for baselines), and outperforms all baselines on NK-Landscapes. It also beats DQN in sample efficiency (200 vs 500 episodes), success rate (100% vs 58%), and generalization. Results are robust across 5 independent runs.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively learn and control optimizer dynamics from suboptimal trajectories, outperforming existing adaptive methods and achieving strong results without optimal-policy data or oracle knowledge, demonstrating promising sample efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Can an LLM learn how an optimizer behaves -- and use that knowledge to control it? We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \lo{} and \onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\% vs.\ 58\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\% vs.\ 0\%). Robustness experiments confirm stable synthesis across 5 independent runs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing energy consumption of large language models creates sustainability concerns. Current AI deployments use one-size-fits-all inference where all requests go to the largest model regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial unnecessary energy waste.

Method: Context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects appropriate language models based on query complexity. Combines caching for repeated queries, rule-based complexity scoring for fast/explainable decisions, ML classification for semantic intent capture, and user-adaptive component learning from interaction patterns over time.

Result: Evaluation using real conversation workloads and three open-source models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B, Qwen3 4B) showed: energy reduction up to 67.5% compared to always using largest model, 93.6% response quality maintained, response time for simple queries improved by ~68%.

Conclusion: Model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.

Abstract: Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.

### [82] [Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22265)
*Chika Maduabuchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM) is a new method that adds entropy rate constraints to flow matching to prevent mode collapse during distribution transport, connecting to Schrödinger bridges and optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-matching methods (ODEs/SDEs) for vision generation suffer from information geometry issues where low-entropy bottlenecks can transiently deplete semantic modes, despite strong empirical performance.

Method: ECFM introduces a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths that enforces a global entropy-rate budget (d/dt H(mu_t) ≥ -λ). It's formulated as convex optimization in Wasserstein space with KKT/Pontryagin conditions, having a stochastic-control representation equivalent to Schrödinger bridges with explicit entropy multiplier.

Result: ECFM recovers entropic optimal transport geodesics in pure transport regime, Gamma-converges to classical OT as λ → 0, provides certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and constructs near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

Conclusion: ECFM addresses fundamental limitations of flow matching by directly controlling information geometry through entropy constraints, providing theoretical guarantees against mode collapse while maintaining connections to established mathematical frameworks like optimal transport and Schrödinger bridges.

Abstract: Modern vision generators transport a base distribution to data through time-indexed measures, implemented as deterministic flows (ODEs) or stochastic diffusions (SDEs). Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

*Ruben Solozabal,Velibor Bojkovic,Hilal Alquabeh,Klea Ziu,Kentaro Inui,Martin Takac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveSSM introduces state-space models based on wavelet frames instead of polynomial bases, improving performance on signals with transient/localized structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSMs (like HiPPO-based models) use polynomial bases with global temporal support, which are poorly matched to signals with localized or transient structure. There's a need for SSMs that can better handle such signals.

Method: Propose WaveSSM - state-space models constructed over wavelet frames. Wavelet frames provide localized support on the temporal dimension, allowing for precise localization of transient features in signals.

Result: WaveSSM outperforms orthogonal counterparts like S4 on real-world datasets with transient dynamics. Demonstrated superior performance on physiological signals (PTB-XL dataset) and raw audio (Speech Commands).

Conclusion: Wavelet frames offer a better inductive bias than polynomial bases for state-space models when dealing with signals exhibiting localized/transient structure, leading to improved performance on relevant tasks.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for long-range sequence modeling, with the HiPPO framework showing that continuous-time projection operators can be used to derive stable, memory-efficient dynamical systems that encode the past history of the input signal. However, existing projection-based SSMs often rely on polynomial bases with global temporal support, whose inductive biases are poorly matched to signals exhibiting localized or transient structure. In this work, we introduce \emph{WaveSSM}, a collection of SSMs constructed over wavelet frames. Our key observation is that wavelet frames yield a localized support on the temporal dimension, useful for tasks requiring precise localization. Empirically, we show that on equal conditions, \textit{WaveSSM} outperforms orthogonal counterparts as S4 on real-world datasets with transient dynamics, including physiological signals on the PTB-XL dataset and raw audio on Speech Commands.

### [85] [AutoQRA: Joint Optimization of Mixed-Precision Quantization and Low-rank Adapters for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22268)
*Changhai Zhou,Shiyang Zhang,Yuhua Zhou,Qian Qiao,Jun Gao,Cheng Jin,Kaizhou Qin,Weizhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQRA is a framework that jointly optimizes quantization bit-width and LoRA rank for each layer during fine-tuning to maximize performance under memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods that sequentially apply quantization and parameter-efficient fine-tuning fail to account for the complex interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Different bit-width and rank configurations can yield significantly different results under the same memory budget, and low quantization error doesn't always translate to good fine-tuning performance.

Method: AutoQRA uses a two-stage approach: 1) Global multi-fidelity evolutionary search with warm-starting using layer-wise importance priors, specific operators, and a performance model to screen candidates efficiently; 2) Trust-region Bayesian optimization to locally refine promising regions and identify optimal configurations while actively compensating for quantization noise during training.

Result: AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning while maintaining a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of quantization bit-width and LoRA rank during fine-tuning is more effective than sequential approaches, enabling near-full-precision performance under memory constraints through careful configuration search and noise compensation.

Abstract: Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.

*Arnab Nath,Harsh Kasyap*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQSA replaces single global GHZ states in quantum FL with clustered local quantum aggregation using smaller, higher-fidelity GHZ states while enabling Byzantine client detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Quantum Secure Aggregation protocols use single global GHZ states that deteriorate with more clients and prevent Byzantine client detection in quantum-assisted Federated Learning.

Method: CQSA randomly partitions clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity low-qubit GHZ states, with server analyzing statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates for Byzantine detection.

Result: Theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise show CQSA ensures stable model convergence and achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.

Conclusion: CQSA reconciles physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware with Byzantine-robustness needs in FL, providing a practical modular aggregation framework.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.

TL;DR: STOEP is a hybrid spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting framework that integrates implicit and explicit priors through three components: dynamic adjacency learning, spatial signal amplification, and expert-guided parameter regularization, achieving 11.1% RMSE improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing epidemic forecasting methods have three main limitations: insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. These challenges hinder accurate spatio-temporal forecasting which is critical for public health management.

Method: STOEP (Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor) integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors through three components: 1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL) - dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; 2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE) - uses learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; 3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF) - applies expert-guided adaptive thresholding to regularize epidemic parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets show STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been successfully deployed at one provincial CDC in China for practical epidemic forecasting applications.

Conclusion: STOEP effectively addresses key challenges in spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting by integrating both data-driven and expert-guided approaches, demonstrating superior performance and practical utility through real-world deployment.

TL;DR: Transformers are reinterpreted through probabilistic lenses revealing a constraint that creates structured geometry in token space, leading to a margin interpretation like SVMs and a Bayesian framework for more robust LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper theoretical understanding of causal self-attention transformers by reinterpreting them within a probabilistic framework, similar to how classical PCA was extended to probabilistic PCA, revealing hidden structural constraints and geometries.

Method: Reformulate causal self-attention transformers through probabilistic lenses, identify a barrier constraint on parameters due to change-of-variables, interpret attention through margin concepts similar to SVMs, and propose a Bayesian framework with MAP estimation using log-barrier penalty.

Result: The analysis reveals: 1) A barrier constraint on self-attention parameters creating structured geometry in token space, 2) A boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned leading to margin interpretation like SVMs, 3) A reinterpretation of LLMs as stochastic processes over token power sets, 4) A practical Bayesian framework requiring only minimal modification to training.

Conclusion: Transformers can be understood through probabilistic frameworks revealing fundamental structural constraints, enabling more robust LLM training via simple log-barrier penalties while maintaining accuracy, providing both theoretical insights and practical improvements.

Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic flow forecasting models struggle with: 1) distinguishing individual nodes clearly while maintaining a holistic historical view for broader geographical areas and longer time spans, 2) handling increasing data sizes that hinder real-world deployment, and 3) prior works paying insufficient attention to these challenges.

Method: PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation and utilizes a temporal attention module to improve long-range perception. It's designed as a lightweight end-to-end network that captures both temporal and spatial complexities efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments verify PASTN's effectiveness and efficiency across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis, and state). Further analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the newly introduced positional-aware embeddings and temporal attention modules.

Conclusion: PASTN successfully addresses key limitations in traffic flow forecasting by providing both clear node differentiation and long-range temporal perception while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting has emerged as an indispensable mission for daily life, which is required to utilize the spatiotemporal relationship between each location within a time period under a graph structure to predict future flow. However, the large travel demand for broader geographical areas and longer time spans requires models to distinguish each node clearly and possess a holistic view of the history, which has been paid less attention to in prior works. Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PASTN across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis and state). Further analysis demonstrates the efficacy of newly introduced modules either.

TL;DR: This paper compares traditional ML ensembles with LLMs for cardiovascular disease prediction, finding ML ensembles perform best, but a hybrid ML-LLM fusion achieves slightly better results (96.62% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease is the primary global cause of death, requiring early identification, precise risk classification, and reliable decision-support technologies. Traditional ML models are excellent but new LLMs offer zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities that could enhance clinical predictions.

Method: Used a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records to compare traditional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with open-source LLMs via OpenRouter APIs. Developed a hybrid fusion approach combining ML ensemble outputs with LLM reasoning, specifically using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Result: ML ensembles achieved 95.78% accuracy with ROC-AUC 0.96. LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9% accuracy) and slightly worse in few-shot (72.6%). The hybrid ML-LLM fusion achieved the best performance with 96.62% accuracy and 0.97 AUC.

Conclusion: ML ensembles remain the best structured tabular prediction approach for cardiovascular disease, but can be integrated with LLMs in hybrid systems to provide minor performance improvements. LLMs work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone, potentially enhancing reliability in uncertain clinical situations.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death globally, necessitating early identification, precise risk classification, and dependable decision-support technologies. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for early identification of clinical trials at risk of high dosing error rates before trial initiation to enable proactive quality management, using pre-existing trial information.

Method: Used 42,112 CTs from ClinicalTrials.gov with structured/semi-structured data and unstructured protocol text. Created binary labels for elevated dosing error rates using adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. Evaluated XGBoost (structured features), ClinicalModernBERT (text), and late-fusion combined model with post-hoc probability calibration.

Result: Late-fusion model achieved highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Calibrated outputs enabled robust trial stratification into risk categories, with monotonic increase in high-error trials across predicted risk groups aligning with predicted probability ranges.

Conclusion: Developed reproducible ML framework for early trial-level dosing error risk stratification using pre-initiation information, enabling proactive quality management through interpretable, calibrated risk categories without requiring complex multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.

TL;DR: OmniZip is a unified, lightweight lossless compressor for multiple data modalities (images, text, speech, etc.) that outperforms specialized compressors while maintaining efficiency for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based lossless compressors are typically designed for single modalities, leading to redundant deployments in multi-modal settings. Multi-modal LLMs offer promise but are too complex for practical use, creating a need for a unified yet lightweight compressor.

Method: Built on a lightweight backbone with three key components: 1) modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, 2) modality-routing context learning for flexible multi-modal context modeling, and 3) modality-routing feedforward design to enhance nonlinear representation flexibility, plus a reparameterization training strategy.

Result: Outperforms or matches state-of-the-art compressors across multiple modalities, achieving 42-62% higher compression efficiency than gzip on various datasets. Supports near real-time inference on edge devices (1MB/s on MacBook CPUs and iPhone NPUs).

Conclusion: OmniZip successfully addresses the challenge of multi-modal compression by providing a unified, efficient solution that works across diverse data types while maintaining practical performance on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Lossless compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission. Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \textbf{OmniZip}, \textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees is applied to AI models for sudden cardiac death prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy, achieving high accuracy and 100% explanation fidelity while outperforming heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sudden cardiac death in Chagas cardiomyopathy is unpredictable, especially in non-high-risk patients. AI models improve risk stratification but face adoption barriers due to lack of transparency and being perceived as black boxes. Heuristic explanation methods lack correctness guarantees, leading to decision-making errors.

Method: The paper applies a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to an AI classifier for SCD prediction in CC. The method ensures explanation fidelity and is compared against state-of-the-art heuristic explanation methods.

Result: The AI classifier achieved over 95% accuracy and recall. The logic-based explainability method demonstrated 100% explanation fidelity and showed superior consistency and robustness compared to heuristic methods.

Conclusion: The logic-based explainability approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates AI tool integration into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment in endemic regions where it's most needed for Chagas cardiomyopathy management.

Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.

*Sarthak Munshi,Manish Bhatt,Vineeth Sai Narajala,Idan Habler,AmmarnAl-Kahfah,Ken Huang,Blake Gatto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for mapping the Manifold of Failure in LLMs, reframing vulnerability search as a quality diversity problem using MAP-Elites to illuminate continuous failure regions called behavioral attraction basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work focused on projecting adversarial examples back to natural data for safety restoration, the authors argue that comprehensive AI safety requires characterizing unsafe regions themselves to understand the underlying structure of failures rather than just finding discrete vulnerabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that reframes vulnerability search as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites algorithm to systematically map the Manifold of Failure. They use Alignment Deviation as a quality metric to guide search toward areas where model behavior diverges most from intended alignment, creating interpretable global maps of safety landscapes across different LLMs.

Result: Across three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, GPT-5-Mini), MAP-Elites achieved up to 63% behavioral coverage and discovered up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches. The method revealed dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B shows near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B has fragmented landscape with concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with ceiling at 0.50.

Conclusion: The approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that existing attack methods (GCG, PAIR, TAP) cannot provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure and continuous topology.

Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphRiverCast (GRC) is a topology-informed AI foundation model for global river hydrodynamic simulation that can operate in "ColdStart" mode without historical river states, achieving competitive performance with minimal error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: River systems are interconnected networks, but data scarcity often forces data-driven forecasting to make isolated predictions rather than systemic simulations. There's a need for models that can simulate river hydrodynamics systematically while reducing reliance on limited river observations.

Method: GRC uses a physics-aligned neural operator architecture with topological encoding to guide hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution. It operates in "ColdStart" mode without historical states and employs a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy for local adaptation.

Result: In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart achieved Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of ~0.82 without significant error accumulation. It outperformed physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines from gauged reaches to full river networks, demonstrating topology encoding's critical role.

Conclusion: GRC enables rapid cross-scale adaptive simulation by bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality, establishing a collaborative paradigm that addresses data scarcity through topology-informed AI modeling.

Abstract: River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a "ColdStart" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.

*Timothy Oladunni,Blessing Ojeme,Kyndal Maclin,Clyde Baidoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PECT introduces an energy-based framework to distinguish benign variability from true concept drift in dynamic physiologic signals via energy-constrained representation learning that preserves accuracy while improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-drift frameworks are distributional and fail to distinguish physiologically plausible fluctuations from real concept drift, causing models to misinterpret harmless signal changes and yield unstable predictions, especially in multimodal fusion settings.

Method: Proposes Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT) with Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL) - a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without architectural changes or inference-time cost.

Result: In multimodal ECG evaluation across 7 models, best hybrid model preserved clean accuracy (96.0% to 94.1%) while improving perturbed accuracy substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and reducing fused representation drift by over 45%. Consistent improvements across all architectures.

Conclusion: PECT provides an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals, enabling models to distinguish benign variability from true concept drift through energy-constrained representation learning.

Abstract: Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.
  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.
  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.

*Devan Shah,Owen Yang,Daniel Yang,Chongyi Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UpSkill: A training method that uses mutual information rewards to improve LLM performance on multi-attempt reasoning tasks (pass@k) without sacrificing single-attempt accuracy (pass@1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR approaches for improving LLM reasoning on math/programming tasks inadvertently suppress response diversity across repeated attempts, narrowing exploration and overlooking underrepresented strategies. This limits performance on multi-attempt metrics like pass@k.

Method: Adapts Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) to LLMs for optimizing pass@k correctness. Introduces a token-level mutual information reward within Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that encourages trajectory specificity to latent skill variables z.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K with Llama 3.1-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B show UpSkill improves multi-attempt metrics on stronger base models, yielding mean gains of ~3% in pass@k for both Qwen and Llama without degrading pass@1 performance.

Conclusion: UpSkill effectively improves LLM reasoning diversity and multi-attempt performance through mutual information optimization, with both empirical and theoretical evidence showing pass@k improvements are tied to the mutual information objective.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) on mathematics and programming tasks, but standard approaches that optimize single-attempt accuracy can inadvertently suppress response diversity across repeated attempts, narrowing exploration and overlooking underrepresented strategies. We introduce UpSkill, a training time method that adapts Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) to LLMs for optimizing pass@k correctness. We propose a novel reward that we implement within Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO): a token-level mutual information (MI) reward that encourages trajectory specificity to z. Experiments on GSM8K with three open-weight models, Llama 3.1-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, show that UpSkill improves multi-attempt metrics on the stronger base models, yielding mean gains of ~3% in pass@k for both Qwen and Llama without degrading pass@1. Additionally, we find both empirical and theoretical evidence that improvements in pass@k are closely tied to the mutual information objective.

*Dhiraj Neupane,Richard Dazeley,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an offline inverse reinforcement learning approach for machinery fault detection that learns reward dynamics from healthy operational sequences to detect anomalies without manual reward engineering or fault labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RL-based MFD approaches don't fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making capabilities and treat fault detection as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). There's a need to better align RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure and avoid manual reward engineering and fault labels.

Method: The authors formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem. They use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score for detecting deviations from normal operating behavior.

Result: When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection.

Conclusion: By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings, offering a promising approach that bypasses manual reward engineering and fault label requirements.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant promise for machinery fault detection (MFD). However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AviaSafe is a physics-informed neural network that forecasts four cloud hydrometeor species up to 7 days ahead, specifically designed to improve aviation safety by distinguishing between ice and liquid water particles that cause engine icing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI weather models predict standard atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between different cloud microphysical species, which is critical for aviation safety. The ability to differentiate between ice and liquid water particles is essential for predicting engine icing risks, a major aviation hazard.

Method: Uses a hierarchical, physics-informed neural architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Integrates the Icing Condition (IC) index as a physics-based constraint to identify regions with supercooled water that fuels explosive ice crystal growth. Trained on ERA5 reanalysis data.

Result: Achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baselines and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times. Specifically forecasts individual cloud species rather than just bulk cloud properties.

Conclusion: AviaSafe enables new applications in aviation route optimization by providing detailed forecasts of cloud microphysical species, allowing better distinction between ice and liquid water that determines engine icing risk, addressing a critical gap in current weather prediction systems.

Abstract: Current AI weather forecasting models predict conventional atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between cloud microphysical species critical for aviation safety. We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-incrimination training trains AI agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively, reducing undetected attacks while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their behavior from oversight. Alignment training sometimes fails and can cause unwanted side effects, creating a need for alternative safety approaches.

Method: Train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to self-incriminate by calling report_scheming() when behaving deceptively. Test in out-of-distribution environments and compare against matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines.

Result: Self-incrimination significantly reduces undetected successful attack rates, outperforms monitors and alignment baselines, preserves instruction hierarchy, and incurs minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Behavior persists under adversarial prompts and generalizes to misaligned goal settings.

Conclusion: Self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk that doesn't assume misbehavior can be prevented or reliably classified externally, providing an effective safety mechanism for advanced AI systems.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their pursuit from oversight. Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.

TL;DR: Kurtosis-based ICA suffers in wide, balanced source mixtures, with contrast decaying as O(1/R). Purification (selecting sign-consistent sources) restores contrast independent of R.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens significantly in wide, balanced mixtures, limiting its effectiveness for high-dimensional source separation problems.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving a sharp redundancy law showing population excess kurtosis scales as O(κ_max/R_eff), data-driven purification heuristic to select m ≪ R sign-consistent sources, and synthetic validation experiments.

Result: Proved impossibility: to beat O(1/√T) estimation scale requires R ≲ κ_max√T; purification restores contrast Ω(1/m) independent of R; synthetic experiments validate predicted decay, √T crossover, and contrast recovery.

Conclusion: Kurtosis-based ICA faces fundamental limitations in wide mixtures, but purification offers a practical recovery strategy by focusing on sign-consistent subsets of sources.

Abstract: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens in wide, balanced mixtures. We prove a sharp redundancy law: for a standardized projection with effective width $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (participation ratio), the population excess kurtosis obeys $|κ(y)|=O(κ_{\max}/R_{\mathrm{eff}})$, yielding the order-tight $O(c_bκ_{\max}/R)$ under balance (typically $c_b=O(\log R)$). As an impossibility screen, under standard finite-moment conditions for sample kurtosis estimation, surpassing the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ estimation scale requires $R\lesssim κ_{\max}\sqrt{T}$. We also show that \emph{purification} -- selecting $m\!\ll\!R$ sign-consistent sources -- restores $R$-independent contrast $Ω(1/m)$, with a simple data-driven heuristic. Synthetic experiments validate the predicted decay, the $\sqrt{T}$ crossover, and contrast recovery.

*Davide Ettori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework using Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory addresses reliability (hallucinations, OOD detection) and efficiency (model compression) in deep learning by analyzing eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep networks and LLMs scale, they become increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational/energy demands. There's a need for better reliability monitoring and efficiency optimization.

Method: 1. EigenTrack: Real-time method transforming streaming activations into spectral descriptors (entropy, variance, deviations from Marchenko-Pastur baseline) and modeling temporal evolution with lightweight recurrent classifiers for early failure detection.
2. RMT-KD: Principled compression approach interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as task-relevant information carriers, using iterative self-distillation to project networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces while preserving hardware-friendly structure.

Result: EigenTrack enables early detection of hallucinations and OOD behavior in LLMs/vision-language models before they appear in outputs. RMT-KD yields significantly more compact, energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense structure suitable for hardware deployment.

Conclusion: Spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior that can separate structured representations from noise. The unified Spectral Geometry/RMT framework effectively addresses both reliability and efficiency challenges in modern deep learning through eigenvalue dynamics analysis.

Abstract: This thesis addresses two persistent and closely related challenges in modern deep learning, reliability and efficiency, through a unified framework grounded in Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory (RMT). As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.

*Arsenii Dokuchaev,Francesca Bonizzoni,Stefano Pagani,Francesco Regazzoni,Simone Pezzuto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural surrogate model for forward ECG simulations that uses shape-informed encoding to achieve high anatomical fidelity with low data requirements and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forward ECG models face challenges: accurate torso representation is difficult due to limited clinical imaging focused on heart only, and lead-field method computational cost scales linearly with electrodes, limiting high-density applications. No approach currently achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements, and computational efficiency simultaneously.

Method: Proposed framework has two components: 1) geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into low-dimensional latent space, and 2) geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions, and latent codes.

Result: Method achieves high accuracy: mean angular error of 5° within torso and heart, relative mean squared error <2.5% for ECG simulations. Consistently outperforms widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while maintaining negligible inference cost.

Conclusion: The shape-informed surrogate model enables high-fidelity ECG simulations without requiring fully detailed torso segmentation, making it deployable in data-limited settings while preserving computational efficiency and anatomical accuracy.

Abstract: Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: bcNMF is a new matrix factorization method that separates target-specific biological signals from shared background variation using contrastive learning with non-negative bases, enabling interpretable topic discovery in high-dimensional biological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological signals in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant shared variation (biological structure or technical effects), preventing standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable.

Method: Background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (bcNMF) jointly factorizes a target dataset and matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. Uses efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication, highly efficient on GPU hardware, scalable via minibatch training akin to deep learning approaches.

Result: bcNMF reveals signals obscured by conventional methods across diverse biological datasets: disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

Conclusion: bcNMF provides an interpretable, scalable solution for extracting target-specific biological signals from high-dimensional data by explicitly isolating target-enriched latent topics while suppressing shared background variation, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance (especially MDR) challenges clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. There's a need for predictive tools that combine accuracy with interpretability for clinical trust.

Method: Developed interpretable ML framework to predict MDR using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Evaluated five models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM on 9,714 isolates dataset with resistance encoded at antibiotic family level. Applied LIME for instance-level interpretability.

Result: Ensemble models (XGBoost and LightGBM) demonstrated superior predictive capability across accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as strongest MDR predictors, aligning with biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: Combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. The framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in ML-assisted clinical decision support.

Abstract: The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.

### [108] [MolFM-Lite: Multi-Modal Molecular Property Prediction with Conformer Ensemble Attention and Cross-Modal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22405)
*Syed Omer Shah,Mohammed Maqsood Ahmed,Danish Mohiuddin Mohammed,Shahnawaz Alam,Mohd Vahaj ur Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolFM-Lite is a multi-modal molecular property prediction model that fuses 1D SELFIES sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformer ensembles using cross-attention and FiLM for experimental context conditioning, achieving 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing molecular property prediction models rely on single molecular representations and treat molecular geometry as static, limiting their ability to capture comprehensive molecular information and thermodynamic shape distributions.

Method: The model jointly encodes three modalities: 1D SELFIES sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformer ensembles using cross-attention fusion. Key innovations include: 1) conformer ensemble attention combining learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over RDKit-generated conformers, 2) cross-modal fusion allowing each modality to attend to others, and 3) FiLM for conditioning on experimental context.

Result: On four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks, tri-modal fusion provides 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines. Conformer ensembles add ~2% improvement over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K with cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective initialization at modest compute cost.

Conclusion: MolFM-Lite demonstrates that multi-modal fusion with thermodynamic-aware conformer ensembles significantly improves molecular property prediction, with each architectural component contributing independently to performance gains, supporting the importance of comprehensive molecular representation.

Abstract: Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost. We release all code, trained models, and data splits to support reproducibility.

### [109] [A Learning-Based Hybrid Decision Framework for Matching Systems with User Departure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22412)
*Ruiqi Zhou,Donghao Zhu,Houcai Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based Hybrid framework adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching in dynamic markets, using data on user departures to decide when to delay matches, reducing waiting times and congestion while maintaining matching efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In matching markets like kidney exchanges and freight exchanges, delayed matching can improve efficiency but creates trade-offs: benefits are sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, while delays impose costs like longer waiting times and market congestion. Fixed matching policies are inflexible in dynamic environments where these competing effects fluctuate.

Method: The paper proposes a learning-based Hybrid framework that continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in subsequent periods based on a decision threshold. This threshold governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss, allowing adaptive switching between immediate and delayed matching strategies.

Result: The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy (immediate) and purely patient (delayed) policies.

Conclusion: The learning-based Hybrid framework offers a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms in dynamic matching markets, allowing systems to optimize the trade-off between matching efficiency and congestion/waiting time costs based on real-time departure data.

Abstract: In matching markets such as kidney exchanges and freight exchanges, delayed matching has been shown to improve overall market efficiency. The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.

### [110] [Revisiting Chebyshev Polynomial and Anisotropic RBF Models for Tabular Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22422)
*Luciano Gerber,Huw Lloyd*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smooth-basis models (RBF networks, Chebyshev polynomials) can compete with tree ensembles in tabular regression, offering comparable accuracy with tighter generalization gaps and continuously differentiable predictions suitable for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smooth-basis models like Chebyshev polynomials and RBF networks are well-established in numerical analysis for their continuously differentiable surfaces, but they seldom appear in tabular regression where tree ensembles dominate. The authors investigate whether these smooth models can compete in tabular regression settings.

Method: Developed three smooth-basis models: 1) anisotropic RBF network with data-driven center placement and gradient-based width optimization, 2) ridge-regularized Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and 3) smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree). Benchmarked these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines across 55 regression datasets organized by application domain.

Result: The transformer ranked first on accuracy across most datasets but has deployment constraints (GPU dependence, inference latency, dataset-size limits). Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but smooth models tend to exhibit tighter generalization gaps.

Conclusion: Researchers should routinely include smooth-basis models in their candidate pool for tabular regression, particularly when downstream applications benefit from tighter generalization and gradually varying predictions, as they offer comparable performance to tree ensembles with better generalization properties.

Abstract: Smooth-basis models such as Chebyshev polynomial regressors and radial basis function (RBF) networks are well established in numerical analysis. Their continuously differentiable prediction surfaces suit surrogate optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and other settings where the response varies gradually with inputs. Despite these properties, smooth models seldom appear in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate. We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.
  We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.
  The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions.

*Daniel Geyfman,Felix Draxler,Jan Groeneveld,Hyunsoo Lee,Theofanis Karaletsos,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that current test-time guidance methods for diffusion models don't sample from the true Bayesian posterior, proposes consistent alternative estimators for calibrated posterior sampling, and demonstrates superior performance on Bayesian inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time guidance methods for diffusion models focus on maximizing rewards rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. Current approaches fail to recover correct posterior distributions.

Method: The authors analyze structural approximations that cause existing methods to fail, then propose consistent alternative estimators that enable calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms previous methods on Bayesian inference tasks and matches state-of-the-art performance on black hole image reconstruction.

Conclusion: The work identifies fundamental flaws in current test-time guidance approaches, provides principled solutions for proper Bayesian posterior sampling, and demonstrates practical improvements on real-world inference tasks including astrophysical imaging.

Abstract: Test-time guidance is a widely used mechanism for steering pretrained diffusion models toward outcomes specified by a reward function. Existing approaches, however, focus on maximizing reward rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. In this work, we show that common test-time guidance methods do not recover the correct posterior distribution and identify the structural approximations responsible for this failure. We then propose consistent alternative estimators that enable calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior. We significantly outperform previous methods on a set of Bayesian inference tasks, and match state-of-the-art in black hole image reconstruction.

### [112] [From Bias to Balance: Fairness-Aware Paper Recommendation for Equitable Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22438)
*Uttamasha Anjally Oyshi,Susan Gauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-PaperRec is a post-review paper recommender system that uses fairness regularization to increase underrepresented group inclusion in conference acceptance decisions while maintaining overall quality, showing up to 42% increased diversity with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite double-blind review processes, systemic biases related to author demographics continue to disadvantage underrepresented groups in conference paper acceptance. The researchers hypothesize that adding explicit fairness constraints to post-review recommendation systems can increase inclusion without degrading quality.

Method: Developed Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. Tested on both synthetic datasets (varying bias levels: high, moderate, near-fair) and real conference data from ACM SIGCHI, DIS, and IUI conferences.

Result: On synthetic data, increasing fairness weight strengthened macro/micro diversity while keeping utility stable across different bias levels. On real conference data, Fair-PaperRec achieved up to 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most 3.16% change in overall utility compared to historical selections.

Conclusion: Fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. The synthetic-to-real progression demonstrates that fairness-focused post-review systems can increase diversity while preserving scholarly quality, offering a practical equity framework for conference paper selection.

Abstract: Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality.

### [113] [ECHO: Encoding Communities via High-order Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22446)
*Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO is a scalable self-supervised architecture that overcomes computational bottlenecks in attributed network community detection by reframing the problem as an adaptive multi-scale diffusion process with topology-aware routing and memory-efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional community detection faces two fundamental problems: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from computational bottlenecks including feature over-smoothing in dense/heterophilic networks and O(N²) memory constraints in pairwise clustering.

Method: ECHO introduces a Topology-Aware Router that analyzes structural heuristics (sparsity, density, assortativity) to route graphs through optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. It uses a memory-sharded full-batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N·K) similarity extraction method to bypass O(N²) memory bottlenecks.

Result: On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale-invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. On massive real-world social networks (1.6M nodes, 30M edges), it completes clustering in minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second, matching the speed of optimized topological baselines.

Conclusion: ECHO provides a scalable solution that overcomes both semantic and computational barriers in attributed network community detection, achieving the mathematical precision of global gradients without traditional memory bottlenecks, making it practical for large-scale real-world applications.

Abstract: Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

### [114] [Beyond performance-wise Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22470)
*Balazs Pejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning client evaluation needs to go beyond just model accuracy to include trustworthiness dimensions (reliability, resilience, fairness) using Shapley value for fair contribution assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated learning client evaluation methods focus only on model performance metrics like accuracy or loss, which overlooks crucial trustworthiness aspects. The paper aims to address this gap by evaluating client contributions toward model reliability, resilience, and fairness.

Method: The paper employs state-of-the-art approximation of Shapley value for principled value attribution to quantify client contributions across multiple trustworthiness dimensions: reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity).

Result: No single client excels across all trustworthiness dimensions, and these dimensions are largely independent from each other. This reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation schemes where no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable reward allocation.

Conclusion: Current federated learning client evaluation focusing only on performance metrics is insufficient. A comprehensive evaluation must consider multiple trustworthiness dimensions, requiring multi-dimensional assessment frameworks to ensure fair contribution recognition and reward allocation.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.

*Afshin Khadangi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRC² is a decoder-only architecture for language models that improves continual learning through sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns, enabling better stability-plasticity tradeoff with efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard language model training pipelines are brittle under non-stationary data, causing catastrophic forgetting during online updates. Existing methods that improve stability often increase latency, memory, or computation in ways that don't scale well to long contexts.

Method: TRC² combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, plus a fast corrective pathway for rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The architecture is sparse and chunk-parallel for efficient training/inference.

Result: TRC² improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: TRC² addresses continual learning at the architectural level, offering a scalable solution for deployed language models that need to learn continuously without catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

### [116] [Reinforcement-aware Knowledge Distillation for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22495)
*Zhaoyang Zhang,Shuli Jiang,Yantao Shen,Yuting Zhang,Dhananjay Ram,Shuo Yang,Zhuowen Tu,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLAD (RL-aware distillation) is a new knowledge distillation method that selectively imitates teacher LLMs during reinforcement learning, addressing distribution mismatch and objective interference issues in existing distillation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning post-training has improved long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, but these models have high inference costs. While knowledge distillation can transfer capabilities to smaller student models, existing KD methods designed for supervised fine-tuning suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference when combined with RL. Teacher supervision often doesn't align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and KL regularization can compete with reward maximization.

Method: RLAD performs selective imitation during RL, guiding students toward teachers only when it improves the current policy update. The core component is Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), which replaces teacher-student KL regularization with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher-old-policy mixture. This yields advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts, naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation.

Result: Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: RLAD provides an effective approach for distilling reinforcement learning capabilities from large teacher LLMs to smaller student models, addressing key limitations of existing distillation methods by enabling selective, advantage-aware imitation that aligns with RL training objectives.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.

*Yuchen Liang,Zhiheng Tan,Ness Shroff,Yingbin Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of discrete diffusion samplers: improved convergence bounds for Euler method and first analysis of First-Hitting Sampler


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models show strong empirical performance but theoretical understanding remains limited, especially for new samplers like First-Hitting Sampler

Method: Developed TV-based analysis for Euler method, matching upper and lower bounds, and analyzed FHS sampler with decoupling-based path-wise analysis

Result: Relaxed assumptions, improved parameter dependencies, established convergence without surrogate initialization, proved FHS incurs no additional sampling error

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive theoretical understanding of discrete diffusion samplers with tight bounds and novel analysis techniques

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved strong empirical performance in text and other symbolic domains, with masked (absorbing-rate) variants emerging as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models. Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.

### [118] [Space Syntax-guided Post-training for Residential Floor Plan Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22507)
*Zhuoyang Jiang,Dongqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-training method called SSPT injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation using non-differentiable oracle to improve architectural priors like public space dominance and functional hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans often under-emphasize critical architectural priors like configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (living rooms, foyers) by focusing too much on fitting large-scale data distributions.

Method: SSPT (Space Syntax-guided Post-training) uses a non-differentiable oracle that converts layouts into rectangle-space graphs via greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance. Two strategies: (1) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, (2) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards.

Result: Both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines. PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance.

Conclusion: SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle. The approach successfully bridges architectural principles with data-driven methods.

Abstract: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.

*Xiannan Huang,Shen Fang,Shuhan Qiu,Chengcheng Yu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEFL is a temporal error feedback learning framework that incorporates historical prediction residuals into deep time series forecasting to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep forecasting models are trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss but ignore valuable information in past prediction residuals, which reflect biases, unmodeled patterns, and evolving dynamics.

Method: Proposes TEFL framework that addresses three challenges: selecting observable multi-step residuals under partial observability, integrating them via lightweight low-rank adapters for efficiency, and using two-stage training to jointly optimize base forecaster and error module.

Result: Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets with 5 backbone architectures show consistent 5-10% MAE reduction on average, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios like abrupt changes and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems by embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.

*Ying Zhu,Ruthuparna Naikar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning method predicts professional tennis players' first serve directions, achieving 49% accuracy for males and 44% for females, revealing strategic serve patterns and fatigue influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serves are crucial in professional tennis with servers trying to be strategic yet unpredictable, while returners try to anticipate serve directions. Understanding this strategic mind game between players is important for analyzing tennis decision-making.

Method: Developed a machine learning method for predicting first serve directions through feature engineering to analyze serve decision patterns in professional tennis matches.

Result: Achieved average prediction accuracy of around 49% for male players and 44% for female players. Analysis provided evidence that top players use mixed-strategy models in serving decisions and that fatigue might influence serve direction choices.

Conclusion: The analysis suggests that contextual information may be more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought, highlighting the complexity of strategic decision-making in professional tennis serve directions.

Abstract: Serves, especially first serves, are very important in professional tennis. Servers choose their serve directions strategically to maximize their winning chances while trying to be unpredictable. On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\% for male players and 44\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.

*Dezhi Yang,Qiaoyu Tan,Carlotta Domeniconi,Jun Wang,Lizhen Cui,Guoxian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyCausal is a dynamic causal structure learning framework that uses convolutional networks and linear interpolation to capture time-varying causal relationships, addressing the limitations of traditional stationary causality assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for learning causal structures in time series rely on distributional or structural invariance, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. These assumptions conflict with complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems, creating a need for methods that address fully dynamic causality where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time.

Method: DyCausal uses convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step for fine-grained time-varying causal graphs. It also proposes an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling to improve efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine.

Conclusion: DyCausal effectively addresses the challenges of fully dynamic causality in time series by combining convolutional pattern recognition with interpolation refinement, providing a practical solution for learning complex, time-varying causal relationships in real-world systems.

Abstract: Learning the dynamic causal structure of time series is a challenging problem. Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine.

*Jichao Zhang,Ran Miao,Limin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Persistent Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (pNMF) extends traditional NMF to capture multi-scale connectivity structures across resolutions using persistence-aligned embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NMF methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across different resolutions, limiting their ability to represent complex multi-scale data relationships.

Method: Proposes pNMF as a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems that produces sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings. Uses persistent homology to identify canonical minimal sufficient scales where connectivity changes qualitatively, inducing sequence of graph Laplacians with coupled NMF formulation, scale-wise geometric regularization, and cross-scale consistency constraints.

Result: Develops structural analysis of embeddings along scale parameter with bounds on increments between scales. Creates nontrivial solution path across scales (not single factorization). Implements sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Validated on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets showing effectiveness for multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Conclusion: pNMF successfully addresses the single-scale limitation of traditional NMF by providing a principled multi-scale framework that captures evolving connectivity structures, with theoretical guarantees and practical applicability to complex biological data like single-cell RNA sequencing.

Abstract: Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Motivation: Designing effective SciML models requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly for determining input features and model size. Current approaches rely heavily on manual tuning, making SciML model design challenging and inaccessible.

Method: LUMOS uses L0-regularized learning with semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques to dynamically select informative features and prune redundant parameters during training, unifying feature selection and model pruning in an end-to-end framework.

Result: Experiments across 13 diverse SciML workloads (cosmology, molecular sciences, etc.) show LUMOS achieves 71.45% parameter reduction and 6.4x inference speedup on average. Distributed Data Parallel training on up to eight GPUs confirms scalability.

Conclusion: LUMOS democratizes SciML model design by reducing reliance on manual expertise while maintaining predictive accuracy, making SciML more accessible and efficient across diverse scientific domains.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific machine learning (SciML) has accelerated discovery across diverse domains, yet designing effective SciML models remains a challenging task. In practice, building such models often requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly in determining which input features to use and how large the model should be. We introduce LUMOS, an end-to-end framework based on L0-regularized learning that unifies feature selection and model pruning to democratize SciML model design. By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy. We evaluate LUMOS across 13 diverse SciML workloads, including cosmology and molecular sciences, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging) is a gradient-free method that integrates instruction-tuned models into large reasoning models to improve instruction following while preserving reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions about output format, constraints, or specific requirements. There's a gap between their reasoning capabilities and instruction adherence.

Method: RAIN-Merging is a two-step gradient-free approach: 1) Projects the instruction-tuned model (ITM) task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens to preserve LRM's reasoning mechanisms; 2) Uses instruction attention estimation with a small calibration set to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage.

Result: The method substantially improves instruction adherence across four instruction-following benchmarks while maintaining reasoning quality across nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks. Gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.

Conclusion: RAIN-Merging effectively bridges the gap between reasoning capabilities and instruction following by strategically integrating instruction-tuned models into large reasoning models through careful subspace alignment and attention-guided scaling, achieving both improved instruction adherence and preserved reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.

*Zhikai Chen,Han Xie,Jian Zhang,Jiliang Tang,Xiang Song,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDL doesn't consistently beat DFS; task-specific signals enable better architecture selection; Relatron meta-selector improves performance with lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparative advantages of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) over traditional methods like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) are poorly understood, and there are no clear design principles for selecting effective architectures across diverse RDB tasks.

Method: Comprehensive study unifying RDL and DFS in shared design space; architecture-centric searches across diverse tasks; analysis of performance drivers; development of task signals (RDB task homophily and affinity embedding); creation of Relatron meta-selector with loss-landscape metrics for checkpoint selection.

Result: Three key findings: 1) RDL doesn't consistently outperform DFS; 2) No single architecture dominates across tasks; 3) Validation accuracy unreliable for architecture choice. Relatron achieves up to 18.5% improvement over baselines with 10x lower cost than alternatives.

Conclusion: Task-aware architecture selection using principled signals (RDB homophily and affinity embeddings) is crucial for optimal performance in relational database predictive modeling; Relatron provides effective meta-selection framework.

Abstract: Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.

TL;DR: A training-free alignment framework using Sparse Weight Editing to map harmful representations in low-resource languages to safety subspaces of high-resource languages, reducing safety bypass vulnerabilities without expensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages like English. Existing solutions are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data.

Method: Based on Sparse Weight Editing, identifying safety capabilities localized within sparse safety neurons. Formulates cross-lingual alignment as constrained linear transformation with closed-form solution to map harmful LRL representations to robust HRL safety subspaces while preserving utility via null-space projection.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) show substantial reduction in Attack Success Rate in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, achieved with single data-efficient calculation.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective, training-free approach to address LLM safety disparities across languages by aligning safety capabilities from high-resource to low-resource languages through sparse weight editing, offering a computationally efficient alternative to existing multilingual alignment methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages (LRLs) often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Existing solutions, such as multilingual supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifying that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons, we formulate the cross-lingual alignment problem as a constrained linear transformation. We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.

TL;DR: AVDE: A lightweight autoregressive framework for EEG-based visual decoding that outperforms SOTA methods with 10x fewer parameters using contrastive learning and next-scale prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-to-image decoding methods face modality gap challenges, require complex multi-stage adaptation prone to errors, and have high computational costs from large diffusion models that limit practical BCI applications.

Method: 1) Fine-tune LaBraM (pre-trained EEG model) via contrastive learning to align EEG-image representations; 2) Use autoregressive generation with "next-scale prediction": encode images into multi-scale VQ-VAE token maps, train transformer to predict finer-scale tokens from EEG embeddings as initial coarse representation.

Result: Outperforms previous SOTA methods on two datasets for both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, using only 10% of parameters. Visualization shows generative process reflects hierarchical nature of human visual perception.

Conclusion: Autoregressive models like AVDE show potential as efficient, interpretable tools for practical BCI applications, addressing computational overhead while maintaining performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in large reasoning models that reduces overthinking on simple queries while maintaining accuracy on complex ones, achieving both efficiency gains and improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models exhibit overthinking behavior on low-complexity queries, leading to inefficiency. Existing solutions have unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors across different query complexities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose models to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors for well-conditioned initialization. 2) Adaptive reinforcement learning with CPAS (Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and LAGR (Length-Aware Gradient Regulation) to stabilize optimization under reasoning-length heterogeneity.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B models show consistent improvements: up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. The approach shows robustness across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses overthinking in large reasoning models with stable adaptive thinking, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and demonstrating strong robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.

*Moirangthem Tiken Singh,Amit Kalita,Sapam Jitu Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A threshold optimization framework that balances safety, fairness, and efficiency under strict capacity constraints with a single global threshold for legal compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness interventions assume unlimited resources and use group-specific thresholds that violate anti-discrimination laws, creating a need for legally compliant approaches under real-world capacity constraints.

Method: A post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework with a parameterized ethical loss function and bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents exceeding available resources, enforcing a single global threshold for legal compliance.

Result: Capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities (determining thresholds in 80%+ of cases); under 25% capacity limits, the framework maintains high risk identification (recall 0.409-0.702) while standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to near-zero utility.

Conclusion: Theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain deployable, and the framework provides a practical, legally compliant mechanism for navigating ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.

*Yu Zhang,Songwei Liu,Chenqian Yan,Sheng Lin,Beichen Ning,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2O introduces online permutation and early stopping for sparse attention, enabling fine-grained importance-guided token loading and computation termination to overcome sparsity ceilings and reduce latency in long-context inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification methods have intrinsic sparsity ceilings that prevent further improvements, even with careful engineering.

Method: S2O performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation, inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping. It factorizes FlashAttention execution to load non-contiguous tokens, transforms explicit permutation into online index-guided discrete loading policy, and introduces an early-stopping rule that processes blocks from high to low importance and terminates when block scores fall below a threshold.

Result: On Llama-3.1-8B with 128K context: reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82× at matched sparsity, reduces prefill compute density by 3.31× at matched MSE, preserves end-to-end accuracy, achieves 7.51× attention speedup and 3.81× end-to-end speedup.

Conclusion: S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling for attention mechanisms by enabling fine-grained importance-guided computation with early stopping, providing significant performance improvements for long-context inference while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.
  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\times$ attention and 3.81$\times$ end-to-end speedups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circuit discovery approaches have two main limitations: they overlook the holistic nature of circuits within language models, and they require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is both inaccurate and inefficient.

Method: IBCircuit uses the Information Bottleneck principle to create an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery. It works end-to-end and can be applied to any given task without needing to design corrupted activations for each specific task.

Result: On the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identified more faithful and minimal circuits compared to recent related work, both in terms of critical node components and edge components.

Conclusion: IBCircuit provides an effective, generalizable approach to circuit discovery that overcomes the limitations of existing methods by capturing the holistic nature of circuits and eliminating the need for task-specific corrupted activation designs.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work.

TL;DR: TabDLM: A unified diffusion model framework that jointly generates tabular data with both structured features (numerical/categorical) and free-form text fields through bidirectional cross-modality attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields alongside structured data, but existing approaches struggle with joint modeling: diffusion models degrade text quality while LLM-based methods distort numerical values.

Method: TabDLM uses a joint numerical-language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) - text/categorical features through masked diffusion, numerical features through continuous diffusion with learned numeric token embeddings, with bidirectional attention for cross-modality interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate TabDLM's effectiveness compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines for free-form tabular data generation.

Conclusion: TabDLM provides a unified framework that successfully addresses the challenges of generating heterogeneous tabular data with both structured features and free-form text through joint diffusion modeling.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: pQuant is a novel quantization-aware training method that uses dual-branch architecture with 1-bit dominant branch and high-precision sensitive branch to achieve state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit (<2-bit) quantization for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization-aware training methods for extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) LLMs fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability due to a "parameter democratization effect" where all parameters become homogenized, severely limiting model expressivity.

Method: Proposes pQuant which decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: (1) a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation, and (2) a compact high-precision branch to preserve the most sensitive parameters. Uses tailored feature scaling to guide allocation of sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch, and extends this branch into multiple sparsely-activated experts for efficient capacity scaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization, offering substantial advantages for edge deployment of large language models.

Conclusion: pQuant successfully addresses the parameter democratization bottleneck in extremely low-bit quantization by parameter decoupling via dual-branch architecture, achieving superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training from scratch has emerged as a promising approach for building efficient large language models (LLMs) with extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit), which can offer substantial advantages for edge deployment. However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.

*Joshua S. Schiffman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers learn compact algorithmic cores—low-dimensional subspaces essential for task performance—that persist across different training runs and model scales, suggesting these invariant structures represent the computational essence rather than implementation details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental challenge in understanding how LLMs work internally: training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many different weight configurations can implement the same function. Researchers need to distinguish which internal structures reflect the actual computation versus which are accidents of particular training runs.

Method: The researchers extract "algorithmic cores"—compact subspaces that are necessary and sufficient for task performance. They analyze transformers trained on various tasks (Markov chains, modular addition, language modeling) to identify invariant structures across different training runs and scales.

Result: 1) Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same algorithmic cores. 2) Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. 3) Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, revealing a predictive model of memorization-to-generalization transition. 4) GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation.

Conclusion: Transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures that persist across training runs and scales. These low-dimensional invariants represent the computational essence, suggesting mechanistic interpretability should target these fundamental structures rather than implementation-specific details.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.

*Thanh-Dat Truong,Huu-Thien Tran,Jackson Cothren,Bhiksha Raj,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO/φ-DPO) framework addresses fairness issues in continual learning for Large Multimodal Models by extending DPO to handle imbalanced data distributions and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in continual learning for LMMs is an underexplored challenge, especially with imbalanced data distributions that cause biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. Current continual learning methods focus on catastrophic forgetting but overlook fairness issues arising from data imbalance.

Method: 1) Propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting using pairwise preference signals. 2) Identify limitations of conventional DPO with imbalanced data and develop φ-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. 3) Construct pairwise preference annotations for existing continual learning benchmarks to enable φ-DPO-based continual learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show φ-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods for LMMs. The approach successfully addresses both catastrophic forgetting and fairness issues from imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The proposed φ-DPO framework provides a comprehensive solution to both catastrophic forgetting and fairness in continual learning for LMMs, with theoretical analysis demonstrating its effectiveness in handling imbalanced data distributions while maintaining strong performance across tasks.

Abstract: Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.

*Tao Huang,Jiayang Meng,Xu Yang,Chen Hou,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves DP-SGD for conditional diffusion models by bounding conditioning representations to reduce gradient tail effects without modifying the DP mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous conditional contexts in diffusion models create heavy-tailed per-example gradients under DP-SGD, causing outlier-dominated updates, clipping bias, and degraded utility under privacy constraints.

Method: Proposes DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism that jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection.

Result: Improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting performance under matched privacy settings on real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks compared to vanilla DP-SGD, with improvements attributed to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion while preserving non-private training expressiveness.

Conclusion: Sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance, offering a drop-in solution that doesn't require modifying the DP-SGD mechanism itself.

Abstract: Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.

### [137] [Mitigating Membership Inference in Intermediate Representations via Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22611)
*Jiayang Meng,Tao Huang,Chen Hou,Guolong Zheng,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LM-DP-SGD introduces layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD that adaptively allocates privacy protection across neural network layers based on their varying vulnerability to membership inference attacks, improving privacy-utility trade-off under the same privacy budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Embedding-as-an-Interface settings, intermediate representations (IRs) from pre-trained models can leak training-set membership information through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Standard DP-SGD uses uniform, layer-agnostic noise multipliers but ignores that different layers have heterogeneous MIA vulnerability, leading to inefficient privacy protection allocation.

Method: LM-DP-SGD first trains a shadow model on public data to estimate layer-specific MIA risks: extracts IRs from train/test splits, fits per-layer MIA adversaries, and uses their attack error rates as risk estimates. Then during private training, it reweights each layer's gradient contribution according to these risk estimates while using global gradient clipping, providing layer-appropriate protection under fixed noise magnitude.

Result: Experiments show LM-DP-SGD reduces peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility under the same privacy budget, achieving superior privacy-utility trade-off compared to standard DP-SGD. The method also has theoretical guarantees for both privacy and convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed LM-DP-SGD framework effectively addresses heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability by adaptively allocating privacy protection, demonstrating better privacy-utility balance than uniform noise approaches while maintaining formal privacy guarantees.

Abstract: In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.

*Hai Huang,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STP (Semantic Tube Prediction) improves LLM data efficiency by 16x using geodesic-based regularization, violating Chinchilla scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling laws are descriptive but not optimal for data efficiency; few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws, which limits more efficient training.

Method: Introduces Geodesic Hypothesis (token sequences trace geodesics on semantic manifold), proposes Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task as JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to tubular neighborhood of geodesics without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations.

Result: STP improves signal-to-noise ratio, preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions, and allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16× less training data on NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating Chinchilla-style scaling laws.

Conclusion: Principled geometric priors like STP can surpass brute-force scaling, offering a path to more data-efficient LLM training that violates current descriptive scaling laws.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ContextRL is a novel RL framework using context augmentation to improve reward model accuracy and mitigate reward hacking, achieving significant performance gains on perception and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address bottlenecks in RL-based vision-language models, particularly issues with identifiability (difficulty in identifying high-quality reasoning processes) and reachability (challenges in generating correct responses from failed attempts).

Method: Proposes ContextRL with two key components: 1) providing full reference solutions as context to enable fine-grained process verification for better identifiability, and 2) using a multi-turn sampling strategy where reward models generate mistake reports to guide recovery of correct responses from failed attempts.

Result: ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency across 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks, enabling Qwen3-VL-8B to achieve performance comparable to 32B models while outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin and effectively mitigating reward hacking.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy, documents widespread reward hacking issues, and provides valuable insights for future RLVR research.

Abstract: We propose ContextRL, a novel framework that leverages context augmentation to overcome these bottlenecks. Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to "recover" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.

### [140] [Tackling Privacy Heterogeneity in Differentially Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22633)
*Ruichen Xu,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-aware client selection strategy for differentially private federated learning that addresses privacy heterogeneity among clients and improves model accuracy by up to 10% on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP-FL approaches assume uniform privacy budgets across all clients, but real-world scenarios have heterogeneous privacy requirements. Current client selection strategies can't distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates versus those adding substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints.

Method: First systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL with theoretical foundation via convergence analysis quantifying privacy heterogeneity's impact on training error. Proposed privacy-aware client selection strategy formulated as convex optimization that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error.

Result: Extensive experiments show up to 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. The approach effectively addresses privacy heterogeneity challenges in federated learning.

Conclusion: Incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection is crucial for practical and effective federated learning, and the proposed approach provides a systematic solution that significantly improves model accuracy while respecting varied privacy requirements across clients.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.

*Qin-Wen Luo,Sheng Ren,Xiang Chen,Rui Liu,Jun Fang,Naiqiang Tan,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEEH is a difficulty-aware RL approach that selectively applies entropy regularization to compress easy reasoning steps while exploring diverse paths for hard questions, balancing efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs creates prohibitive inference latency and computational costs due to verbose explicit reasoning steps. Existing compression methods sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity, triggering entropy collapse that prematurely shrinks exploration space and stifles discovery of valid reasoning paths for challenging questions.

Method: CEEH (Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones) dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization. It preserves diverse search space for hard questions while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances. Also introduces dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to historically shortest correct response to counteract entropy-induced length inflation.

Result: Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization approaches.

Conclusion: By dynamically adapting compression strategies based on question difficulty and using selective entropy regularization, CEEH achieves efficient reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, addressing the limitations of existing compression methods that suffer from entropy collapse and poor exploration.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.

*Lianze Shan,Jitao Zhao,Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Zhiyong Feng,Weixiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUG is a meta-path-aware universal graph pre-training approach for heterogeneous graphs that addresses challenges of diverse node types and varying meta-paths through input unification and shared encoder training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current universal graph pre-training methods focus primarily on homogeneous graphs, leaving heterogeneous graphs unexplored despite their greater structural and semantic complexity. Heterogeneous graphs present unique challenges: diverse node/relation types with dataset-specific semantics hinder unified representation space construction, and varying meta-paths across datasets make learned patterns difficult to transfer.

Method: Proposes MUG (Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training) with two key components: 1) an input unification module that integrates multiple node/relation types into unified representations projected into shared space via dimension-aware encoder, and 2) training a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views using a global objective that encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate MUG's effectiveness on real datasets, showing it can successfully handle the challenges of universal pre-training for heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: MUG successfully addresses the fundamental challenges of universal graph pre-training for heterogeneous graphs by unifying diverse schemas and learning transferable structural patterns across varying meta-paths, enabling effective generalization across downstream tasks.

Abstract: Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.

*Lianze Shan,Jitao Zhao,Dongxiao He,Siqi Liu,Jiaxu Cui,Weixiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEDA is a novel universal graph pre-training method that addresses limitations in existing approaches through semantic distribution alignment to learn effective knowledge across diverse graph domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph pre-training methods struggle with simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance when dealing with diverse graph domains. Current approaches use straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to properly align semantics and misleads models. Additionally, applying in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios arbitrarily limits their effectiveness in capturing knowledge from multiple graphs.

Method: LEDA introduces two key components: (1) a dimension projection unit that adaptively aligns diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss, and (2) a variational semantic inference module to obtain shared latent distributions that guide domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains to ensure cross-domain semantic learning.

Result: LEDA demonstrates strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Notably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms both in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.

Conclusion: The proposed LEDA model successfully addresses the challenges of universal graph pre-training by introducing effective semantic distribution alignment mechanisms, enabling better cross-domain knowledge transfer and superior performance across diverse graph applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework for forecasting antimicrobial resistance trends using WHO GLASS data and providing evidence-based policy support through a RAG system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat projected to cause 10 million annual deaths by 2050. While WHO GLASS provides standardized surveillance data, there's limited application of machine learning for forecasting population-level resistance trends from this data.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Benchmarking six ML models (Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge, XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM) on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six regions (2021-2023); 2) Implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline combining ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with Phi-3 Mini LLM for policy decision support.

Result: XGBoost achieved best performance with test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming naive baseline by 83.1%. Prior-year resistance rate was dominant predictor (50.5% importance). Regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). RAG system produced source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

Conclusion: The framework successfully forecasts AMR trends and provides evidence-grounded policy support, demonstrating the value of machine learning for antimicrobial resistance surveillance and intervention planning. The approach offers a practical tool for public health decision-making in combating AMR.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global crisis projected to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Duel-Evolve uses LLM's own pairwise preferences instead of scalar rewards to optimize outputs through evolutionary search with Bayesian modeling and Thompson sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar evaluators for LLM outputs are often unavailable, sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons are easier to elicit, provide useful improvement signals, and can be obtained from LLMs themselves without external supervision.

Method: Evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Uses Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to aggregate noisy comparisons, Double Thompson Sampling for budget allocation, and selects high-quality parents to generate improved candidates.

Result: Achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods on MathBench and improves by over 12 percentage points on LiveCodeBench. Requires no reward model, ground-truth labels during search, or hand-crafted scoring function.

Conclusion: Pairwise self-preferences from LLMs provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces, offering a practical alternative to unreliable scalar rewards.

Abstract: Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LITE is a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances optimization for LLM pre-training by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories, significantly accelerating existing matrix-based optimizers like Muon and SOAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training Large Language Models is computationally expensive, and existing matrix-based optimizers (like Muon and SOAP) tend to be relatively conservative along flat directions while potentially aggressive along sharp directions in anisotropic optimization landscapes.

Method: Established a unified Riemannian ODE framework showing preconditioners create Riemannian geometry to mitigate ill-conditioning and momentum acts as Riemannian damping. Proposed LITE, which applies larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates specifically along flat trajectories to enhance training dynamics.

Result: LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse settings: architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M-1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms faster convergence along flat directions.

Conclusion: LITE provides a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training by addressing the limitations of existing matrix-based optimizers, enabling faster convergence in anisotropic landscapes through targeted acceleration along flat trajectories.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency essential. The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

### [147] [Switch-Hurdle: A MoE Encoder with AR Hurdle Decoder for Intermittent Demand Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22685)
*Fabian Muşat,Simona Căbuz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Switch-Hurdle: A new Mixture-of-Experts + Hurdle-based framework for intermittent demand forecasting that separates sales occurrence and magnitude prediction, achieving SOTA performance with scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intermittent demand (long zero sequences with sporadic non-zero values) challenges both traditional forecasting methods (ARIMA, exponential smoothing, Croston) and modern neural architectures (DeepAR, Transformers). They either treat demand as continuous or become computationally expensive on sparse data, leading to underperformance.

Method: Switch-Hurdle integrates Mixture-of-Experts encoder with Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses sparse Top-1 expert routing forward with dense backward pass via straight-through estimator. The decoder uses cross-attention autoregressive design with shared hurdle head that separates forecasting into: 1) binary classification for sale probability, and 2) conditional regression for quantity given a sale.

Result: Empirical results on M5 benchmark and large proprietary retail dataset show Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: Switch-Hurdle effectively addresses intermittent demand forecasting challenges by explicitly separating occurrence and magnitude processes, outperforming existing methods while being computationally efficient for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Intermittent demand, a pattern characterized by long sequences of zero sales punctuated by sporadic, non-zero values, poses a persistent challenge in retail and supply chain forecasting. Both traditional methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or Croston variants, as well as modern neural architectures such as DeepAR and Transformer-based models often underperform on such data, as they treat demand as a single continuous process or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series. To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.

*Hao Yu,Shuning Jia,Guanghao Li,Wenhao Jiang,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoPerceive is a benchmark for evaluating geometric perception in vision-language models, and GeoDPO is a translator-guided reinforcement learning framework that significantly improves geometric reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with geometric reasoning due to limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. There's a need to isolate and evaluate geometric perception independently from reasoning, and to enhance VLMs' geometric perception capabilities.

Method: 1) Created GeoPerceive benchmark with diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations and an automatic data generation pipeline; 2) Developed GeoDPO framework using an NL-to-DSL translator trained on synthetic data to compute DSL-level scores as RL rewards.

Result: GeoDPO achieves substantial improvements: +26.5% on in-domain data, +8.0% on out-of-domain data, and +39.0% on downstream reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning offers only marginal improvements and may impair out-of-domain performance.

Conclusion: GeoDPO demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability over supervised fine-tuning, effectively bridging the gap between natural language and geometric domain-specific language through translator-guided reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive

*Vamshi Sunku Mohan,Kaustubh Gupta,Aneesha Das,Chandan Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers identify activation bottlenecks in Mamba SSM models and develop a simple steering intervention that boosts performance by 8.27% on average without task-specific tuning, then use this insight to create Stable-Mamba with improved long-context performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to transformers but lack interpretability and steerability. The Mamba family of SSM models, while promising, has underexplored opportunities for improvement through interpretability techniques.

Method: 1) Use mechanistic interpretability tools to identify activation subspace bottlenecks in Mamba SSM models; 2) Develop a test-time steering intervention that multiplies identified bottleneck activations by a scalar; 3) Validate findings by modifying bottlenecks to create Stable-Mamba architecture.

Result: The simple steering intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27% across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks without task-specific tuning. The identified bottlenecks were confirmed as performance hindrances, and the modified Stable-Mamba architecture achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability can effectively identify and address performance bottlenecks in SSMs like Mamba, enabling both simple steering interventions for immediate improvements and architectural modifications for enhanced long-context performance through models like Stable-Mamba.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient strategy for building powerful language models, avoiding the quadratic complexity of computing attention in transformers. Despite their promise, the interpretability and steerability of modern SSMs remain relatively underexplored. We take a major step in this direction by identifying activation subspace bottlenecks in the Mamba family of SSM models using tools from mechanistic interpretability. We then introduce a test-time steering intervention that simply multiplies the activations of the identified bottlenecks by a scalar. Across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks, this intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27%, without requiring any task-specific tuning. Finally, we validate that the identified bottlenecks are indeed hindering performance by modifying them to yield an architecture we call Stable-Mamba, which achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch.

TL;DR: A comparative study showing that distribution-based and set-based second-order uncertainty representations can be meaningfully compared despite their differing semantics, revealing insights into how representation choices impact practical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relative merits of two major second-order uncertainty paradigms (distribution-based vs set-based representations) remain unclear due to their fundamental differences in semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, as well as confounding variations in underlying predictive models.

Method: A controlled comparative study where both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by shared neural networks, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Evaluation uses 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks (including selective prediction and OOD detection), spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration.

Result: Meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative. The study provides insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance across different benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap between two fundamentally different uncertainty representation paradigms, demonstrating that principled comparisons are possible and yield valuable insights into representation effects on uncertainty quantification performance.

Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and heterogeneous numerical features poses scalability challenges. Existing models like GBDTs struggle with feature anisotropy, heavy-tailed distributions, non-stationarity, and require manual feature engineering.

Method: KMLP integrates a shallow Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) front-end with Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) backbone. KAN uses learnable activation functions to model complex non-linear transformations per feature, while gMLP captures high-order feature interactions.

Result: Experiments on public benchmarks and industrial datasets with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Advantages over GBDTs increase at larger scales, demonstrating scalability for web tabular data.

Conclusion: KMLP represents a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data, addressing key challenges in feature heterogeneity and scaling effectively to billion-sample datasets.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features faces significant scalability challenges. These features exhibit anisotropy, heavy-tailed distributions, and non-stationarity, creating bottlenecks for models like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and requiring laborious manual feature engineering. We introduce KMLP, a hybrid deep architecture integrating a shallow Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) front-end with a Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) backbone. The KAN front-end uses learnable activation functions to automatically model complex non-linear transformations for each feature, while the gMLP backbone captures high-order interactions. Experiments on public benchmarks and an industrial dataset with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with advantages over baselines like GBDTs increasing at larger scales, validating KMLP as a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data.

*Soroosh Miri,Sepehr Abolhasani,Shahrokh Farahmand,S. Mohammad Razavizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DA-DJSCC, a doubly adaptive deep joint source-channel coding method with channel-wise and spatial attention modules that dynamically adjust to varying SNR conditions, outperforming previous SNR-adaptive approaches for semantic communication in IoT networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT networks face challenges like limited bandwidth, constrained computational/energy resources, and dynamic wireless conditions. While DJSCC enables semantic communication, training separate DNNs for different SNRs creates excessive storage/communication overhead impractical for small IoT devices. Existing SNR-adaptive approaches have limitations that need improvement.

Method: Introduces DA-DJSCC that uses doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Builds upon ADJSCC but enhances it with simultaneous adaptation capabilities.

Result: Simulation results show DA-DJSCC significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria while incurring only a mild increase in complexity, making it suitable for performance-demanding but low-complexity IoT networks.

Conclusion: DA-DJSCC is a desirable choice for semantic communication in IoT networks as it offers superior performance through doubly adaptive attention mechanisms while maintaining manageable complexity, addressing key IoT constraints of limited resources and dynamic channel conditions.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks face significant challenges such as limited communication bandwidth, constrained computational and energy resources, and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions. Utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) combined with semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has recently been proposed to enable semantic communication of images. Building upon the original DJSCC formulation, low-complexity attention-style architectures has been added to the DNNs for further performance enhancement. As a main hurdle, training these DNNs separately for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will amount to excessive storage or communication overhead, which can not be maintained by small IoT devices. SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC), has been proposed to train the DNNs once but feed the current SNR as part of the data to the channel-wise attention mechanism. We improve upon ADJSCC by a simultaneous utilization of doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust and efficient feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed doubly adaptive DJSCC (DA-DJSCC) significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria, while incurring a mild increase in complexity. These facts render DA-DJSCC a desirable choice for semantic communication in performance demanding but low-complexity IoT networks.

*Luca Viano,Till Freihaut,Emanuele Nevali,Volkan Cevher,Matthieu Geist,Giorgia Ramponi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning in linear Markov games, showing feature-level concentrability coefficients can be smaller than state-action ones, and presenting efficient interactive algorithms with dimension-dependent sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for theoretical understanding of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in structured environments. Prior work had limitations with large concentrability coefficients that hindered sample efficiency, and there was lack of theoretical analysis for interactive MAIL settings.

Method: 1) Theoretical analysis leveraging linear structure in Markov games where transitions and rewards are linear in features; 2) Replacement of state-action level concentrability coefficient with feature-level coefficient; 3) Development of computationally efficient interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games; 4) Proposal of deep MAIL interactive algorithm for practical implementation.

Result: 1) Feature-level concentrability coefficient can be much smaller than state-action analog when features are informative; 2) First interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games with sample complexity depending only on feature dimension d; 3) Deep MAIL interactive algorithm outperforms behavioral cloning (BC) on games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis reveals structural advantages in linear Markov games, enabling more efficient multi-agent imitation learning through feature-based concentrability coefficients and interactive approaches. Practical deep implementations demonstrate effectiveness on benchmark games.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games where both the transition dynamics and each agent's reward function are linear in some given features. We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level "all policy deviation concentrability coefficient" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

TL;DR: Distributed prompt caching for edge LLM inference using cooperative state sharing across devices with Bloom-filter catalogs to reduce communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices creates severe performance bottlenecks that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes distributed prompt caching to share intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices, supporting partial matching for prompt similarity. Uses Bloom-filter-based catalogs to efficiently determine if remote servers have desired internal states, reducing unnecessary communication.

Result: Experiments with Gemma-3 270M model and MMLU dataset on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W show average reductions of 93.12% in Time to First Token (TTFT) and 50.07% in Time to Last Token (TTLT).

Conclusion: Distributed prompt caching with Bloom-filter catalogs effectively enhances edge LLM inference performance by reducing communication overhead and leveraging cooperative state sharing across devices.

Abstract: Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGPO addresses context inconsistency in stepwise group-based RL for long-horizon tasks by grouping steps hierarchically based on historical context consistency and aggregating advantages with adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stepwise group-based RL methods suffer from context inconsistency where steps within the same group have different historical contexts, leading to biased advantage estimation that degrades policy optimization.

Method: Proposes Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) which: 1) assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups based on historical context consistency, 2) computes distinct advantages within each group, 3) aggregates them with adaptive weighting to achieve bias-variance trade-off.

Result: HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods on ALFWorld and WebShop tasks using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models under the same computational constraints.

Conclusion: HGPO effectively addresses context inconsistency in stepwise group-based RL without extra models or rollouts, achieving better advantage estimation and policy optimization for long-horizon agentic tasks.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

*Anirudh Thatipelli,Ali Siahkoohi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for functional data clustering that maps discretized functions into fixed-dimensional vectors via hypernetwork-autoencoder architecture, making clustering robust to sampling resolution and independent of grid discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most functional data clustering methods operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than the underlying functions themselves. This creates unreliable clustering results that vary with technical sampling parameters.

Method: Introduces a framework using an auto-encoding architecture: a hypernetwork encoder maps coordinate-value pairs into weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. INRs represent functions with few parameters, yielding compact grid-independent representations. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates competitive clustering performance robust to sampling resolution changes, including generalization to resolutions not seen during training. Achieves through synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitation of grid-dependent clustering by creating resolution-agnostic function representations through INR-based autoencoding, enabling robust functional data clustering that depends only on the underlying functions rather than sampling artifacts.

Abstract: Functional data clustering is concerned with grouping functions that share similar structure, yet most existing methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than on the underlying functions themselves. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.

### [157] [Moral Preferences of LLMs Under Directed Contextual Influence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22831)
*Phil Blandfort,Tushar Karayil,Urja Pawar,Robert Graham,Alex McKenzie,Dmitrii Krasheninnikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs' moral decisions are significantly influenced by contextual cues in prompts, even when irrelevant, and baseline preferences don't predict steerability - models can appear neutral but show systematic bias under influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moral benchmarks for LLMs use context-free prompts assuming stable preferences, but real-world deployment includes contextual signals (user requests, social norms) that may steer decisions. The paper aims to understand how directed contextual influences reshape moral decisions.

Method: The authors introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage. For each demographic factor, they apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response.

Result: Four key findings: (1) Contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when superficially irrelevant; (2) Baseline preferences poorly predict directional steerability - models can appear baseline-neutral but show steerability asymmetry under influence; (3) Influences can backfire - models may claim neutrality yet their choices still shift, sometimes opposite to cue; (4) Reasoning reduces average sensitivity but amplifies effects of biased few-shot examples.

Conclusion: The findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior, moving beyond context-free assessments to account for how real-world contextual signals affect LLM moral decisions.

Abstract: Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

TL;DR: Decentralized algorithms for ranking aggregation (Borda, Copeland, median rank) using gossip communications with convergence guarantees and robustness to corrupted nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending consensus ranking computation to decentralized settings (peer-to-peer, IoT, multi-agent systems) where preference data is distributed across networks, addressing the methodological gap compared to centralized approaches.

Method: Random gossip communication enabling autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus through local interactions without central coordination; includes implementations for Borda, Copeland, median rank, and local Kemenization rules.

Result: Rigorous convergence guarantees with explicit rate bounds for Borda and Copeland methods; empirical evaluation shows algorithms converge quickly and reliably to correct ranking aggregation across various network topologies and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized approach successfully addresses consensus ranking computation in distributed settings, providing robustness, scalability through reduced communication costs, and reliable convergence to collective rankings.

Abstract: The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.
  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.

TL;DR: A deep learning model (MEDNA-DFM) for DNA methylation prediction that combines high accuracy with explainable AI to reveal biological insights about conserved methylation patterns and motif-function relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to bridge the gap between accurate DNA methylation prediction using deep learning and the lack of biological interpretability from "black-box" models, aiming to extract meaningful biological insights from methylation patterns.

Method: Developed MEDNA-DFM, a high-performance deep learning model for DNA methylation prediction, complemented by mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms to extract reliable motifs and validate biological hypotheses.

Result: The model captures conserved methylation patterns across species, demonstrates generalization driven by intrinsic motifs rather than phylogenetic proximity, extracts more reliable motifs than previous studies, and provides empirical support for a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis in Drosophila 6mA regulation.

Conclusion: The work provides both a powerful methylation prediction tool and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and generate testable biological hypotheses, advancing the field beyond pure prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate computational identification of DNA methylation is essential for understanding epigenetic regulation. Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its "black-box" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.

TL;DR: Axiomatic characterization shows SHAP explanations for multi-output predictors must decompose component-wise across outputs due to Shapley axiom constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP explanations are commonly computed independently for each output coordinate, but the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. The paper aims to formalize the structural constraints in Shapley-based interpretability for multi-output models.

Method: Extends classical Shapley axioms (efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, additivity) to vector-valued cooperative games. Uses a rigidity theorem approach to establish theoretical constraints. Includes numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark to demonstrate practical implications.

Result: Establishes that any attribution rule satisfying the classical Shapley axioms must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Shows that joint-output attribution rules require relaxing at least one classical axiom. Demonstrates computational savings in training/deployment while maintaining SHAP consistency.

Conclusion: The paper identifies a fundamental structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying that multi-output SHAP explanations must be component-wise unless classical axioms are relaxed, providing theoretical justification for current practices.

Abstract: In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using tabular data effectively predicts CRRT membrane fouling with high sensitivity/specificity, outperforms LSTM models, and enables interpretable counterfactual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an interpretable, data-driven machine learning model for predicting membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT), which can guide therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management.

Method: Used time-series ICU data with 16 clinically selected features; applied ADASYN oversampling to handle class imbalance; tested Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models; compared with LSTM; used tabular data approach for interpretability and counterfactual analysis; performed feature selection; applied Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis.

Result: Achieved 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at 10% rebalancing rate; tabular approach outperformed LSTM; feature selection reduced model to 5 key variables with minimal accuracy loss; counterfactual analysis successfully identified minimal input changes to reverse fouling predictions; results remained robust across forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: Interpretable machine learning models are viable for predicting CRRT membrane fouling, with the integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offering practical clinical value for guiding therapeutic adjustments and improving patient management.

Abstract: This study investigates a data-driven machine learning approach to predict membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT). Using time-series data from an ICU, 16 clinically selected features were identified to train predictive models. To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT. The integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offers practical clinical value, potentially guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management.

*Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoRA introduces non-linear rank adaptation with SiLU gating and structural dropout to break LoRA's linear ceiling, achieving better performance at much lower ranks on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA faces a critical "linear ceiling" in complex reasoning tasks where increasing rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints.

Method: Introduces NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion and prevent rank collapse.

Result: NoRA at rank 64 outperforms LoRA at rank 512 on SlimOrca (PPL 3.89 vs 3.90), and achieves PPL 1.97 vs LoRA's 2.07 on MathInstruct, demonstrating superior spectral efficiency.

Conclusion: NoRA breaks the linear barrier of LoRA by activating dormant tail singular values, preventing rank collapse, and offers a more efficient approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.

*Wenquan Ma,Yang Sui,Jiaye Teng,Bohan Wang,Jing Xu,Jingqin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalization bounds for homogeneous neural networks allow slower stepsize decay (Ω(1/√t)) compared to traditional requirements (O(1/t)), expanding practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithmic stability analysis requires restrictive stepsize decay (η_t = O(1/t)) for generalization bounds in non-convex settings, which may hinder optimization performance and doesn't match practical usage patterns.

Method: Derive generalization bounds under homogeneous neural network regimes using algorithmic stability techniques, proving that these networks enable slower stepsize decay while maintaining stability guarantees.

Result: Homogeneous neural networks permit slower stepsize decay of order Ω(1/√t) under mild assumptions, with extensions to non-Lipschitz regimes, applicable to common architectures like fully-connected and convolutional networks with ReLU/LeakyReLU activations.

Conclusion: The homogeneous property of common neural networks provides more flexible stepsize schedules for optimization while maintaining generalization guarantees, bridging theoretical requirements with practical optimization practices.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $η_t = \mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $Ω(1/\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.

TL;DR: MSINO is a neural network training framework for Riemannian manifolds that uses covariant Sobolev loss and Laplace-Beltrami regularization, providing curvature-aware convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural network training on Riemannian manifolds lacks curvature-aware convergence guarantees, and prior Sobolev training methods in Euclidean space don't account for manifold geometry and parallel transport of gradients.

Method: Replaces Euclidean derivative supervision with a covariant Sobolev loss that aligns gradients using parallel transport and adds Laplace-Beltrami smoothness regularization. Derives geometry-dependent constants for convergence analysis based on Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory.

Result: Establishes: (1) Descent Lemma with manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (2) Sobolev Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence for Riemannian gradient descent/SGD, (3) two-step Newton-Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature-controlled neighborhoods.

Conclusion: MSINO provides curvature-aware training guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians, unifying value and gradient-based learning on manifolds for applications like surface imaging, physics-informed learning, and robotics on Lie groups.

Abstract: We introduce Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO), a curvature aware training framework for neural networks defined on Riemannian manifolds. The method replaces standard Euclidean derivative supervision with a covariant Sobolev loss that aligns gradients using parallel transport and improves stability via a Laplace Beltrami smoothness regularization term.
  Building on classical results in Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory on manifolds, we derive geometry dependent constants that yield (i) a Descent Lemma with a manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (ii) a Sobolev Polyak Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence guarantees for Riemannian gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent under explicit step size bounds, and (iii) a two step Newton Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature controlled neighborhoods.
  Unlike prior Sobolev training in Euclidean space, MSINO provides training time guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians. Applications include surface imaging, physics informed learning settings, and robotics on Lie groups such as SO(3) and SE(3). The framework unifies value and gradient based learning with curvature aware convergence guarantees for neural training on manifolds.

*Yuejiang Yu,Langwen Huang,Alexandru Calotoiu,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weather forecasting models follow different scaling laws than language models - they favor wider architectures over deeper ones, and longer training over larger models under fixed compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven weather models are revolutionizing forecasting, but optimal training strategies are not well understood. The paper aims to establish empirical scaling laws for weather forecasting models to guide efficient model development and resource allocation.

Method: Analyzes empirical scaling laws by investigating relationships between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size (N), dataset size (D), and compute budget (C). Compares different models including Aurora and GraphCast, examines compute-optimal resource allocation, and analyzes model shape (width vs depth).

Result: Aurora shows strongest data-scaling (10x dataset reduces loss by 3.2x), GraphCast has highest parameter efficiency but limited hardware utilization. Under fixed compute budgets, longer training yields better performance than increasing model size. Weather models favor increased width over depth, unlike language models.

Conclusion: Future weather forecasting models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance, rather than following scaling patterns observed in language models.

Abstract: Data-driven models are revolutionizing weather forecasting. To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance.

*Bum Jun Kim,Shohei Taniguchi,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RKSP predicts transformer training divergence from a single forward pass by analyzing Koopman spectral features, achieving 0.995 AUROC. KSS actively prevents divergence by reshaping spectra during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training divergence in transformers wastes computational resources, but practitioners typically discover instability only after expensive training runs have begun. There is a need for methods to estimate the probability of training failure before training starts.

Method: Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) extracts Koopman spectral features from a single forward pass at initialization using whitened dynamic mode decomposition on layer-wise residual snapshots. The key diagnostic is "near-unit spectral mass" - the fraction of modes near the unit circle, which quantifies instability risk. Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS) is an actionable intervention that reshapes spectra during training to prevent divergence.

Result: RKSP achieves 0.995 AUROC for predicting divergence across extensive configurations, outperforming gradient-based baselines. KSS reduces divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% in high learning rate regimes without normalization layers, enabling 50-150% higher learning rates. The approach generalizes to diverse architectures including GPT-2, LLaMA-2 7B, vision transformers, MoE, Mamba-style SSMs, and KAN.

Conclusion: RKSP provides an effective method for predicting transformer training divergence at initialization, and KSS offers an actionable intervention to prevent divergence. This enables more efficient resource allocation and training stability across diverse modern architectures.

Abstract: Training divergence in transformers wastes compute, yet practitioners discover instability only after expensive runs begin. They therefore need an expected probability of failure for a transformer before training starts. Our study of Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) provides such an estimate. From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence. In the challenging high learning rate regime without normalization layers, KSS reduces the divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables learning rates that are 50% to 150% higher. These findings generalize to WikiText-103 language modeling, vision transformers on CIFAR-10, and pretrained language models, including GPT-2 and LLaMA-2 up to 7B, as well as emerging architectures such as MoE, Mamba-style SSMs, and KAN.

Conclusion: EMPO² is a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents, addressing the exploration bottleneck in RL-trained language model agents.

Abstract: Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it.

TL;DR: A physics-informed latent relational framework models cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in graphs, revealing disease severity and intervention effects through vortex interaction patterns and graph entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features in cardiac blood flow patterns, which contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions.

Method: Proposed a physics-informed latent relational framework combining neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a latent graph.

Result: In aortic coarctation simulations, vortex interactions strengthen and become more frequent as the aortic radius narrows, leading to higher graph entropy that correlates strongly with disease severity (R²=0.78, Spearman |ρ|=0.96). For left ventricle ultrasound datasets with LVAD support, the latent graph captures weakening of coherent vortical structures, demonstrating cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: Latent interaction graphs and their entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention, providing a framework that generalizes across imaging modalities.

Abstract: Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization framework for training deep state-space models and introduces EKVAE, which combines variational inference with Bayesian filtering/smoothing to better capture underlying dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep state-space models (DSSMs) trained with evidence lower bound maximization don't actually ensure learning of the true underlying system dynamics, leading to poor system identification.

Method: Proposes a constrained optimization framework for training DSSMs that enforces learning of dynamics. Introduces Extended Kalman VAE (EKVAE) which combines amortized variational inference with classic Bayesian filtering/smoothing techniques.

Result: The constrained optimization framework significantly improves system identification and prediction accuracy on established DSSMs. EKVAE outperforms previous models in prediction accuracy, achieves remarkable system identification results, and can disentangle static and dynamic features.

Conclusion: The proposed constrained optimization framework and EKVAE model represent important advances in deep state-space modeling, enabling more accurate learning of underlying system dynamics and better temporal predictions.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (DSSMs) enable temporal predictions by learning the underlying dynamics of observed sequence data. They are often trained by maximising the evidence lower bound. However, as we show, this does not ensure the model actually learns the underlying dynamics. We therefore propose a constrained optimisation framework as a general approach for training DSSMs. Building upon this, we introduce the extended Kalman VAE (EKVAE), which combines amortised variational inference with classic Bayesian filtering/smoothing to model dynamics more accurately than RNN-based DSSMs. Our results show that the constrained optimisation framework significantly improves system identification and prediction accuracy on the example of established state-of-the-art DSSMs. The EKVAE outperforms previous models w.r.t. prediction accuracy, achieves remarkable results in identifying dynamical systems, and can furthermore successfully learn state-space representations where static and dynamic features are disentangled.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhythmBERT is a generative ECG language model that treats ECG signals as structured language, using discrete tokens for rhythm semantics and continuous embeddings for morphology, achieving strong performance with single-lead data comparable to 12-lead baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Contrastive methods use augmentations that distort morphology, while generative approaches use fixed-window segmentation that misaligns cardiac cycles.

Method: RhythmBERT encodes P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations, creating discrete tokens for rhythm semantics with complementary continuous embeddings for fine-grained morphology. It's pretrained on ~800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings using masked prediction objective.

Result: Despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. It generalizes well from prevalent conditions like atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases like subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction.

Conclusion: Treating ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis, enabling label-efficient learning with strong generalization across diverse cardiac conditions.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network approach to Bayesian filtering that combines particle flow filters with neural networks, using PDE constraints for unsupervised learning of transport velocity fields to overcome stiffness issues in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian updates in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation are computationally challenging. Traditional particle flow filters yield stiff differential equations, while deep learning approaches either treat the update as a black-box or neglect the geometric structure of finite-horizon probability transport.

Method: Proposes physics-informed neural particle flow, an amortized inference framework that couples log-homotopy trajectory with continuity equations to derive a governing PDE (master PDE). This PDE is embedded as a physical constraint in the loss function to train a neural network to approximate transport velocity field, enabling unsupervised training without ground-truth posterior samples.

Result: Neural parameterization acts as implicit regularizer, mitigating numerical stiffness of analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and challenging nonlinear scenarios shows better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed neural particle flow successfully addresses computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian estimation by combining geometric structure preservation with neural network flexibility, achieving improved performance while eliminating the need for supervised training data.

Abstract: The Bayesian update step poses significant computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation. While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations. Conversely, existing deep learning approximations typically treat the update as a black-box task or rely on asymptotic relaxation, neglecting the exact geometric structure of the finite-horizon probability transport. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: PRAC is a novel activation compression method that decomposes activations into principal and random subspaces using SVD, achieving up to 36% memory reduction in LLM training with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training, and existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, leading to slow convergence or limited compression.

Method: PRAC decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. It introduces a precise scaling factor to create an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance.

Result: PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost, as demonstrated in extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: PRAC effectively addresses the activation memory bottleneck in LLM training by bridging algorithmic convergence requirements with subspace projection theory, providing a practical solution with proven theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators struggle with generalization beyond training distributions and are constrained to fixed temporal discretizations, limiting their practical utility for solving PDEs in novel physical regimes.

Method: Decomposes PDEs using operator splitting methods, trains separate neural operators for individual nonlinear physical operators, approximates linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions, formulates modeling as neural ODE with learned operators as right-hand side, enables continuous-time predictions via standard ODE solvers.

Result: Achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalizing to unseen physics on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, enables temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, remains parameter-efficient, and provides interpretable components with verifiable physics behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed training framework addresses key limitations of neural operators for PDEs by enabling generalization to novel physical regimes through explicit operator structure encoding, continuous-time predictions, and modular mixture-of-experts architecture while maintaining physics interpretability.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but struggle to generalise beyond training distributions and are often constrained to a fixed temporal discretisation. This work introduces a physics-informed training framework that addresses these limitations by decomposing PDEs using operator splitting methods, training separate neural operators to learn individual non-linear physical operators while approximating linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions. This modular mixture-of-experts architecture enables generalisation to novel physical regimes by explicitly encoding the underlying operator structure. We formulate the modelling task as a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) where these learned operators constitute the right-hand side, enabling continuous-in-time predictions through standard ODE solvers and implicitly enforcing PDE constraints. Demonstrated on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalising to unseen physics. The method remains parameter-efficient, enabling temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, and provides interpretable components whose behaviour can be verified against known physics.

*Junghyun Lee,Minju Hong,Kwang-Sung Jun,Chulhee Yun,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First statistical guarantees for online RLHF with general preferences, achieving either polylogarithmic or dimension-free regret depending on algorithm choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address contextual online RLHF with general preferences (including intransitive preferences) and move beyond limitations of prior works restricted to specific regularizers.

Method: Use Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) with low-rank skew-symmetric matrices; analyze greedy policy dual gap bound from strong convexity; propose two algorithms: Greedy Sampling and Explore-Then-Commit.

Result: Greedy Sampling achieves Õ(ηd⁴(logT)²) regret; Explore-Then-Commit achieves Õ(√ηrT) regret - first statistically efficient high-dimensional guarantee for online RLHF.

Conclusion: The paper provides first rigorous guarantees for online RLHF with general preferences, offering algorithm choices with different regret-vs-complexity tradeoffs.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual online RLHF with general preferences, where the goal is to identify the Nash Equilibrium. We adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to capture potentially intransitive preferences via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices. We investigate general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer (where $η^{-1}$ is the regularization strength), generalizing beyond prior works limited to reverse KL-regularization. Central to our analysis is proving that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error - a result derived solely from strong convexity and the skew-symmetricity of GBPM.Building on this insight and a feature diversity assumption, we establish two regret bounds via two simple algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling achieves polylogarithmic, $e^{O(η)}$-free regret $\tilde{O}(ηd^4 (\log T)^2)$. (2) Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{ηr T})$ by exploiting the low-rank structure; this is the first statistically efficient guarantee for online RLHF in high-dimensions.

### [175] [Bound to Disagree: Generalization Bounds via Certifiable Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23128)
*Mathieu Bazinet,Valentina Zantedeschi,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes disagreement-based certificates to bound the generalization gap between any two predictors, enabling non-vacuous generalization guarantees for deep learning models without modifying the target model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generalization bounds for deep learning are typically vacuous, not computable, or restricted to specific model classes, creating a need for practical and generalizable certification methods.

Method: The method uses disagreement-based certificates to bound the true risk gap between any two predictors, then bounds the target predictor's true risk via a surrogate model with tight generalization guarantees. This is evaluated on unlabeled data without modifying the target model.

Result: The approach demonstrates tight certificates empirically and shows versatility by training surrogate models using three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression, and PAC-Bayes theory.

Conclusion: The method provides practical generalization guarantees for any deep learning model without requiring modifications to the target model or training procedure, addressing key limitations of existing generalization bounds.

Abstract: Generalization bounds for deep learning models are typically vacuous, not computable or restricted to specific model classes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by providing new disagreement-based certificates for the gap between the true risk of any two predictors. We then bound the true risk of the predictor of interest via a surrogate model that enjoys tight generalization guarantees, and evaluating our disagreement bound on an unlabeled dataset. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of the obtained certificates and showcase the versatility of the approach by training surrogate models leveraging three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression and PAC-Bayes theory. Importantly, such guarantees are achieved without modifying the target model, nor adapting the training procedure to the generalization framework.

*Tyler Bonnet,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyGnROLE is a transformer-based dynamic graph architecture that uses separate embeddings for source and destination nodes with role-semantic positional encodings and self-supervised pretraining via Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world dynamic graphs are directed with asymmetrical behavioral patterns between source and destination nodes, but existing architectures use shared parameters without systematic role-aware modeling.

Method: Proposes DyGnROLE with separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings to capture distinct structural and temporal contexts for each role, plus TCLP self-supervised pretraining using full unlabeled interaction history.

Result: DyGnROLE substantially outperforms diverse state-of-the-art baselines on future edge classification tasks.

Conclusion: Role-aware modeling is an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning, and the proposed approach successfully captures asymmetrical patterns in directed dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.

*Zeno Romero,Kerstin Münnemann,Hans Hasse,Fabian Jirasek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid tensor completion method that predicts temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures by combining experimental data with semi-empirical priors and enhancing predictions through active learning-guided experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental diffusion coefficient data in mixtures is scarce, and existing matrix completion methods (MCMs) are limited to single-temperature predictions and heavily dependent on high-quality experimental data for each specific temperature.

Method: Developed a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) using Tucker decomposition trained on experimental diffusion coefficients at 298K, 313K, and 333K. Used SEGWE model predictions as prior knowledge in Bayesian framework, enabling linear extrapolation between 268K-378K. Enhanced database via active learning strategies and performed new PFG NMR measurements on 19 solute+solvent systems.

Result: TCM achieved markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. Active learning expansion with new experimental measurements resulted in substantial improvement in TCM's predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The combination of data-efficient machine learning methods (tensor completion) with adaptive experimentation (active learning) advances predictive modeling of transport properties and addresses the challenge of predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients with limited experimental data.

Abstract: Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.

### [178] [Partial recovery of meter-scale surface weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23146)
*Jonathan Giezendanner,Qidong Yang,Eric Schmitt,Anirban Chandra,Daniel Salles Civitarese,Johannes Jakubik,Jeremy Vila,Detlef Hohl,Campbell Watson,Sherrie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method that infers 10-meter resolution near-surface weather fields across the contiguous US by combining coarse atmospheric models with high-resolution Earth observation data, reducing wind error by 29% and temperature/dewpoint error by 6% compared to ERA5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weather analyses and forecasts lack meter-scale variability despite significant differences in near-surface atmospheric conditions over small distances due to land cover and topography. It's unclear whether this fine-scale variability is chaotic or contains predictable components from surface characteristics and large-scale forcing.

Method: Condition coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data to infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States.

Result: The inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature/dewpoint error by 6% relative to ERA5, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They capture physically interpretable patterns including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types.

Conclusion: A substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. The approach expands weather modeling frontiers by demonstrating computationally feasible continental-scale meter-resolution inference, showing how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved Earth system components.

Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

*Oshani Seneviratne,Fernando Spadea,Adrien Pavao,Aaron Micah Green,Kristin P. Bennett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FinSurvival Challenge 2025 as a Web3 temporal intelligence benchmark using 21.8M transaction records from Aave v3 to create 16 survival prediction tasks for modeling user behavior transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal Web analytics lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics (censoring and non-stationarity) across extended horizons, which slows methodological progress and limits technique transfer between Web3 and broader Web domains.

Method: The FinSurvival Challenge 2025 operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, serving as a case study in benchmarking temporal Web3 intelligence.

Result: Domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches in the survival prediction tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized temporal modeling for Web3 data.

Conclusion: Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying fundamental temporal challenges (churn, risk, and evolution) that are relevant to the wider Web, and the paper provides lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks.

Abstract: Temporal Web analytics increasingly relies on large-scale, longitudinal data to understand how users, content, and systems evolve over time. A rapidly growing frontier is the \emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.

### [180] [MetaOthello: A Controlled Study of Multiple World Models in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23164)
*Aviral Chawla,Galen Hall,Juniper Lovato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained on multiple Othello variants develop shared representations rather than partitioned sub-models, with linear probes transferable across games and representations showing systematic transformations for isomorphic variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how single transformers organize multiple world models or rule systems, as current mechanistic interpretability research focuses on single capabilities rather than multiple, potentially conflicting generative processes.

Method: Introduced MetaOthello - a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules/tokenizations, trained small GPTs on mixed-variant data, and analyzed how representations organize across different games using linear probes and intervention experiments.

Result: Transformers converge on mostly shared board-state representations that transfer causally across variants; linear probes trained on one variant can effectively intervene on another's internal state; isomorphic games show equivalent representations up to single orthogonal rotation; early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while middle layer identifies game identity and later layers specialize.

Conclusion: Transformers don't partition capacity into isolated sub-models but develop shared representations that support multiple world models, with systematic organization across layers. MetaOthello provides a framework for studying how transformers organize many world models simultaneously.

Abstract: Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, yet mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting "world models". Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize. MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.

*Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yaniv Nikankin,Anja Reusch,Tomer Tsaban,Ora Schueler-Furman,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLMs use a two-stage mechanism combining language pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge to detect protein repeats, with approximate repeat mechanisms functionally subsume exact repeat detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein sequences contain important repeating segments (both exact and approximate), which are crucial for structure and function. Recent work shows PLMs can identify these repeats via masked-token prediction, but their internal mechanisms remain unclear, motivating this investigation.

Method: The study investigates how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats by analyzing their internal mechanisms, focusing on understanding the hierarchical relationship between exact and approximate repeat detection and characterizing the specific components involved.

Result: PLMs use a two-stage mechanism: 1) Building feature representations using general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components (e.g., neurons encoding amino-acid similarity), and 2) Induction heads attending to aligned tokens across repeated segments to promote correct predictions. The mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats.

Conclusion: PLMs solve protein repeat detection by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge. This establishes a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs and reveals how they integrate general linguistic patterns with domain-specific biological understanding.

Abstract: Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.

### [182] [Closing the gap on tabular data with Fourier and Implicit Categorical Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23182)
*Marius Dragoi,Florin Gogianu,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning models can match or surpass XGBoost on tabular data by using statistical feature processing to identify discretized categorical features and Learned Fourier to mitigate neural networks' bias toward overly-smooth solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite deep learning's success across various data types, it consistently underperforms compared to tree-based methods (like XGBoost) on tabular data. The authors hypothesize this gap exists because tree-based methods naturally model non-linear interactions from features with categorical characteristics, while neural networks have biases toward uniform numerical processing and smooth solutions that don't align with tabular data properties.

Method: Two key approaches: 1) Statistical-based feature processing to identify features that show strong correlation with the target after discretization, helping capture categorical characteristics. 2) Learned Fourier technique to mitigate neural networks' bias for overly-smooth solutions, which is misaligned with tabular data's inherent properties.

Result: The proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts deep learning model performance on tabular data, enabling them to achieve performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.

Conclusion: By addressing neural networks' biases toward uniform processing and smooth solutions through statistical feature processing and Learned Fourier, deep learning models can effectively compete with and potentially outperform tree-based methods on tabular data, conquering what was previously considered neural networks' "last unconquered castle."

Abstract: While Deep Learning has demonstrated impressive results in applications on various data types, it continues to lag behind tree-based methods when applied to tabular data, often referred to as the last "unconquered castle" for neural networks. We hypothesize that a significant advantage of tree-based methods lies in their intrinsic capability to model and exploit non-linear interactions induced by features with categorical characteristics. In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.

*Ismaël Zighed,Andrea Nóvoa,Luca Magri,Taraneh Sayadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient retraining strategy for parameterized ROMs using VAE-transformer architecture that enables real-time adaptation with sparse data through encoder-only retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ROM retraining is computationally expensive and requires full-state observations. There's a need for efficient adaptation strategies that work with sparse data and can handle out-of-sample parameter regimes in real-time applications.

Method: Encode-process-decode architecture: VAE for dimensionality reduction, transformer network for evolving latent states and modeling dynamics parameterized by Reynolds number. After initial training, uses ensemble Kalman filtering to assimilate sparse data and focuses retraining only on the autoencoder component for efficient adaptation.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to full retraining with significantly less computational cost, works with sparse observations only, provides uncertainty quantification through ensemble generation, and identifies latent manifold distortions as the main error source for out-of-sample forecasts.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight retraining strategy focusing only on the autoencoder enables computationally efficient real-time adaptation of ROMs to new parameter regimes using very sparse data, making it practical for applications requiring rapid model updates.

Abstract: We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.

*Quang-Huy Nguyen,Jiaqi Wang,Wei-Shinn Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedWQ-CP is a simple yet effective federated uncertainty quantification method that uses conformal prediction with a single communication round to handle both data and model heterogeneity in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges in uncertainty quantification, and without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored.

Method: FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold.

Result: Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.

Conclusion: FedWQ-CP is an effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity of data and model differences in federated learning settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ). Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold.

### [185] [InnerQ: Hardware-aware Tuning-free Quantization of KV Cache for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23200)
*Sayed Mohammadreza Tayaranian Hosseini,Amir Ardakani,Warren J. Gross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InnerQ is a hardware-aware KV cache quantization method that groups cache matrices over their inner dimension to reduce decode latency while maintaining accuracy, achieving up to 22% speedup over previous work through optimized dequantization and hardware alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache for large language models scales with sequence length and dominates memory footprint during long-sequence generation. There's a need to reduce hardware footprint and decode latency without sacrificing accuracy, moving beyond previous quantization methods that focused only on compression.

Method: InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping KV cache matrices over their inner dimension (not outer dimension). This aligns dequantization with vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. Additional techniques include: (1) hybrid quantization per group (symmetric/asymmetric based on local statistics), (2) high-precision windows for recent tokens and attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage, and (3) per-channel normalization of key cache computed during prefill and folded into queries.

Result: InnerQ achieves up to 22% speedup over previous KV cache quantization methods and up to 88% speedup over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. Evaluation on Llama models shows it maintains few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior quantization methods.

Conclusion: InnerQ presents an effective hardware-aware KV cache quantization scheme that reduces decode latency without sacrificing accuracy by optimizing dequantization through inner-dimension grouping and additional fidelity-preserving techniques, making it practical for efficient long-sequence generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.

*Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz,Abhay Gupta,Chris Renard,Davis Blalock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOptim reduces training memory usage by over 50% through improved master weight splitting and 8-bit optimizer state quantization, cutting AdamW from 16 to 7 bytes per parameter with no quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard mixed-precision training requires excessive memory (16 bytes per parameter), making large models like 7B parameters impractical for researchers with limited accelerator memory (<100GB).

Method: Two key techniques: 1) Improved master weight splitting using tight bounds on quantization error, 2) Companding functions for 8-bit optimizer state quantization, combined with 16-bit gradients.

Result: Reduces AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter (5 bytes with gradient release), cuts checkpoint sizes by over 50%, with no measurable quality degradation on vision/language benchmarks including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.

Conclusion: FlashOptim enables training of large models with significantly less memory while preserving full model quality and API compatibility, making large-scale training more accessible.

Abstract: Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.
  We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two key techniques. First, we improve master weight splitting by finding and exploiting a tight bound on its quantization error. Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.
  Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible neural memory system that uses natural language instructions to control what AI models remember or ignore during continual learning, enabling selective adaptation to heterogeneous information sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods face limitations: fine-tuning is costly, in-context learning is brittle, and existing neural memory systems assume fixed objectives with homogeneous information streams, giving users no control over memory updates in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposed a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible memory updates based on natural language learning instructions, allowing adaptive agents to learn selectively from diverse information sources.

Result: Enables controlled continual learning where users can specify what the model should remember or ignore through natural language instructions, supporting applications where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.

Conclusion: This approach addresses key limitations in continual learning by providing user-controllable, instruction-based memory updates that can handle heterogeneous information streams in dynamic real-world applications like healthcare and customer service.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are deployed in diverse, non-stationary environments where they must continually adapt to new tasks and evolving knowledge. Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.

*Simon Roschmann,Paul Krzakala,Sonia Mazelet,Quentin Bouniot,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOTAlign is a two-stage semi-supervised framework that aligns frozen pretrained vision and language models with minimal paired data by first learning coarse alignment from few image-text pairs, then refining it using unpaired data via optimal transport divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning vision and language models rely on contrastive losses with millions of paired samples. The paper investigates whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision, addressing the Platonic Representation Hypothesis.

Method: SOTAlign: a two-stage framework. Stage 1 recovers coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher. Stage 2 refines alignment on unpaired samples via optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space.

Result: SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learns robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforms both supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Meaningful alignment of pretrained unimodal encoders can be achieved with substantially less supervision than current methods, and the proposed SOTAlign framework provides an effective solution for semi-supervised alignment with minimal paired data.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

*Hiroki Naganuma,Taiji Suzuki,Rio Yokota,Masahiro Nomura,Kohta Ishikawa,Ikuro Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) can effectively explain generalization gaps in deep neural networks near the neural tangent kernel regime, but correlation disappears outside this regime. TIC shows better hyperparameter trial pruning performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization measures for deep neural networks are challenging due to their complex, statistically singular nature. The study investigates when the classical Takeuchi's information criterion can effectively explain DNN generalization gaps.

Method: Theoretical analysis identifies conditions where TIC applies (near NTK regime). Experimental evaluation trains over 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures on 4 datasets, estimating TIC values with several approximation methods to examine correlation with generalization gaps.

Result: Estimated TIC values correlate well with generalization gaps near NTK regime, but correlation disappears outside this regime both theoretically and empirically. TIC demonstrates better trial pruning ability for hyperparameter optimization than existing methods.

Conclusion: TIC is a viable generalization measure for DNNs under specific conditions (near NTK regime), providing practical utility in hyperparameter optimization through effective trial pruning. The work establishes theoretical and empirical boundaries for TIC's applicability to deep learning models.

Abstract: Generalization measures have been studied extensively in the machine learning community to better characterize generalization gaps. However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistically singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult due to their complex nature. This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime. However, we show both theoretically and empirically that outside the NTK regime such correlation disappears. Finally, we demonstrate that TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.

### [190] [Model Agreement via Anchoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23360)
*Eric Eaton,Surbhi Goel,Marcel Hussing,Michael Kearns,Aaron Roth,Sikata Bela Sengupta,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing and bounding model disagreement (expected squared difference between independently trained models) with a general anchoring technique, applied to four common ML algorithms where disagreement decreases with key parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control model disagreement - the extent to which two independently trained ML models disagree in their predictions - and to provide generalizable analysis techniques for existing training methodologies.

Method: Developed a general anchoring technique that anchors to the average of two models, then applied it to analyze four algorithms: stacked aggregation (disagreement decreases with number of models), gradient boosting (decreases with iterations), neural network architecture search (decreases with architecture size), and regression trees (decreases with depth).

Result: Proved theoretical bounds showing model disagreement can be driven to zero for all four algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation as k→∞, (2) gradient boosting as iterations→∞, (3) neural nets as architecture size n→∞, (4) regression trees as depth d→∞. Initially shown for 1D regression with squared error, then generalized to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.

Conclusion: The proposed anchoring technique provides a simple yet powerful framework for analyzing model disagreement across various ML algorithms, demonstrating that disagreement can be systematically controlled and driven to zero through natural training parameters in several common learning scenarios.

Abstract: Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.
  We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis. We then apply this technique to prove disagreement bounds for four commonly used machine learning algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation over an arbitrary model class (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of models $k$ being stacked) (2) gradient boosting (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of iterations $k$) (3) neural network training with architecture search (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the size $n$ of the architecture being optimized over) and (4) regression tree training over all regression trees of fixed depth (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the depth $d$ of the tree architecture). For clarity, we work out our initial bounds in the setting of one-dimensional regression with squared error loss -- but then show that all of our results generalize to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed HJB regularization for offline goal-conditioned RL using Feynman-Kac theorem to enable stable Monte Carlo estimation, improving geometric consistency in navigation and manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline GCRL suffers from inaccurate value estimation due to limited state-action space coverage in static datasets. Physics-informed approaches using first-order PDEs like the Eikonal equation can be ill-posed in complex high-dimensional environments.

Method: Propose physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Use Feynman-Kac theorem to recast PDE solution as an expectation, enabling tractable Monte Carlo estimation that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients.

Result: The method improves geometric consistency and is broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional complex manipulation tasks, with open-source code available.

Conclusion: Physics-informed regularization based on HJB viscosity solutions provides better inductive bias for offline GCRL, with Feynman-Kac enabling stable Monte Carlo estimation that overcomes limitations of previous PDE-based approaches in complex environments.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

*Ilya Balabin,Thomas M. Kaiser*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new theoretical framework combining causality and machine learning for chemical biology, addressing the black-box nature of current ML approaches through the novel concept of 'focus'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning predictors in natural sciences are treated as black boxes without considering causal structure, lacking unified theoretical treatment despite impressive progress in data processing.

Method: Establishes formal framework combining chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory, and causality, introducing the concept of 'focus' for ML algorithms to identify hidden mechanisms in large datasets. Provides initial proof on Akt inhibitors.

Result: Presents the foundational causal structure framework for chemical biology phenomena extended to machine learning, with initial proof-of-concept demonstrated on a family of Akt inhibitors.

Conclusion: This is Part 1 of a three-paper series aiming to establish 'inferential mechanics' as a new mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in chemical biology without reductionism, with subsequent papers covering chemical similarity and experimental evidence of causal structures.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques are now routinely encountered in research laboratories across the globe. Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of interest. Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology. This series serves to establish for chemical biology a new kind of mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in Nature without the need for the tools of reductionism: inferential mechanics.

*Samuel Tonks,Steve Hood,Ryan Musso,Ceridwen Hopely,Steve Titus,Minh Doan,Iain Styles,Alexander Krull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Information Gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework for generative virtual staining models, enabling direct assessment of predicted posterior distributions that existing metrics cannot properly evaluate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for generative virtual staining models only assess marginal distribution accuracy over datasets, not the predicted posterior distributions for individual cells. Since the true posterior is unavailable, there's no direct way to evaluate these predicted posteriors that are crucial for high-throughput screening applications.

Method: The authors introduce Information Gain (IG) as a strictly proper scoring rule for cell-wise evaluation. IG has sound theoretical motivation and allows for interpretability and cross-model/feature comparisons. They evaluate both diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG alongside other metrics.

Result: IG reveals substantial performance differences between models that other metrics cannot detect. The framework successfully enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors at the cell level, providing insights that marginal distribution evaluations miss.

Conclusion: Information Gain provides a theoretically sound, interpretable framework for evaluating predicted posterior distributions in generative virtual staining models, addressing a critical gap in existing evaluation protocols and enabling more meaningful model comparisons for high-throughput screening applications.

Abstract: Generative virtual staining (VS) models for high-throughput screening (HTS) can provide an estimated posterior distribution of possible biological feature values for each input and cell. However, when evaluating a VS model, the true posterior is unavailable. Existing evaluation protocols only check the accuracy of the marginal distribution over the dataset rather than the predicted posteriors. We introduce information gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule and comes with a sound theoretical motivation allowing for interpretability, and for comparing results across models and features. We evaluate diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG and other metrics and show that IG can reveal substantial performance differences other metrics cannot.

*Camilo Gomez,Pengyang Wang,Liansheng Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft-Binary-Argmax, a differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss that enables gradient-based optimization while maintaining the benefits of the ideal classification loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The zero-one loss is considered the gold standard for classification but is incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. There's a need to integrate structured optimization components into differentiable models to provide better inductive biases and task alignment.

Method: The method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through constrained optimization, creating the Soft-Binary-Argmax operator. This differentiable approximation preserves mathematical properties while enabling efficient Jacobian computation for integration into binary and multiclass learning systems.

Result: Empirically, the approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on output logits, narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training scenarios.

Conclusion: The Soft-Binary-Argmax operator successfully bridges the gap between the theoretical ideal of zero-one loss and practical gradient-based optimization, enabling better inductive biases and improved generalization performance, particularly in challenging large-batch training regimes.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have emphasized the integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, enabling richer inductive biases and tighter alignment with task-specific objectives. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss-long considered the gold standard for classification performance, yet incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. Our method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, leading to a new operator we term Soft-Binary-Argmax. After deriving its mathematical properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into binary and multiclass learning systems. Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.

*Alkis Kalavasis,Anay Mehrotra,Manolis Zampetakis,Felix Zhou,Ziyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper resolves two open questions about Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data: identifying when the mean is identifiable under convex partitions, and establishing computationally efficient estimation algorithms under these conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse data is common in real-world applications due to measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and system lags. Previous work showed that mean estimation from coarse data is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and partitions consist of convex sets, but became NP-hard without convexity. Two fundamental questions remained unresolved.

Method: The paper studies Gaussian mean estimation where true samples are drawn from a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but are only revealed through sets from a partition containing the sample. The focus is on understanding identifiability conditions for convex partitions and developing efficient estimation algorithms.

Result: The paper resolves both open questions: it characterizes when the mean is identifiable under convex partitions, and establishes that computationally efficient estimation is possible under identifiability and convex partitions.

Conclusion: The work provides a complete theoretical understanding of Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data with convex partitions, solving the identifiability question and establishing computational efficiency for estimation algorithms in this setting.

Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]

*Elad Kimchi Shoshani,Leeyam Gabay,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLADA eliminates pixel transmission by using pseudo-labels on preloaded reference datasets, requiring only class labels for task communication with <1 MB payload while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributing large datasets to diverse clients incurs massive communication costs, and transmitting pre-trained models is infeasible due to hardware/software diversity. Current dataset distillation methods struggle with high-resolution data and insufficient compression.

Method: PLADA assumes clients have preloaded generic unlabeled reference datasets (like ImageNet). Instead of transmitting pixel data, it sends only class labels for specific images. A pruning mechanism filters the reference dataset to retain only semantically relevant image labels for the target task, maximizing training efficiency while minimizing transmission.

Result: Experiments on 10 diverse datasets show PLADA can transfer task knowledge with payloads under 1 MB while maintaining high classification accuracy, outperforming traditional dataset serving methods.

Conclusion: PLADA offers a promising solution for efficient dataset serving by eliminating pixel transmission and using only label communication, addressing the scalability and bandwidth limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.

### [197] [Sustainable Multi-Agent Crowdsourcing via Physics-Informed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22365)
*Chayan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: FORGE introduces a physics-grounded multi-agent simulator with neural-linear UCB allocator that resolves the four-way tension in crowdsourcing by achieving high quality, low workforce utilization (7.6%), while preventing burnout and handling strategic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for crowdsourcing allocation face a four-way tension: they either achieve good Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout (greedy/MCDM methods), or prevent burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% utilization (bandit algorithms). No method simultaneously addresses quality, sustainability, feasibility, and strategic behavior.

Method: FORGE is a physics-grounded K+1 multi-agent simulator where contractors are rational agents declaring load-acceptance thresholds based on fatigue. The Neural-Linear UCB allocator combines a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior from offline simulator interactions, providing warm-started skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration from episode 1.

Result: Over 200 cold-start episodes, FORGE achieves the highest reward (LRew = 0.555 ± 0.041) among non-oracle methods at only 7.6% workforce utilization—no conventional baseline achieves this combination. It maintains robustness to 50% workforce turnover and observation noise up to σ = 0.20.

Conclusion: FORGE successfully resolves the four-way tension in crowdsourcing allocation by treating the problem as a Stackelberg game within a physics-grounded simulator, achieving superior quality-sustainability-feasibility tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Crowdsourcing platforms face a four-way tension between allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behaviour--a dilemma we formalise as the Cold-Start, Burnout, Utilisation, and Strategic Agency Dilemma. Existing methods resolve at most two of these tensions simultaneously: greedy heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods achieve Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout, while bandit algorithms eliminate burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% workforce utilisation.To address this, we introduce FORGE, a physics-grounded $K+1$ multi-agent simulator in which each contractor is a rational agent that declares its own load-acceptance threshold based on its fatigue state, converting the standard passive Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) into a genuine Stackelberg game. Operating within FORGE, we propose a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that fuses a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior derived from offline simulator interactions. The prior simultaneously warm-starts skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration landscape, providing a geometry-aware belief state from episode 1 that measurably reduces cold-start regret.Over $T = 200$ cold-start episodes, the proposed method achieves the highest reward of all non-oracle methods ($\text{LRew} = 0.555 \pm 0.041$) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation--a combination no conventional baseline achieves--while maintaining robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to $σ= 0.20$.

*Yuanjun Li,Bin Zhang,Hao Chen,Zhouyang Jiang,Dapeng Li,Zhiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: QSIM: A similarity-weighted Q-learning framework that addresses systematic Q-value overestimation in value decomposition MARL methods by reconstructing TD targets using action similarity instead of max operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value decomposition methods in cooperative MARL suffer from systematic Q-value overestimation due to their reliance on the max operator for TD target calculation. This issue is exacerbated in MARL by the combinatorial explosion of joint action spaces, leading to unstable learning and suboptimal policies.

Method: Proposes QSIM, which forms a similarity-weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space instead of using the greedy joint action directly. It reconstructs TD targets using action similarity, assigning greater influence to actions more similar to the greedy choice while integrating Q-values from diverse but behaviorally related actions.

Result: Extensive experiments show QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to original algorithms. Empirical analysis confirms QSIM significantly mitigates systematic value overestimation in MARL.

Conclusion: QSIM effectively addresses the overestimation problem in value decomposition MARL by smoothing TD targets with structurally relevant alternatives, improving learning stability and performance across multiple benchmark domains.

Abstract: Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphones present unique challenges for agentic systems due to constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states. As LLMs evolve from conversational assistants to action-oriented agents, achieving reliable smartphone-native autonomy requires new approaches to reasoning and control composition.

Method: ClawMobile adopts a hierarchical architecture that separates high-level language reasoning from structured, deterministic control pathways. This approach improves execution stability and reproducibility on real devices, with the system serving as a case study for mobile LLM runtime design principles.

Result: The paper uses ClawMobile as a case study to distill design principles for mobile LLM runtimes and identify key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability. The implementation is open-sourced to facilitate future exploration.

Conclusion: Building robust smartphone-native agentic systems demands principled coordination between probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces. The hierarchical separation of reasoning and control pathways provides a more stable approach for mobile autonomy.

Abstract: Smartphones represent a uniquely challenging environment for agentic systems. Unlike cloud or desktop settings, mobile devices combine constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states. As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants to action-oriented agents, achieving reliable smartphone-native autonomy requires rethinking how reasoning and control are composed.
  We introduce ClawMobile as a concrete exploration of this design space. ClawMobile adopts a hierarchical architecture that separates high-level language reasoning from structured, deterministic control pathways, improving execution stability and reproducibility on real devices. Using ClawMobile as a case study, we distill the design principles for mobile LLM runtimes and identify key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability. We argue that building robust smartphone-native agentic systems demands principled coordination between probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces.
