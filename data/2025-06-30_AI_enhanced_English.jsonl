However, the current\npractice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases\ninevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them\nprohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to\ndistill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics\npriors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable\nand naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into\nan implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional\nphysical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a\nphysics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to\nindoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic\nintegration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful\nfeatures from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic\nprogramming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a\nlow-level neural controller.
