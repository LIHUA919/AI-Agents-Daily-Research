When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction\nset of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high\nprobability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of\naudio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a\nuser study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat\nprediction sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hierarchical conformal classification (HCC) extends conformal prediction to incorporate class hierarchies, maintaining coverage guarantees while producing more structured and semantically meaningful prediction sets.", "motivation": "Standard conformal prediction treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels, which limits the usefulness of prediction sets.", "method": "Formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem that yields prediction sets composed of nodes at different hierarchy levels.

In this paper, we generalize the\nstandard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of\ntwo parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three\nexisting SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be\nunified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further\npropose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into\ndesigning the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class\ninformation of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is\nchallenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To\naddress this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and\ninter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship\nbetween anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called\nAdaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or\nfar from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further\naway from the anchor point in the feature space.
