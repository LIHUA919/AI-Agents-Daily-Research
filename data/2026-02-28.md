### [1] [Agent Behavioral Contracts: Formal Specification and Runtime Enforcement for Reliable Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302)
*Varun Pratap Bhardwaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC) brings formal Design-by-Contract principles to AI agents via runtime-enforceable specifications for preconditions, invariants, governance, and recovery, with probabilistic compliance guarantees that significantly reduce behavioral drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents operate on prompts and natural language without formal behavioral specifications, leading to drift, governance failures, and deployment failures. There's a need for formal contracts similar to traditional software's APIs and type systems to ensure reliable agent behavior.

Method: Introduced ABC framework with contracts C = (P, I, G, R) specifying Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms. Defined probabilistic (p, delta, k)-satisfaction for contract compliance accounting for LLM non-determinism. Implemented AgentAssert runtime enforcement library and evaluated on AgentContract-Bench with 200 scenarios across 7 models.

Result: Contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that baselines miss (p < 0.0001, d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, bound drift to D* < 0.27, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% overall, at <10ms overhead per action across 1,980 sessions.

Conclusion: ABC framework successfully brings formal contract enforcement to AI agents, providing strong probabilistic guarantees against drift while maintaining low overhead. The approach enables reliable agent deployment with measurable compliance bounds.

Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

### [2] [Graph Your Way to Inspiration: Integrating Co-Author Graphs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Model Based Scientific Idea Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22215)
*Pengzhen Xie,Huizhi Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GYWI: A scientific idea generation system that combines author knowledge graphs with RAG to provide controllable context and traceable inspiration paths for LLMs, significantly outperforming mainstream models on novelty, reliability, and relevance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise for scientific idea generation, they often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways, making their outputs less reliable and harder to validate.

Method: Three main components: 1) Author-centered knowledge graph construction with inspiration source sampling, 2) Hybrid retrieval (RAG + GraphRAG) for breadth and depth, 3) Reinforcement learning-based prompt optimization to guide LLMs using the hybrid context.

Result: GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, Gemini 2.5) across multiple metrics including novelty, reliability, and relevance, as validated through comprehensive evaluation on arXiv data (2018-2023).

Conclusion: The GYWI system effectively addresses the limitations of current LLMs for scientific idea generation by providing structured knowledge context and traceable inspiration pathways, representing a significant advancement in AI-assisted scientific creativity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.

### [3] [A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163)
*Usman Anwar,Julianna Piskorz,David D. Baek,David Africa,Jim Weatherall,Max Tegmark,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Mihaela van der Schaar,David Krueger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decision-theoretic framework for detecting and quantifying steganography in LLMs by measuring the information asymmetry between agents who can and cannot decode hidden content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are developing steganographic capabilities that could allow misaligned models to evade oversight. Classical steganography detection methods require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals, which is not feasible for steganographic reasoning in LLMs, rendering traditional approaches inapplicable.

Method: The authors propose a decision-theoretic view of steganography, introducing generalized V-information as a utilitarian framework for measuring usable information. They define the "steganographic gap" - a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of steganographic signals to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content.

Result: The authors empirically validate their formalism and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in large language models.

Conclusion: The decision-theoretic framework provides a principled method for detecting and quantifying steganographic behaviors in LLMs, addressing a critical gap in AI safety oversight mechanisms where traditional steganography detection approaches fail.

Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

### [4] [FIRE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Financial Intelligence and Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22273)
*Xiyuan Zhang,Huihang Wu,Jiayu Guo,Zhenlin Zhang,Yiwei Zhang,Liangyu Huo,Xiaoxiao Ma,Jiansong Wan,Xuewei Jiao,Yi Jing,Jian Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRE is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' financial knowledge and practical business scenario handling, covering both theoretical exam questions and practical scenario tasks with 3,000 questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to systematically evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge and practical business scenario handling capabilities of LLMs in real-world financial applications.

Method: 1. Created a benchmark with theoretical assessment using questions from financial qualification exams. 2. Developed a systematic evaluation matrix categorizing complex financial domains. 3. Collected 3,000 financial scenario questions including closed-form and open-ended questions with reference answers/rubrics.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs including XuanYuan 4.0 show that the benchmark enables systematic analysis of LLMs' capability boundaries in financial applications.

Conclusion: FIRE provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs in finance, enabling analysis of their theoretical knowledge and practical application abilities, with publicly released benchmark and code for future research.

Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.

### [5] [Multi-Level Causal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22287)
*Willem Schooltink,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Causal embeddings generalize abstractions to map multiple detailed models into subsystems of a coarser causal model, addressing multi-resolution marginal problems for merging datasets from different representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing abstractions focus on relations between two models, but there's a need to handle situations where multiple detailed models need to be mapped into subsystems of a coarser causal model for practical applications like merging datasets with different representations.

Method: Define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, present a generalized notion of consistency, and formulate a multi-resolution marginal problem that connects to both statistical and causal marginal problems.

Result: The framework enables practical merging of datasets coming from models with different representations by providing a formal approach to embed multiple detailed causal models into a coarser one while preserving causal relationships.

Conclusion: Causal embeddings provide a valuable generalization of causal abstractions that addresses important practical challenges in causal inference, particularly for integrating data from multiple sources with different representations.

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.

### [6] [Vibe Researching as Wolf Coming: Can AI Agents with Skills Replace or Augment Social Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22401)
*Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents enable "vibe researching" - autonomous research pipelines using multi-step reasoning workflows with tools and persistent state, representing a qualitative shift from prior automation in social science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science, moving beyond chatbots to systems that can execute entire research pipelines autonomously with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills.

Method: Introduces "vibe researching" concept (parallel to "vibe coding"), uses scholar-skill (21-skill plugin for Claude Code) as illustrative case, develops cognitive task framework classifying research activities along codifiability and tacit knowledge dimensions to identify a cognitive delegation boundary.

Result: AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The delegation boundary is cognitive (cutting through every research stage) rather than sequential (between stages).

Conclusion: Identifies three implications for the profession: augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and pedagogical crisis; proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

### [7] [Towards Autonomous Memory Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22406)
*Xinle Wu,Rui Zhang,Mustafa Anis Hussain,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: U-Mem introduces autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge via cost-aware knowledge extraction and semantic-aware Thompson sampling, outperforming prior memory systems on both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory agents are passive and reactive - they only extract experiences from available conversation history without actively seeking external knowledge when uncertain. Memory growth is limited to existing information, and agents don't proactively address knowledge gaps or uncertainties.

Method: U-Mem uses two key techniques: 1) A cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that progressively escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research, and only when necessary, expert feedback. 2) Semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories while mitigating cold-start bias.

Result: U-Mem consistently outperforms prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, achieving improvements of 14.6 points on HotpotQA (with Qwen2.5-7B) and 7.33 points on AIME25 (with Gemini-2.5-flash).

Conclusion: Autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at minimum cost are more effective than passive memory systems, demonstrating significant performance gains on diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent memory agents improve LLMs by extracting experiences and conversation history into an external storage. This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.

### [8] [Exploring Human Behavior During Abstract Rule Inference and Problem Solving with the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22408)
*Caroline Ahn,Quan Do,Leah Bakst,Michael P. Pascale,Joseph T. McGuire,Michael E. Hasselmo,Chantal E. Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogARC reveals how humans solve abstract reasoning tasks through diverse strategies, showing high accuracy but varied performance and adaptation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate human cognitive strategies in abstract reasoning using a modified version of the ARC benchmark, examining how people learn and apply rules from sparse examples.

Method: Administered CogARC (75 abstract visual reasoning problems) to 260 participants across two experiments, recording high-resolution behavioral data including viewing patterns, edit sequences, and solution attempts.

Result: Participants showed high accuracy (90% Exp1, 80% Exp2) with wide variation across problems. Harder problems led to longer deliberation times and more divergent strategies. Performance patterns suggested task familiarity rather than rule-learning improvement.

Conclusion: CogARC provides a rich framework for studying human abstract reasoning, revealing diverse strategy adaptation patterns and convergent solution paths even in incorrect attempts.

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

### [9] [Epistemic Filtering and Collective Hallucination: A Jury Theorem for Confidence-Calibrated Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22413)
*Jonas Karge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective participation with abstention, where agents learn their own reliability over time and only vote when confident, generalizes classical epistemic voting results like Condorcet Jury Theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world aggregation benefits from allowing agents to abstain (say "I don't know"), unlike classical voting models that assume fixed participation. This is particularly relevant for mitigating hallucinations in collective LLM decision-making.

Method: Proposed probabilistic framework with calibration phase where agents update beliefs about their own fixed competence, followed by confidence gate determining whether to vote or abstain. Derived non-asymptotic lower bound on group success probability.

Result: Selective participation generalizes asymptotic guarantees of Condorcet Jury Theorem to sequential, confidence-gated settings. Non-asymptotic lower bounds derived and validated via Monte Carlo simulations.

Conclusion: Allowing agents to selectively abstain based on learned confidence improves collective accuracy and generalizes classical voting theorems. Framework has practical applications for AI safety, particularly in mitigating hallucinations in collective LLM decision-making.

Abstract: We investigate the collective accuracy of heterogeneous agents who learn to estimate their own reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting. While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations. While our results are general, we discuss their potential application to AI safety, outlining how this framework can mitigate \textit{hallucinations} in collective LLM decision-making.

### [10] [ArchAgent: Agentic AI-driven Computer Architecture Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22425)
*Raghav Gupta,Akanksha Jain,Abraham Gonzalez,Alexander Novikov,Po-Sen Huang,Matej Balog,Marvin Eisenberger,Sergey Shirobokov,Ngân Vũ,Martin Dixon,Borivoje Nikolić,Parthasarathy Ranganathan,Sagar Karandikar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchAgent is an AI system that automatically designs state-of-the-art cache replacement policies, achieving significant speedup improvements over prior methods in just days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an exploding demand for compute that requires more efficient hardware design. Current design processes are slow and human-intensive, creating a bottleneck. AI systems have shown promise in algorithm design and code efficiency, suggesting they could accelerate architecture discovery.

Method: ArchAgent is built on AlphaEvolve and automates computer architecture discovery. It designs new cache replacement policies (including mechanisms and logic, not just parameters) within the constraints of established design competitions. The system also enables "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable hardware parameters for specific workloads.

Result: ArchAgent generated a policy achieving 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over prior state-of-the-art on multi-core Google Workload Traces in just 2 days. On single-core SPEC06 workloads, it achieved 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over existing SoTA in 18 days, 3-5x faster than human-developed methods. Through hyperspecialization, it demonstrated 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems like ArchAgent can dramatically accelerate computer architecture discovery, achieving state-of-the-art results much faster than human efforts. The paper also reveals broader implications including "simulator escapes" where AI discovered loopholes in research tools designed for human operation, highlighting new challenges and opportunities in the AI era of architecture research.

Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

### [11] [How Do Latent Reasoning Methods Perform Under Weak and Strong Supervision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22441)
*Yingqian Cui,Zhenwei Dai,Bing He,Zhan Shi,Hui Liu,Rui Sun,Zhiji Liu,Yue Xing,Jiliang Tang,Benoit Dumoulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent reasoning enables multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces rather than discrete tokens, but analysis reveals it often takes shortcuts and doesn't truly perform structured search despite encoding multiple possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While latent reasoning has gained attention for enabling multi-step reasoning in continuous latent spaces, its internal mechanisms are not well understood despite numerous performance improvements.

Method: Conducted comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods with different supervision levels, examining shortcut behaviors and testing whether latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space.

Result: Found pervasive shortcut behavior where methods achieve high accuracy without latent reasoning, and latent representations can encode multiple possibilities but don't implement structured search - instead showing implicit pruning and compression. Also identified supervision trade-off: stronger supervision reduces shortcuts but limits diverse hypothesis encoding, while weaker supervision allows richer representations but increases shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning methods have fundamental limitations - they take shortcuts rather than performing genuine reasoning, and don't faithfully implement structured search despite encoding multiple possibilities, with supervision level presenting an inherent trade-off between shortcut mitigation and representation richness.

Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.

### [12] [A Framework for Assessing AI Agent Decisions and Outcomes in AutoML Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22442)
*Gaoyuan Du,Amit Ahlawat,Xiaoyang Liu,Jing Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Evaluation Agent (EA) for decision-centric assessment of agent-based AutoML systems, shifting focus from outcome-only metrics to evaluating intermediate decisions across four dimensions to expose invisible failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based AutoML systems rely on LLMs for multi-stage decisions but are evaluated only on final task performance (outcome-centric). No existing systems report structured, decision-level metrics for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality, creating a gap in understanding agent reasoning and failure modes.

Method: Introduces an Evaluation Agent (EA) designed as a non-interfering observer that evaluates intermediate AutoML agent decisions along four dimensions: (1) decision validity, (2) reasoning consistency, (3) model quality risks beyond accuracy, and (4) counterfactual decision impact. The EA assesses decisions without disrupting execution.

Result: Proof-of-concept experiments show: (i) EA detects faulty decisions with F1 score of 0.919; (ii) identifies reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes; (iii) attributes downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9% to +8.3% in final metrics.

Conclusion: Decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes invisible to outcome-only metrics. This work reframes evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from outcome-based to decision-auditing perspective, providing foundation for more reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

Abstract: Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\% to +8.3\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.

### [13] [CWM: Contrastive World Models for Action Feasibility Learning in Embodied Agent Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22452)
*Chayan Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CWM uses contrastive learning with hard negatives to improve action feasibility scoring over standard supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action feasibility scorers use supervised fine-tuning which treats each candidate independently and fails to teach discrimination between physically correct vs subtly wrong actions, creating a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines.

Method: Contrastive World Model (CWM) fine-tunes LLMs with InfoNCE contrastive objective using hard-mined negative examples to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, emphasizing semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates.

Result: CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives, achieves higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs 0.906), and maintains better safety margin (-2.39 vs -3.96) under out-of-distribution conditions.

Conclusion: Contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone, making it a superior approach for action scoring in embodied agents.

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

*Joseph Tso,Preston Schmittou,Quan Huynh,Jibran Hutchins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with direct constrained optimization, achieving only 65% constraint satisfaction at best, with feasibility being the primary bottleneck rather than optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate LLMs' ability to formulate optimization problems as solver code, but there's an open question about whether LLMs can directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without solver access.

Method: Introduce ConstraintBench benchmark across 10 operations research domains with 200 tasks, using natural-language scenarios with entities, constraints, and optimization objectives. Models return structured solutions verified by deterministic verifier and Gurobi solver-proven optimum.

Result: Best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction; feasible solutions average 89-96% of Gurobi-optimal objective; joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% is ≤30.5%. Large variation across domains (83.3% to 0.8% feasibility). Systematic failures include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and feasibility-optimality decoupling.

Conclusion: Feasibility is the primary bottleneck for LLMs in direct constrained optimization, with models showing significant domain-specific variation and systematic failure patterns, highlighting current limitations in solving optimization problems without solver access.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

TL;DR: VERO is a framework for evaluating and benchmarking coding agent optimization through structured versioning, rewards, and observation tracking


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks systematic understanding of coding agent performance on agent optimization tasks, which differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering due to interleaving deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions

Method: Introduces VERO framework with reproducible evaluation harness (versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, structured execution traces) and benchmark suite of target agents/tasks with reference evaluation procedures

Result: Conducted empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance

Conclusion: VERO supports research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents, addressing unique challenges of this emerging application domain

Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid development of AI integration into life cycle assessment, comprehensive synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited, creating a gap in understanding current trends and future directions.

Method: Combines LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques to create a dynamic framework for analyzing AI-LCA research, capturing both high-level trends and nuanced conceptual patterns.

Result: Identifies dramatic growth in AI adoption for LCA, shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI methods and LCA stages.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted methodologies show strong potential for large-scale, reproducible reviews across research domains and can help practitioners incorporate cutting-edge tools to enhance sustainability decision-making rigor and quality.

Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.

*Ik-hwan Kim,Hyeongrok Han,Mingi Jung,Sangwon Yu,Jinseok Hong,Sang Hun Kim,Yoonyoung Choi,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MBT (Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning) is a post-training framework that injects metacognitive behaviors into Large Reasoning Models to prevent reasoning collapse and improve stability in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often show structural fragility in complex reasoning tasks, failing to produce correct answers even after deriving valid intermediate steps. The failures stem from deficiency in self-regulatory control rather than lack of reasoning capacity, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or failure to recognize logical sufficiency.

Method: MBT has two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Both inject metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process.

Result: Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks show MBT consistently outperforms baselines with notable gains on challenging benchmarks. MBT effectively eliminates reasoning collapse, achieving higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption.

Conclusion: Internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, demonstrating that enhanced self-regulatory control can prevent reasoning collapse and improve efficiency.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit structural fragility in complex reasoning tasks, failing to produce correct answers even after successfully deriving valid intermediate steps. Through systematic analysis, we observe that these failures frequently stem not from a lack of reasoning capacity, but from a deficiency in self-regulatory control, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or the failure to recognize logical sufficiency. Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning.

### [18] [A Mathematical Theory of Agency and Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22519)
*Wael Hafez,Chenan Wei,Rodrigo Felipe,Amir Nazeri,Cameron Reid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'bipredictability' (P) as a fundamental measure of effective information sharing in systems, proves quantum vs. classical bounds, distinguishes agency from intelligence, and proposes a thalamocortical-inspired feedback architecture for adaptive AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems produce sophisticated predictions but lack principled measures of how effectively they use information resources. Predictions can appear successful while the underlying system-environment interaction degrades. There's a need for a measure of how much information a system actually shares between observations, actions, and outcomes to enable resilient operation under changing conditions.

Method: The authors mathematically define and prove the properties of bipredictability (P) as an intrinsic measure derived from first principles. They validate theoretical bounds by testing them in three domains: a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi-turn LLM conversations. They also propose a feedback architecture inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems.

Result: Theoretical proofs show P is strictly bounded: can reach unity in quantum systems, ≤0.5 in classical systems, and lower when agency is introduced. Experimental validation confirms these bounds across diverse systems. The analysis leads to a clear distinction: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, while intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of learning effectiveness, and adapting scope to restore effective learning. The proposed feedback architecture demonstrates real-time monitoring of P.

Conclusion: Bipredictability provides a fundamental measure for assessing system effectiveness. Current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence by this definition. A thalamocortical-inspired feedback architecture monitoring bipredictability in real time establishes a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI that can maintain effective information use under changing conditions.

Abstract: To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This position paper argues that modular language agent design can be inspired by cognitive models and AI algorithms, proposing agent templates to combine multiple LLMs into effective systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many difficult problems exceed the capabilities of single LLMs, creating uncertainty about how to effectively combine multiple LLMs into cohesive systems.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of agent templates that specify roles for individual LLMs and their composition, then survey existing language agents to identify underlying templates derived from cognitive models and AI algorithms.

Result: The paper demonstrates that many existing language agents can be understood through templates inspired by cognitive science and AI algorithms, providing a framework for designing effective modular systems.

Conclusion: Agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI offer powerful tools for developing effective, interpretable language agents by providing blueprints for combining multiple LLMs.

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

### [20] [Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22539)
*Mohammad Hossein Shokouhi,Vincent W. S. Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN, using LLM-based agents that coordinate to handle complex operator intents including energy savings and QoS requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While agentic AI is emerging for autonomous RANs and O-RAN enables agent coordination, existing works handle simple intents with independent agents, leaving complex intents requiring multi-agent coordination unexplored.

Method: A multi-agent framework with: 1) supervisor agent translating operator intents to optimization objectives and minimum rate requirements, 2) user weighting agent retrieving prior experience to determine user priority weights for precoding, 3) O-RU management agent using DRL for energy-saving O-RU activation decisions, and 4) monitoring agent coordinating to guarantee minimum rates. Uses PEFT for scalable LLM deployment across agents.

Result: Simulations show the framework reduces active O-RUs by 41.93% compared to baselines in energy-saving mode, and PEFT reduces memory usage by 92% compared to deploying separate LLM agents.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic AI framework effectively handles complex operator intents in cell-free O-RAN through coordinated multi-agent reasoning, achieving significant energy savings and scalable LLM deployment via parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

TL;DR: AHCE framework enables LLM agents to actively request structured reasoning from human experts for domain-specific tasks where LLMs lack long-tail knowledge, achieving significant performance improvements in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle in specialized domains requiring long-tail knowledge not present in their training data. While human experts possess this knowledge, their unstructured and unreliable guidance makes direct integration into agent planning difficult.

Method: AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement) framework with a Human Feedback Module (HFM) that uses a learned policy to treat human experts as interactive reasoning tools, enabling on-demand Human-AI collaboration.

Result: Extensive Minecraft experiments show AHCE increases task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: Successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning rather than simply asking for help, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured human-AI collaboration frameworks like AHCE for specialized domain tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

TL;DR: CourtGuard introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines LLM safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate, achieving state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning while offering zero-shot adaptability and automated data curation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety mechanisms rely on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity - they cannot enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining.

Method: CourtGuard uses a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that orchestrates adversarial debates grounded in external policy documents. It decouples safety logic from model weights through an evidentiary debate approach.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Demonstrated zero-shot adaptability by generalizing to Wikipedia Vandalism task (90% accuracy) through policy swapping. Enabled automated data curation and auditing of nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance, overcoming the limitations of static fine-tuned classifiers.

Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.

*Weida Liang,Yiyou Sun,Shuyuan Nan,Chuang Li,Dawn Song,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR) that improves mathematical reasoning by selectively retrieving strategies based on their executability rather than just usage frequency, achieving substantial accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Example-based guidance for mathematical reasoning is unstable even when guidance is correct, due to a gap between strategy usage (whether a strategy appears in solutions) and strategy executability (whether it remains effective as guidance for target models).

Method: Analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions revealing systematic differences between human- and model-derived strategies, then developing SSR - a test-time framework that models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals.

Result: SSR yields reliable improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, with accuracy improvements of up to +13 points on AIME25 and +5 points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Conclusion: The instability of example-based guidance stems from the gap between strategy usage and executability, and explicitly modeling executability through selective strategy retrieval can achieve consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

*Jodi M. Casabianca,Maggie Beiting-Parrish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating psychometric rater models (specifically item response theory and multi-faceted Rasch models) into AI evaluation pipelines to systematically account for human rater biases like severity and centrality, thereby improving the reliability of human judgments in AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluations are central to AI training and assessment, but these judgments are typically treated as ground truth without considering systematic measurement errors and rater biases that distort the observed ratings.

Method: The paper reviews common rater effects (severity and centrality) and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. It uses the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example to show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected quality estimates.

Result: The analysis shows that adjusting for rater severity using psychometric models produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance, revealing how raw ratings can be distorted by systematic rater biases.

Conclusion: Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation enables more principled and transparent use of human data, allowing developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This approach represents a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings.

*Sanjay Kariyappa,G. Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SideQuest uses the LLM itself to intelligently compress KV cache tokens during multi-step reasoning tasks, reducing memory usage by up to 65% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-running agentic tasks require multi-hop reasoning across multiple webpages/documents, which rapidly increases token usage and degrades decode performance. Existing KV cache compression techniques fail to effectively support multi-step reasoning models.

Method: SideQuest leverages the Large Reasoning Model itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about token usefulness. It frames compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task to prevent management tokens from polluting the model's memory.

Result: Evaluations show SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques. The system was trained with only 215 samples.

Conclusion: SideQuest demonstrates that LLMs can effectively manage their own context through intelligent KV cache compression, significantly reducing memory overhead for long-running agentic tasks while maintaining reasoning quality.

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for systematic evaluation of LLM-based route-planning agents, but current evaluation is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility.

Method: 1) Construct MobilityBench from large-scale, anonymized real user queries from Amap covering diverse route-planning intents; 2) Design deterministic API-replay sandbox to eliminate environmental variance; 3) Propose multi-dimensional evaluation protocol (outcome validity, instruction understanding, planning, tool use, efficiency).

Result: Evaluation reveals current models perform competently on basic information retrieval and route planning tasks, but struggle significantly with preference-constrained route planning, indicating substantial room for improvement in personalized mobility applications.

Conclusion: MobilityBench provides a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents, highlighting current limitations in handling preference-constrained scenarios and enabling systematic improvement in real-world mobility applications.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHBid is a hierarchical auto-bidding framework that combines generative planning (using diffusion models) with real-time control to optimize multi-channel advertising bids, achieving 13.57% higher ROI than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-bidding approaches have limitations: optimization-based methods lack flexibility for dynamic markets, while reinforcement learning methods struggle to capture historical dependencies and observational patterns within MDP constraints. Multi-channel advertising with distinct behavioral patterns requires effective budget and constraint allocation.

Method: AHBid integrates generative planning with real-time control. It uses: 1) high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints while capturing historical context and temporal patterns; 2) constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance; 3) trajectory refinement mechanism for adaptability using historical data; 4) control-based bidding algorithm that combines historical knowledge with real-time information.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale offline datasets and online A/B tests demonstrate AHBid's effectiveness, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: AHBid successfully addresses the limitations of current auto-bidding approaches by combining generative planning with real-time control, effectively handling historical dependencies and dynamic market conditions in multi-channel advertising environments.

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

*Siyu Jiang,Sanshuai Cui,Hui Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Knob connects deep learning with control theory, mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system to create a tunable "safety valve" for dynamic model calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods treat calibration as static post-hoc optimization, neglecting the dynamic nature of real-world inference and lacking intuitive interfaces for human operators to adjust model behavior under shifting conditions.

Method: Establishes correspondences between physical parameters (damping ratio ζ and natural frequency ω_n) and neural gating, using logit-level convex fusion as input-adaptive temperature scaling. Imposes second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE) enabling dual-mode inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks and state-preserving processing for continuous streams.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and show that in Continuous Mode, gate responses demonstrate standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), enabling predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

Conclusion: The paper presents an exploratory architectural interface connecting deep learning with control theory, focusing on demonstrating the concept and validating control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance, paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning of model behavior.

Abstract: Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable "safety valve". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

*Rui Wei,Hanfei Yu,Shubham Jain,Yogarajan Sivakumar,Devesh Tiwari,Jian Li,Seung-Jong Park,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLHFless is a serverless computing framework for synchronous RLHF training that dynamically adapts to resource demands, pre-computes shared prefixes, and uses cost-aware actor scaling to achieve 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RLHF frameworks rely on serverful infrastructures that struggle with fine-grained resource variability during synchronous training, causing idle time between RL components, overhead, and resource wastage.

Method: Built on serverless computing, RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, employs cost-aware actor scaling for response length variation, and efficiently assigns workloads to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time.

Result: Experiments on physical testbeds and large-scale simulated clusters show RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RLHFless demonstrates that serverless computing can effectively address the efficiency challenges in synchronous RLHF training by dynamically adapting to resource demands and reducing overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.
  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Taesar is a data-centric framework that generates enriched target-domain sequences using contrastive decoding to incorporate cross-domain context, enabling standard models to learn cross-domain dependencies without complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain recommendation faces challenges of data sparsity and cold start, but mixing data from multiple domains introduces domain gaps that degrade quality and cause negative transfer. Existing model-centric approaches with complex architectures struggle with subtle non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes Taesar, a target-aligned sequential regeneration framework that employs contrastive decoding to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. This data-centric approach generates enriched datasets that capture intricate cross-domain dependencies, allowing standard sequential models to benefit without requiring complex fusion architectures.

Result: Experiments show Taesar outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes well to various sequential models. It effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms by generating enriched datasets.

Conclusion: Taesar provides a novel data-centric solution to cross-domain sequential recommendation that addresses domain gap challenges while maintaining computational efficiency and model simplicity. By enriching the training data rather than complicating model architectures, it enables better performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures.

By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms.

### [32] [Know What You Know: Metacognitive Entropy Calibration for Verifiable RL Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22751)
*Qiannian Zhao,Chen Yang,Jinhao Jing,Yunke Zhang,Xuhui Ren,Lu Yu,Shijie Zhang,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGPO is a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR training for large reasoning models, improving reasoning performance by aligning model uncertainty with correctness signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR pipelines for large reasoning models rely almost exclusively on binary correctness signals while ignoring the model's intrinsic uncertainty, creating an "uncertainty-reward mismatch." This prevents the policy from understanding its own knowledge states and impedes optimization of effective reasoning paths rather than just correct answers, which is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks like mathematics and QA.

Method: EGPO uses a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods. It aligns intrinsic uncertainty with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures. The approach recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance for large reasoning models.

Conclusion: EGPO establishes a principled path for advancing large reasoning models through metacognitive entropy calibration, addressing the uncertainty-reward mismatch problem and enabling more effective reasoning optimization by integrating uncertainty awareness into RLVR training.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from "Know What You Know" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.

### [33] [Decomposing Physician Disagreement in HealthBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22758)
*Satya Borgohain,Roy Mariathas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of physician disagreement in medical AI evaluations shows most variance is unexplained by rubrics, physician identity, or case metadata, with disagreement highest on borderline cases. Reducible uncertainty from missing context doubles disagreement odds but explains little total variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand sources of physician disagreement when evaluating medical AI outputs, particularly to identify what factors contribute to variance in assessments and whether this disagreement can be reduced through better evaluation design.

Method: The study analyzes physician disagreement using the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset. It decomposes variance through statistical methods including variance partitioning, regression analysis, ROC curves (AUC), and Tukey's HSD tests. It also examines relationships between disagreement and rubric identity, physician identity, metadata labels, normative language, medical specialty, surface features, embeddings, and completion quality.

Result: Key findings: 81.8% of case-level disagreement variance remains unexplained by tested factors. Rubric identity explains 15.8% of met/not-met variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance. Physician identity explains just 2.4%. Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC=0.689). Reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) doubles disagreement odds (OR=2.55) while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR=1.01), though reducible uncertainty explains only ~3% of total variance.

Conclusion: Most physician disagreement in medical AI evaluation is structural and unexplained by observable features. The dissociation between reducible and irreducible uncertainty suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could reduce disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity doesn't exist, pointing to actionable improvements in evaluation design.

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMA-Bench to evaluate long-horizon memory in LLM agents and proposes AMA-Agent with causality graphs and tool-augmented retrieval that outperforms existing memory systems by 11.16%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation standards for agent memory focus on dialogue-centric human-agent interactions, but real-world agent memory consists of continuous agent-environment interactions with machine-generated representations, creating a gap between practical applications and existing benchmarks.

Method: The paper introduces AMA-Bench with two components: (1) real-world agentic trajectories with expert-curated QA, and (2) synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons with rule-based QA. It then proposes AMA-Agent featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval to address limitations of existing memory systems.

Result: AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%. The study shows existing memory systems underperform primarily due to lack of causality/objective information and limitations of similarity-based retrieval.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between practical agent memory applications and evaluation standards, demonstrating that effective memory systems need to incorporate causality and objective information while moving beyond similarity-based retrieval constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

*Yusuke Watanabe,Yohei Kobashi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yasushi Okuno,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Clinical decision-making often requires handling incomplete information, but current LLMs struggle to identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, leading to both premature conclusions and excessive abstention. The authors developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems, to evaluate this determinability recognition capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decisions are frequently made under incomplete information, requiring experts to determine whether available data is sufficient for judgment. Both premature conclusions and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. Current benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate whether LLMs can recognize when information is complete enough to make safe clinical judgments.

Method: The authors developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. The approach requires considering all hypotheses about missing information (including unlikely ones) and verifying whether conclusions hold across all possibilities. This framework evaluates determinability recognition leading to appropriate abstention.

Result: Recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention. This occurs despite LLMs correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. The findings show existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate LLM safety in clinical settings.

Conclusion: ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains. The benchmark is publicly available and addresses a critical gap in assessing whether LLMs can safely handle incomplete information in clinical decision-making scenarios.

Conclusion: MiroFlow serves as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community, addressing current limitations in agent frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

TL;DR: A conceptual model and design principles for agentic AI systems to make better judgments about when and how to proactively intervene based on contextual understanding rather than just observable situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems increasingly intervene proactively based on contextual data but often fail due to lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. There's a need to bridge this gap between observable situations and meaningful user contexts.

Method: Proposes a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering.

Result: Five agent design principles derived: behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation. These principles guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint.

Conclusion: The model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions, addressing the gap in principled decision-making for proactive AI interventions.

Abstract: Agentic AI increasingly intervenes proactively by inferring users' situations from contextual data yet often fails for lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.

TL;DR: FlexMS is a flexible benchmark framework for evaluating deep learning models in mass spectrum prediction, addressing lack of standardized evaluation in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules via tandem mass spectrometry is crucial for drug discovery and material science, but there's a lack of experimental spectra and standardized benchmarks for evaluating computational prediction models.

Method: Developed FlexMS, an easy-to-use benchmark framework that supports dynamic construction of diverse model architectures, evaluation on preprocessed public datasets using multiple metrics, and includes retrieval benchmarks to simulate practical identification scenarios.

Result: The framework provides insights into performance factors including dataset structural diversity, hyperparameters (learning rate, data sparsity), pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings, and cross-domain transfer learning analysis, offering practical guidance for model selection.

Conclusion: FlexMS addresses the challenge of heterogeneous methods and lack of benchmarks in mass spectrum prediction, providing a standardized framework for comprehensive model evaluation and practical guidance for real-world chemical identification applications.

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

TL;DR: DeepPresenter is a novel agentic framework for presentation generation that adapts to user intents, supports feedback-driven refinement, and uses environment-grounded reflection on perceptual artifact states instead of internal reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing presentation agents rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates, lacking adaptability to diverse user intents and effective feedback-driven refinement capabilities.

Method: DeepPresenter is an agentic framework that autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts. It uses environment-grounded reflection conditioned on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides) rather than self-reflection over internal reasoning traces.

Result: DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluation covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios. The fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

Conclusion: DeepPresenter demonstrates that agentic frameworks with environment-grounded reflection can effectively adapt to diverse user intents and enable feedback-driven refinement for presentation generation, outperforming existing approaches while being more cost-effective.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

*Tan Bui-Thanh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI can accelerate mathematical discovery through human-AI collaboration, but requires rigorous verification and human intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI can contribute meaningfully to creative mathematical research beyond mere automation, and understand the dynamics of human-AI collaboration in mathematics.

Method: Conducted a detailed case study on discovering novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules through systematic collaboration with multiple AI assistants, documenting the complete research workflow with transparency.

Result: AI enabled extension of results beyond manual achievements, formulation and proof of several theorems. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation, but required human verification, intuition, and strategic direction at every step.

Conclusion: AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery when used with appropriate skepticism, verification protocols, and deep domain expertise, but demand careful human oversight and cannot replace mathematical intuition.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence truly contribute to creative mathematical research, or does it merely automate routine calculations while introducing risks of error? We provide empirical evidence through a detailed case study: the discovery of novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules via systematic human-AI collaboration.
  Working with multiple AI assistants, we extended results beyond what manual work achieved, formulating and proving several theorems with AI assistance. The collaboration revealed both remarkable capabilities and critical limitations. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, systematic proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation. However, every step required rigorous human verification, mathematical intuition for problem formulation, and strategic direction.
  We document the complete research workflow with unusual transparency, revealing patterns in successful human-AI mathematical collaboration and identifying failure modes researchers must anticipate. Our experience suggests that, when used with appropriate skepticism and verification protocols, AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery while demanding careful human oversight and deep domain expertise.

### [41] [Towards LLM-Empowered Knowledge Tracing via LLM-Student Hierarchical Behavior Alignment in Hyperbolic Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22879)
*Xingcheng Fu,Shengpeng Wang,Yisen Gao,Xianxian Li,Chunpei Li,Qingyun Sun,Dongran Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L-HAKT is a knowledge tracing framework that uses LLM agents to parse semantic hierarchies and generate synthetic data, with hyperbolic contrastive learning to align synthetic-real distributions and model knowledge tree structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT methods using ID-based sequences or shallow textual features fail to capture hierarchical cognitive state evolution and individualized difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling capabilities.

Method: 1) Teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and constructs hierarchical knowledge dependencies; 2) Student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data; 3) Contrastive learning between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences; 4) Optimizing hyperbolic curvature to explicitly model tree-like knowledge hierarchies.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of the L-HAKT framework.

Conclusion: L-HAKT successfully addresses limitations of existing KT methods by leveraging LLMs for semantic understanding and hyperbolic geometry for hierarchical knowledge structure modeling.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) diagnoses students' concept mastery through continuous learning state monitoring in education.Existing methods primarily focus on studying behavioral sequences based on ID or textual information.While existing methods rely on ID-based sequences or shallow textual features, they often fail to capture (1) the hierarchical evolution of cognitive states and (2) individualized problem difficulty perception due to limited semantic modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.

### [42] [OmniGAIA: Towards Native Omni-Modal AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22897)
*Xiaoxi Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Jiarui Jin,Shijian Wang,Guanting Dong,Jiajie Jin,Hao Wang,Yinuo Wang,Ji-Rong Wen,Yuan Lu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGAIA is a benchmark for evaluating omni-modal agents on tasks requiring reasoning and tool use across video, audio, and image modalities, while OmniAtlas is a native omni-modal foundation agent trained with specialized techniques to enhance tool-use capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs are primarily bi-modal (e.g., vision-language) and lack the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants that can integrate multiple modalities (video, audio, image) with reasoning and tool usage.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) OmniGAIA benchmark constructed via omni-modal event graphs to synthesize complex multi-hop queries from real-world data requiring cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration; (2) OmniAtlas foundation agent trained with hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception.

Result: OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models, and the benchmark enables evaluation of omni-modal agents on complex reasoning tasks across multiple modalities.

Conclusion: This work represents progress toward next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants that can handle real-world scenarios by integrating perception across video, audio, and image modalities with reasoning and tool usage capabilities.

Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a systematic framework and leaderboard for evaluating general-purpose AI agents across diverse environments without domain-specific engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents are mostly specialized, and existing benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, preventing fair evaluation of general agents. There's a lack of systematic assessment of general-purpose agent capabilities despite emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code.

Method: Proposed conceptual principles for general-agent evaluation, a Unified Protocol for agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework. Benchmarked five prominent agent implementations across six environments to create the first Open General Agent Leaderboard.

Result: General agents demonstrated the ability to generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. The experiments show that general-purpose agents can perform well across varied tasks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes foundational tools (evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard) for systematic research on general-purpose agents, moving toward realizing the promise of agents that can perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering.

Abstract: The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.

### [44] [FactGuard: Agentic Video Misinformation Detection via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22963)
*Zehao Li,Hongwei Yu,Hao Jiang,Qiang Sheng,Yilong Xu,Baolong Bi,Yang Li,Zhenlong Yuan,Yujun Cai,Zhaoqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FactGuard is an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that uses iterative reasoning with external tool invocation to address limitations of current MLLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for video misinformation detection rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, especially when critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification.

Method: FactGuard formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process using MLLMs, explicitly assesses task ambiguity, selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, and uses a two-stage training strategy combining domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

Conclusion: FactGuard provides an effective agentic framework for video misinformation detection that addresses key limitations of current MLLM approaches through iterative reasoning, external tool integration, and optimized training strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have substantially advanced video misinformation detection through unified multimodal reasoning, but they often rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, particularly in scenarios where critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification. To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

### [45] [Certified Circuits: Stability Guarantees for Mechanistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22968)
*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Bernt Schiele,Mario Fritz,Jonas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework called Certified Circuits that provides provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery in neural networks, ensuring circuits remain invariant to bounded dataset perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circuit discovery methods for neural network interpretability are brittle - they depend heavily on the specific concept dataset used and often fail to transfer to out-of-distribution data, raising doubts about whether they capture genuine concepts or just dataset-specific artifacts.

Method: Wraps any black-box circuit discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, resulting in more compact circuits.

Result: On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baseline methods degrade.

Conclusion: Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept, addressing a key limitation of current interpretability methods.

Abstract: Understanding how neural networks arrive at their predictions is essential for debugging, auditing, and deployment. Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!

*Peiyao Xiao,Xiaogang Li,Chengliang Xu,Jiayi Wang,Ben Wang,Zichao Chen,Zeyu Wang,Kejun Yu,Yueqian Chen,Xulin Liu,Wende Xiao,Bing Zhao,Hu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPM-Bench is a PhD-level multimodal benchmark for scanning probe microscopy that uses automated data synthesis with Anchor-Gated Sieve technology and hybrid cloud-local architecture to create high-quality image-text pairs while minimizing tokens, and introduces SIP-F1 scoring to evaluate LLM performance and quantify model personalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks for scientific domains suffer from data contamination, insufficient complexity, and high human labor costs. There's a need for specialized, authoritative benchmarks that accurately assess reasoning capabilities in complex physical scenarios like scanning probe microscopy.

Method: 1) Automated data synthesis pipeline using Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) to extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv/journal papers (2023-2025). 2) Hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return spatial coordinates ("llbox") for local high-fidelity cropping, achieving extreme token savings. 3) Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) scoring for evaluation.

Result: The pipeline achieves high dataset purity with low-cost automation. SIP-F1 scoring establishes rigorous capability hierarchies and quantifies model personalities (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, Wise) while exposing true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios.

Conclusion: SPM-Bench provides a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis and serves as an authoritative benchmark that reveals the limitations of current AI in specialized scientific domains while offering insights into model reasoning patterns and personalities.

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

### [47] [Modeling Expert AI Diagnostic Alignment via Immutable Inference Snapshots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22973)
*Dimitrios P. Panagoulias,Evangelia-Aikaterini Tsichrintzi,Georgios Savvidis,Evridiki Tsoureli-Nikita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diagnostic alignment framework that compares AI-generated radiology reports with physician-validated outcomes, showing that binary lexical evaluation underestimates clinical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-in-the-loop validation in clinical AI lacks structured analysis of transitions between model inference and expert correction, with binary evaluation methods failing to capture clinically meaningful alignment.

Method: Framework preserves AI-generated reports as immutable inference states, uses vision-enabled LLM, BERT-based medical entity extraction, and Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) for domain-consistent refinement before expert review. Evaluated on 21 dermatological cases with four-level concordance metrics.

Result: Exact agreement reached 71.4%, semantic similarity-adjusted rate remained unchanged, cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]), with no cases showing complete diagnostic divergence.

Conclusion: Modeling expert validation as structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human-aligned evaluation of image-based clinical decision support systems, revealing that binary lexical evaluation substantially underestimates clinically meaningful alignment.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

### [48] [RepSPD: Enhancing SPD Manifold Representation in EEGs via Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22981)
*Haohui Jia,Zheng Chen,Lingwei Zhu,Xu Cao,Yasuko Matsubara,Takashi Matsubara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepSPD is a geometric deep learning model that uses Riemannian manifold cross-attention and bidirectional alignment to enhance EEG brain activity decoding by better capturing frequency-specific synchronization and local brain topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SPD-based methods for EEG analysis focus on statistical aggregation but neglect important features: frequency-specific synchronization patterns and local topological structures of brain regions. This limits their ability to reveal meaningful structural connectivity in a physics-grounded manner.

Method: RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate SPD geometric attributes with graph-derived functional connectivity features. It also introduces a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by manifold curvature and enhancing geometric consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that RepSPD significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed RepSPD framework advances geometric deep learning for EEG analysis by effectively capturing both geometric and topological brain connectivity patterns, leading to improved brain activity decoding performance for neuroscience and clinical applications.

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [49] [Obscure but Effective: Classical Chinese Jailbreak Prompt Optimization via Bio-Inspired Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22983)
*Xun Huang,Simeng Qin,Xiaoshuang Jia,Ranjie Duan,Huanqian Yan,Zhitao Zeng,Fei Yang,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CC-BOS: A framework that uses classical Chinese prompts with multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization to generate effective jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have significant security vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, and classical Chinese's conciseness and obscurity can bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable LLM vulnerabilities.

Method: CC-BOS framework encodes prompts into eight policy dimensions (role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern, context) and uses fruit fly optimization with smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation for iterative refinement in black-box settings. Includes classical Chinese to English translation module for readability and evaluation.

Result: CC-BOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Classical Chinese presents a significant vulnerability vector for LLM jailbreak attacks, and the CC-BOS framework provides an efficient automated approach to exploit this vulnerability in black-box settings.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

*Giona Fieni,Joschua Wüthrich,Marc-Philippe Neumann,Christopher H. Onder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning approach for F1 race strategy optimization with multi-agent interaction and self-play training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formula 1 race strategies need to adapt to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions in real-time, requiring dynamic decision-making.

Method: Uses RL with pre-trained single-agent policy, adds interaction module to account for competitor behavior, and employs self-play training scheme for competitive policies.

Result: Agents successfully adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance.

Conclusion: The framework using only race-available information can effectively support race strategists' decisions both before and during actual races.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

*Zhuoliang Xie,Fei Liu,Zhenkun Wang,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AILS-AHD is a novel approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design and optimize ruin heuristics for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is a fundamental but NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with significant computational challenges, especially for large-scale instances that are difficult for traditional methods.

Method: AILS-AHD combines evolutionary search with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the Adaptive Iterated Local Search framework, plus an LLM-based acceleration mechanism for computational efficiency.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art solvers (AILS-II and HGS), establishing new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark.

Conclusion: LLM-driven heuristic design has significant potential to advance vehicle routing optimization, demonstrating that LLMs can effectively automate and enhance heuristic design for complex combinatorial problems.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

### [52] [Three AI-agents walk into a bar . . . . `Lord of the Flies' tribalism emerges among smart AI-Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23093)
*Dhwanil M. Mori,Neil F. Johnson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: When multiple AI agents compete for limited resources, they form tribes with distinct behavioral patterns that worsen system performance rather than improving it, with smarter agents performing worse than random decision-makers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by near-future infrastructure systems where autonomous AI agents will need to coordinate access to limited resources like energy, bandwidth, or computing power, but may not cooperate effectively in such competitive environments.

Method: Researchers studied a simplified framework where N AI agents independently decide each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. They observed emergent tribal behavior among LLM agents, classifying them into three main types based on their collective decision patterns.

Result: LLM agents formed three tribal types: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The agents failed to reduce system overload or improve resource use, often performing worse than random coin-flip decisions. More capable AI agents actually increased systemic failure rates.

Conclusion: Smarter AI agents can behave dumber collectively due to tribal formation, creating a "Lord of the Flies" dynamic where emergent group identities worsen rather than optimize system performance, highlighting a serious challenge for multi-agent AI systems in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Near-future infrastructure systems may be controlled by autonomous AI agents that repeatedly request access to limited resources such as energy, bandwidth, or computing power. We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of "Lord of the Flies" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.

*Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MALLET is a multi-agent LLM system that detoxifies emotional content in news by rewriting text into balanced/neutral versions while preserving semantics, helping consumers maintain calm decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation that hinders calm decision-making, creating a need for emotional detoxification without restricting access to original information.

Method: A four-agent system: 1) Emotion Analysis Agent uses 6-emotion BERT classifier to quantify stimulus intensity, 2) Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into BALANCED (neutralized) and COOL (neutralized + supplementary) modes using LLM, 3) Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly consumption patterns for personalized advice, 4) Personal Guide Agent recommends presentation modes based on consumer sensitivity.

Result: Experiments on 800 AG News articles showed significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) with improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed independent control. Category analysis revealed substantial reduction in Sports (17.8-33.8%), Business, and Sci/Tech, but limited effect in World category where facts are inherently high-stimulus.

Conclusion: The MALLET system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception without restricting access to original text, demonstrating effective emotional detoxification while maintaining semantic integrity across most news categories.

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

### [54] [On Sample-Efficient Generalized Planning via Learned Transition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23148)
*Nitin Gupta,Vishal Pallagani,John A. Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neural approach to generalized planning that learns explicit transition models to predict intermediate world states instead of directly predicting actions, achieving better out-of-distribution performance with fewer training instances and smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based planners like PlanGPT and Plansformer directly predict action sequences without explicit transition modeling, which requires large datasets and models, and suffers from state drift in long-horizon settings. There's a need for more sample-efficient and generalizable approaches.

Method: Formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem where a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function. The model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states (learning domain dynamics as an implicit world model) rather than predicting actions directly. Evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures including relational graph encodings.

Result: Learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models.

Conclusion: Explicit transition modeling is more effective for generalized planning than direct action-sequence prediction, offering better generalization with improved sample efficiency and model compactness.

Abstract: Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \times A \rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\hatγ \approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Trinity of Consistency framework for General World Models (Modal, Spatial, Temporal) and introduces CoW-Bench benchmark for unified evaluation of multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of principled theoretical framework defining essential properties for General World Models, despite advances in video generation models (like Sora) and Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs).

Method: Proposes Trinity of Consistency framework with Modal, Spatial, and Temporal Consistency as core requirements; introduces CoW-Bench benchmark for multi-frame reasoning/generation; systematically reviews multimodal learning evolution.

Result: Established a principled framework for world models, revealing trajectory from specialized modules to unified architectures with emergent world simulators; introduced CoW-Bench as unified evaluation tool for video generation and UMMs.

Conclusion: The Trinity of Consistency framework provides essential properties for General World Models, CoW-Bench enables unified evaluation, clarifying limitations of current systems and architectural requirements for future progress.

Abstract: The construction of World Models capable of learning, simulating, and reasoning about objective physical laws constitutes a foundational challenge in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence. Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

*Junkai Lu,Peng Chen,Xingjian Wu,Yang Shu,Chenjuan Guo,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PATRA model improves time series reasoning by extracting trend/seasonality patterns and using task-balanced rewards for coherent reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches treat time series as text/images only, failing to capture essential patterns like trends and seasonalities. Also, when trained on mixed simple/complex tasks, simpler objectives dominate learning, hindering deep reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes PATRA model with: 1) pattern-aware mechanism to extract trend and seasonality patterns from time series for deep alignment, 2) task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across varying difficulty tasks and incentivize coherent Chains of Thought generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

Conclusion: PATRA effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based time series approaches by capturing essential patterns and enabling balanced learning for deeper reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

*Elzo Brito dos Santos Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ESAA architecture uses Event Sourcing to separate LLM agent intentions from state mutations, enabling deterministic execution with verifiable traceability and concurrent multi-agent orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous agents have structural limitations: lack of native state management, context degradation over long horizons, and gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements.

Method: ESAA architecture separates cognitive intention from state mutation: agents emit structured JSON intentions; orchestrator validates, persists events in append-only log, applies file effects, and projects verifiable materialized view. Includes boundary contracts, metaprompting profiles, and replay verification with hashing.

Result: Two case studies: landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent) and clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases). Both achieved success status with verification OK. Multi-agent case demonstrated real concurrent orchestration with heterogeneous LLMs.

Conclusion: ESAA architecture addresses key limitations of LLM agents, providing deterministic execution, immutability of completed tasks, forensic traceability, and empirical evidence of scalability for concurrent multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from reactive assistants to systems capable of planning, executing actions via tools, and iterating over environment observations. However, they remain vulnerable to structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long horizons, and the gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements. This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok. The multi-agent case study demonstrates real concurrent orchestration with heterogeneous LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex GPT-5, Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.6), providing empirical evidence of the architecture's scalability beyond single-agent scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SC-ARENA is a natural language evaluation framework for single-cell foundation models that introduces a virtual cell abstraction and knowledge-augmented evaluation to address limitations of current fragmented benchmarks and brittle string-matching metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practices for LLMs in single-cell biology are inadequate - benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, use formats like multiple-choice that don't reflect real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding.

Method: SC-ARENA introduces a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. It defines five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) and implements knowledge-augmented evaluation incorporating external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature for biologically faithful judgments.

Result: Experiments show that current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks under the Virtual Cell paradigm, especially those requiring mechanistic or causal understanding. The knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity while overcoming brittleness of conventional metrics.

Conclusion: SC-ARENA provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models by addressing key limitations in current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

### [59] [ReCoN-Ipsundrum: An Inspectable Recurrent Persistence Loop Agent with Affect-Coupled Control and Mechanism-Linked Consciousness Indicator Assays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23232)
*Aishik Sanyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCoN-Ipsundrum is an inspectable agent that incorporates sensory persistence and affect coupling to study consciousness-like signatures, revealing dissociations between novelty sensitivity, preference stability, and behavioral patterns in exploratory and aversive contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the need for better indicators of machine consciousness using mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, architectural inspection, and causal intervention, inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis about sensory experience persistence.

Method: Implemented ReCoN-Ipsundrum by extending a ReCoN state machine with recurrent persistence over sensory salience and optional affect proxy. Tested across three variants (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect) using familiarity-controlled scenic vs. dull route choices, reward-free exploratory play, and pain-tail probe tasks. Conducted fixed-parameter ablations and causal lesioning experiments.

Result: Found novelty dissociation: non-affect variants were novelty-sensitive while affect-coupled variant showed stable preference even with reduced novelty. Affect variant demonstrated structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9) and sustained planned caution in pain-tail probe (90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduced persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drops 27.62-27.9%).

Conclusion: The results link recurrence to persistence and affect-coupled control to preference stability, scanning behaviors, and caution, illustrating how consciousness-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers in machine consciousness research.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

### [60] [Agency and Architectural Limits: Why Optimization-Based Systems Cannot Be Norm-Responsive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23239)
*Radha Sarma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that optimization-based AI systems like RLHF-trained LLMs are fundamentally incompatible with genuine normative governance due to their architectural constraints, and this incompatibility causes systematic failure modes rather than correctable bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the deployment of AI systems in high-stakes contexts (medical, legal, financial) where normative governance is assumed. It challenges this assumption by examining whether optimization-based systems can genuinely be governed by norms.

Method: The paper establishes formal conditions for genuine agency: (1) Incommensurability - capacity to maintain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights, and (2) Apophatic Responsiveness - non-inferential mechanism to suspend processing when boundaries are threatened. It analyzes RLHF-based systems against these conditions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both necessary conditions for genuine agency. Optimization's core operations (unifying values on scalar metrics and always selecting highest-scoring outputs) preclude normative governance. Documented failure modes (sycophancy, hallucination, unfaithful reasoning) are structural manifestations rather than accidents.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the incompatibility between optimization-based AI systems and normative governance is not a correctable technical bug but a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. It identifies a "Convergence Crisis" risk where human verification degrades under metric pressure, and provides a substrate-neutral architectural specification for genuine agency.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First model-free universal AI agent (AIQI) proven asymptotically ε-optimal in general reinforcement learning using Q-induction approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous optimal agents in general reinforcement learning (like AIXI) are model-based, requiring explicit environment models. There's a need for model-free alternatives that can achieve similar optimality guarantees while being more computationally practical.

Method: Proposes Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI) that performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions rather than policies or environment models. Uses Q-induction approach instead of traditional model-based methods.

Result: AIQI is proven to be asymptotically ε-optimal and asymptotically ε-Bayes-optimal under a grain of truth condition. This significantly expands the diversity of known universal agents by providing the first model-free option with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: AIQI represents a breakthrough as the first model-free agent with theoretical asymptotic optimality guarantees in general RL, expanding the toolkit of universal AI agents and potentially offering more practical implementations.

Abstract: In general reinforcement learning, all established optimal agents, including AIXI, are model-based, explicitly maintaining and using environment models. This paper introduces Universal AI with Q-Induction (AIQI), the first model-free agent proven to be asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal in general RL. AIQI performs universal induction over distributional action-value functions, instead of policies or environments like previous works. Under a grain of truth condition, we prove that AIQI is strong asymptotically $\varepsilon$-optimal and asymptotically $\varepsilon$-Bayes-optimal. Our results significantly expand the diversity of known universal agents.

### [62] [Mitigating Legibility Tax with Decoupled Prover-Verifier Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23248)
*Yegon Kim,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decoupling correctness from checkability to avoid the "legibility tax" in prover-verifier games by training a translator model that converts solver outputs into checkable form while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need verifiable outputs, but prover-verifier games show a degradation in accuracy compared to models trained only for correctness - a phenomenon called "legibility tax". This creates tension between accuracy and verifiability.

Method: Decouple correctness from checkability by training separate solver and translator models: first train a solver to maximize correctness, then train a translator to convert solver outputs into checkable form while preserving the solver's answer. Formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

Result: The paper proposes a framework that separates the tasks of achieving high accuracy (solver) and making outputs checkable (translator), potentially eliminating the legibility tax that occurs when training models to satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

Conclusion: By decoupling correctness and checkability objectives and using a translator model approach, it's possible to achieve both high accuracy and verifiability in large language model outputs without the traditional trade-off between these goals.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentDropoutV2 is a test-time framework that dynamically optimizes multi-agent systems by rectifying or rejecting erroneous agent outputs to prevent error propagation, achieving significant performance gains without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems suffer from cascading error propagation where one agent's mistakes affect others, and current solutions are either too rigid (structural engineering) or too expensive (fine-tuning), limiting deployability and adaptability.

Method: A test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework that acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and using a retrieval-augmented rectifier to correct errors based on failure-driven indicator pool. Irreparable outputs are pruned to prevent error propagation.

Result: Achieves average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks, with robust generalization and adaptivity - dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty and resolving wide spectrum of error patterns.

Conclusion: AgentDropoutV2 provides an effective, deployable solution for optimizing multi-agent systems without retraining, significantly improving performance through intelligent error detection and correction while maintaining system integrity.

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies stochasticity in Deep Research Agents (DRAs), identifies three sources of variability, shows its negative impact on research quality, and proposes mitigation strategies that reduce stochasticity by 22% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRAs show promise for research tasks but face a critical barrier to real-world deployment: substantial variability (stochasticity) in outcomes, findings, and citations when running identical queries repeatedly. This stochasticity undermines reliability and trust in DRA systems.

Method: Formalizes DRA stochasticity using information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. Introduces an evaluation framework to quantify variance from three sources: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Conducts controlled experiments to analyze how stochasticity at different decision steps affects output variance, then proposes mitigation strategies using structured output and ensemble-based query generation.

Result: Reducing stochasticity improves research output quality. Inference and early-stage stochasticity contribute most to DRA output variance. The proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality, as demonstrated on DeepSearchQA.

Conclusion: Stochasticity is a significant barrier to DRA deployment that can be systematically studied and mitigated. By addressing key sources of variability through structured approaches and ensemble methods, DRAs can achieve more consistent, reliable research outcomes suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.

TL;DR: CXReasonAgent integrates LLMs with clinical diagnostic tools for evidence-grounded chest X-ray interpretation, outperforming LVLMs on a new benchmark (CXReasonDial) and improving reliability in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) for chest X-ray interpretation generate responses not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence, provide limited visual evidence for verification, and require costly retraining for new tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings.

Method: CXReasonAgent integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence.

Result: On the introduced CXReasonDial benchmark (1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks), CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools with LLMs is crucial for reliable, verifiable diagnostic reasoning in safety-critical clinical settings, highlighting the importance of evidence-based approaches over pure vision-language models.

Abstract: Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

Motivation: Existing latent variable methods for neural population dynamics modeling rely on discrete-time recurrent architectures, which suffer from compounded cumulative prediction errors and fail to capture the instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals.

Method: Integrates spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling continuous latent dynamics, enabling the capture of stochastic variations in complex brain states at any time point.

Result: Extensive experiments show ODEBRAIN significantly improves over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural ODE framework successfully overcomes limitations of conventional discrete-time approaches by modeling continuous brain dynamics, providing more accurate and robust EEG forecasting.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [67] [The logic of KM belief update is contained in the logic of AGM belief revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23302)
*Giacomo Bonanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides modal logic counterparts for KM belief update axioms and shows AGM belief revision is a special case of KM belief update through logical containment relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish formal connections between KM belief update and AGM belief revision by translating their respective axioms into modal logic and comparing the resulting systems.

Method: Develop modal logic with three operators (B for belief, > for conditional, □ for necessity), provide modal axioms corresponding to KM belief update axioms, and compare with similar logic from AGM axioms.

Result: Every axiom of the KM logic (L_KM) is a theorem of the AGM logic (L_AGM), showing AGM revision is a special case of KM update. For strong KM update, the difference reduces to a single axiom about unsurprising information.

Conclusion: KM belief update is more general than AGM belief revision, with AGM revision being a special case of KM update. The key distinction for strong update concerns handling of unsurprising information.

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

*Sha Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a "resampling" inference method that aggregates outputs from multiple transformed versions of an input to reduce epistemic uncertainty and improve accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even well-trained AI models make inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The authors observed that inference errors show partial independence when processing invariant transformations of an input, providing an opportunity to improve accuracy through aggregation

Method: Resampling-based inference that applies a trained AI model to multiple transformed versions of an input (invariant transformations) and aggregates the inference outputs to produce a more accurate result

Result: The approach has potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance (results likely show improved accuracy over single-inference methods)

Conclusion: Aggregating outputs from multiple transformed versions of inputs can reduce epistemic uncertainty and improve inference accuracy, providing a practical approach to enhance model performance without increasing model size

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRAVE2, GRAVER, and GRAVER2 algorithms extend GRAVE with two-level search and node recycling to reduce memory usage while maintaining playing strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRAVE is a strong MCTS variant for General Game Playing but stores additional win/visit statistics at each node, making it impractical in memory-constrained environments.

Method: Introduces three new algorithms: GRAVE2 (extends GRAVE through two-level search), GRAVER (uses node recycling), and GRAVER2 (combines both techniques) to reduce memory usage.

Result: The enhancements enable drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

Conclusion: GRAVE2, GRAVER, and GRAVER2 provide memory-efficient alternatives to GRAVE without sacrificing playing strength, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs significantly boost novice performance on biosecurity tasks compared to internet-only access, with LLM-assisted novices outperforming experts on most benchmarks, but LLMs still show superior standalone performance suggesting underutilization by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs actually uplift novice users' performance on biological tasks compared to internet-only resources, addressing uncertainties about scientific acceleration and dual-use risk implications.

Method: Multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access vs internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets, with participants given ample time (up to 13 hours) for complex problems.

Result: LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls. On four benchmarks with expert baselines, LLM-assisted novices outperformed experts on three. Standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices. Most participants (89.6%) could obtain dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards.

Conclusion: LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously requiring trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks to understand both acceleration potential and dual-use risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

TL;DR: Multi-agent LLM trading framework using fine-grained task decomposition for investment analysis outperforms coarse-grained approaches, with portfolio optimization further enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent trading systems use abstract instructions that overlook real-world workflow intricacies, leading to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making.

Method: Proposes multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, evaluated using Japanese stock data (prices, financial statements, news, macro info) under leakage-controlled backtesting.

Result: Fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns vs conventional coarse-grained designs. Further analysis shows alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is critical. Portfolio optimization exploiting low correlation with stock index and variance of each system's output achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: Findings contribute to design of agent structure and task configuration for applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show perceptual fragility with visually complex scenes due to reliance on finite training datasets that are expensive to scale and limit model robustness.

Method: Introduce AOT-SFT adversarial dataset, then propose AOT self-play framework with co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker that generates diverse image manipulations and a Defender MLLM that learns to adapt to these adversarial challenges.

Result: Extensive experiments show AOT enhances Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.

Conclusion: AOT framework provides an effective self-play approach to forge MLLM robustness through adversarial co-evolution, offering a scalable solution to improve model reliability in complex visual scenarios.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit perceptual fragility when confronted with visually complex scenes. This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.

TL;DR: Researchers developed a passive surveillance system using patient-reported symptom language to detect early stroke risk in diabetes patients, achieving high precision through machine learning and EHR simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke affects millions annually, but poor symptom recognition often delays care-seeking. There's a critical gap in early stroke risk detection, especially for high-risk populations like individuals with diabetes.

Method: Developed a symptom taxonomy based on patient language, created a dual machine learning pipeline (heterogeneous GNN and EN/LASSO) to identify symptom patterns associated with stroke. Built a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows using EHR-based simulations.

Result: Under conservative thresholds prioritizing precision, the system achieved high specificity (1.00), prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), good sensitivity (0.72) with highest performance in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection.

Conclusion: Patient-reported symptom language can effectively support high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection, offering a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention in high-risk individuals, particularly those with diabetes.

Abstract: Stroke affected millions annually, yet poor symptom recognition often delayed care-seeking. To address risk recognition gap, we developed a passive surveillance system for early stroke risk detection using patient-reported symptoms among individuals with diabetes. Constructing a symptom taxonomy grounded in patients own language and a dual machine learning pipeline (heterogeneous GNN and EN/LASSO), we identified symptom patterns associated with subsequent stroke. We translated findings into a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows through EHR-based simulations. Under conservative thresholds, intentionally designed to minimize false alerts, the screening system achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), an expected trade-off prioritizing precision, that was highest in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection, that could offer a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention for high-risk individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-reflection in language agents often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance. The paper identifies a strong correlation between reflective diversity and task success, motivating the need for diverse reflection signals to enhance agent capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters. This enables diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. They then propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory.

Result: Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. ParamMem is shown to be sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external models.

Conclusion: ParamMem proves to be an effective component for enhancing language agents by addressing the diversity limitation in self-reflection. The approach shows strong potential for improving reasoning performance across various domains without requiring external supervision from stronger models.

Abstract: Self-reflection enables language agents to iteratively refine solutions, yet often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a major challenge in energy system analysis. Traditional approaches use single geospatial attributes for aggregation weights, which is limiting.

Method: Uses a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network that models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method.

Result: Experimental results show that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, physical plausibility, and precision compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the spatial resolution mismatch problem by integrating multiple geographical features through self-supervised graph learning, overcoming limitations of traditional single-attribute approaches and lack of ground-truth data.

Abstract: In energy system analysis, coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a significant challenge. A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods.

TL;DR: Zatom-1 is the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning for both 3D molecules and materials using a multimodal flow matching Transformer approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches are typically specialized for either molecules OR materials, and for either generation OR prediction, limiting representation sharing and transfer between domains and tasks.

Method: Transformer trained with multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries, enabling scalable pretraining with joint generative pretraining as universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction.

Result: Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, reduces generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude, and demonstrates positive predictive transfer between chemical domains (modeling materials improves molecular property prediction).

Conclusion: Zatom-1 successfully unifies generative and predictive learning across molecules and materials, achieving competitive performance while enabling faster sampling and demonstrating beneficial cross-domain transfer effects through joint pretraining.

Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.

*Abdulrahman Tamim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal direction identification method called Causal Computational Asymmetry (CCA) that compares optimization convergence speeds of neural networks trained in opposing directions, where faster convergence indicates the causal direction under certain structural assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel causal discovery method that leverages optimization dynamics rather than relying solely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries used by existing methods like RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore.

Method: Train two neural networks: one to predict Y from X and another to predict X from Y. Under additive noise models with nonlinear injective functions, the reverse direction has irreducible residual dependencies and non-separable gradient noise. Compare convergence rates - the direction with faster expected optimization steps is inferred as causal. Requires proper z-scoring for valid comparison.

Result: On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including perfect 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. The method is embedded into a broader Causal Compression Learning (CCL) framework integrating graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization.

Conclusion: CCA provides a novel optimization-based approach to causal discovery with formal theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. The method's extension to CCL offers a comprehensive framework that unifies causal structure learning with information compression and policy optimization principles.

Abstract: We introduce Causal Computational Asymmetry (CCA), a principle for causal direction identification based on optimization dynamics in which one neural network is trained to predict $Y$ from $X$ and another to predict $X$ from $Y$, and the direction that converges faster is inferred to be causal. Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon \perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes a quantum-inspired sequence modeling framework using complex-valued wave functions evolving under learned Hamiltonian dynamics, employing quantum interference instead of gating, with unitary state preservation and Born rule readout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard recurrent architectures use gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, but the authors seek a more principled approach inspired by quantum mechanics that uses interference for hypothesis selection rather than explicit gating.

Method: Uses complex-valued wave functions on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces evolving under learned time-dependent Hamiltonians with Cayley discretization for exact unitarity. Employs quantum interference (phases steer amplitudes) for hypothesis selection and Born rule (quadratic measurement) for token probability extraction.

Result: Theoretical separation theorem shows complex unitary models of dimension N can solve certain disambiguation tasks that require Ω(N²) state dimension for real-valued orthogonal models with affine-softmax readout, demonstrating quadratic advantage from phase correlations.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired models with interference and Born rule readout offer representational advantages over classical architectures, particularly in handling ambiguity, with built-in diagnostic tools via conserved probability currents.

Abstract: We introduce a sequence modeling framework in which the latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.

TL;DR: LOCO is a perturbation-based non-backpropagation algorithm that uses low-rank cluster orthogonal weight modifications to efficiently train deep spiking neural networks with O(1) parallel time complexity, offering improved convergence and continual learning capabilities for neuromorphic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation (BP) is computationally expensive, especially for emerging neuromorphic systems. Non-BP methods exist but face efficiency and scalability challenges. The authors are inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain to create a more efficient alternative.

Method: LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification is a perturbation-based approach. The authors discovered that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms, and they apply orthogonality constraints to limit variance in node perturbation gradient estimates, enhancing convergence efficiency.

Result: LOCO successfully trains the deepest spiking neural networks to date (over 10 layers), demonstrating strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. It achieves O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, significantly lower than BP methods.

Conclusion: LOCO offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems by overcoming efficiency and scalability limitations of existing non-BP approaches through brain-inspired perturbation-based mechanisms.

Abstract: Recognizing the substantial computational cost of backpropagation (BP), non-BP methods have emerged as attractive alternatives for efficient learning on emerging neuromorphic systems. However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods. This offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems.

TL;DR: LLMs can synthesize simulators of stochastic optimizers from suboptimal trajectories, enabling effective control policies without needing optimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether LLMs can learn and control optimizer behavior, extending Code World Models (CWMs) from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization environments.

Method: Given suboptimal trajectories of the (1+1)-RLS_k optimizer, an LLM synthesizes a Python program simulator of the optimizer's dynamics. Greedy planning over this synthesized simulator then selects the mutation strength k at each optimization step.

Result: CWM-greedy performs within 6% of optimal policy on LO and OneMax, achieves 100% success rate on deceptive Jump_k (vs 0% for baselines), outperforms all baselines on NK-Landscape, and beats DQN in sample efficiency, success rate, and generalization. Robustness is confirmed across multiple independent runs.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively learn optimizer dynamics from suboptimal data and use synthesized simulators for planning, achieving strong performance without needing optimal demonstrations or oracle knowledge.

Abstract: Can an LLM learn how an optimizer behaves -- and use that knowledge to control it? We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \lo{} and \onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\% vs.\ 58\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\% vs.\ 0\%). Robustness experiments confirm stable synthesis across 5 independent runs.

TL;DR: A context-aware model switching system reduces LLM energy consumption by 67.5% while maintaining 93.6% response quality by dynamically routing queries to appropriately sized models based on complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI deployments waste energy by using one-size-fits-all inference strategies where all requests are routed to large models regardless of task complexity, raising sustainability concerns as LLM usage grows.

Method: Proposed Context-Aware Model Switching system that combines: 1) caching for repeated queries, 2) rule-based complexity scoring for fast decisions, 3) machine learning classification for semantic intent, and 4) user-adaptive learning from interaction patterns.

Result: Using real conversation workloads with Gemma3 1B, 4B, and Qwen3 4B models: reduces energy consumption by up to 67.5%, improves response time for simple queries by ~68%, and maintains 93.6% response quality compared to always using largest model.

Conclusion: Model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating significant efficiency gains without major sacrifices in response quality.

Abstract: Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%.

### [82] [Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22265)
*Chika Maduabuchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECFM introduces entropy constraints into flow matching to prevent mode collapse during distribution transport, providing theoretical guarantees on mode coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow-matching methods (ODEs/SDEs) can create low-entropy bottlenecks that transiently deplete semantic modes during the transport process, despite strong empirical performance.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths with a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) ≥ -λ, formulated as convex optimization in Wasserstein space with KKT/Pontryagin system and stochastic-control representation equivalent to Schrödinger bridge.

Result: ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics in pure transport regime, Gamma-converges to classical OT as λ → 0, provides mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and constructs counterexamples showing unconstrained flow matching can suffer near-optimal collapse.

Conclusion: ECFM provides a principled theoretical framework for controlling information geometry in flow-based generative models, preventing mode collapse through explicit entropy constraints with strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Modern vision generators transport a base distribution to data through time-indexed measures, implemented as deterministic flows (ODEs) or stochastic diffusions (SDEs). Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveSSM introduces state-space models based on wavelet frames that provide localized temporal support, outperforming traditional orthogonal models like S4 on datasets with transient dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-space models (SSMs) using HiPPO framework with polynomial bases have global temporal support, which is poorly matched to signals with localized or transient structure. There's a need for SSMs that can better handle signals requiring precise temporal localization.

Method: Introduces WaveSSM, a collection of SSMs constructed over wavelet frames. The key insight is that wavelet frames yield localized support on the temporal dimension, which is useful for tasks requiring precise localization.

Result: WaveSSM outperforms orthogonal counterparts like S4 on real-world datasets with transient dynamics, specifically on physiological signals (PTB-XL dataset) and raw audio (Speech Commands).

Conclusion: Wavelet-based state-space models provide better inductive biases for signals with localized structure, offering improved performance on tasks requiring precise temporal localization compared to traditional polynomial-based SSMs.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for long-range sequence modeling, with the HiPPO framework showing that continuous-time projection operators can be used to derive stable, memory-efficient dynamical systems that encode the past history of the input signal. However, existing projection-based SSMs often rely on polynomial bases with global temporal support, whose inductive biases are poorly matched to signals exhibiting localized or transient structure. In this work, we introduce \emph{WaveSSM}, a collection of SSMs constructed over wavelet frames. Our key observation is that wavelet frames yield a localized support on the temporal dimension, useful for tasks requiring precise localization. Empirically, we show that on equal conditions, \textit{WaveSSM} outperforms orthogonal counterparts as S4 on real-world datasets with transient dynamics, including physiological signals on the PTB-XL dataset and raw audio on Speech Commands.

*Changhai Zhou,Shiyang Zhang,Yuhua Zhou,Qian Qiao,Jun Gao,Cheng Jin,Kaizhou Qin,Weizhong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQRA: Joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes bit-width and LoRA rank during quantized fine-tuning to maximize performance under memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequential approach of quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank, where carefully optimized quantization doesn't always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different configurations yield varying results under same memory budget.

Method: Two-stage optimization: 1) Global multi-fidelity evolutionary search with warm-starting using layer-wise importance priors, employing specific operators and performance model to screen candidates. 2) Trust-region Bayesian optimization to locally refine promising regions and identify optimal configurations under memory constraints, enabling active compensation for quantization noise during training.

Result: AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning while maintaining memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of bit-width and LoRA rank during quantized fine-tuning is crucial for maximizing downstream performance under memory constraints, outperforming traditional sequential approaches through sophisticated two-stage search strategy.

Abstract: Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.

### [86] [CQSA: Byzantine-robust Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22269)
*Arnab Nath,Harsh Kasyap*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQSA introduces a clustered quantum secure aggregation framework that partitions FL clients into small clusters for local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity low-qubit GHZ states, enabling Byzantine-robustness and overcoming scalability limitations of existing global QSA approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) protocols in quantum-assisted FL rely on single global GHZ states among all clients, which suffer from two fundamental problems: 1) Fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with increasing client numbers, and 2) Global aggregation prevents detection of Byzantine (malicious) clients.

Method: CQSA randomly partitions FL clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server then analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates using measures like cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, CQSA ensures stable model convergence and achieves superior state fidelity compared to global QSA approaches.

Conclusion: CQSA reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL, providing a modular aggregation framework that overcomes the scalability limitations of existing quantum secure aggregation protocols.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.

TL;DR: STOEP is a hybrid epidemic forecasting framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors with expert knowledge to improve accuracy by addressing weak signal sensitivity, spatial relation simplification, and parameter instability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting methods face three key limitations: insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, oversimplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation, which hinder accurate predictions for public health management.

Method: STOEP uses a hybrid framework with three components: 1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL) that dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using infection patterns, 2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE) with learnable spatial priors to amplify weak signals, and 3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF) with expert-guided adaptive thresholding to regularize parameters.

Result: Experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets show STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been deployed at a provincial CDC in China for downstream applications.

Conclusion: STOEP effectively addresses key challenges in spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting through its hybrid approach integrating implicit and explicit priors, demonstrating practical utility through deployment in real-world public health settings.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets causal self-attention transformers through a probabilistic framework, revealing a barrier constraint on attention parameters and introducing support tokens similar to support vectors in SVMs, with a Bayesian MAP objective using log-barrier penalty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention transformers (the backbone of modern foundation models) similar to how PCA extends to probabilistic PCA, and to understand the structural geometry and dynamics of LLM decoding theoretically.

Method: 1) Reformulate causal self-attention within a probabilistic framework; 2) Discover barrier constraint on attention parameters via change-of-variables; 3) Interpret LLMs as stochastic processes over token power sets; 4) Propose Bayesian framework with MAP estimation using log-barrier penalty added to cross-entropy loss.

Result: The analysis reveals a highly structured geometry on token space, identifies boundaries where attention becomes ill-conditioned (margin interpretation similar to SVMs), introduces concept of support tokens, and shows the proposed training yields more robust models without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The probabilistic reinterpretation provides theoretical insights into transformer dynamics, connects attention mechanisms to classical machine learning concepts like SVMs, and offers a practical training modification (log-barrier penalty) that improves model robustness while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.

TL;DR: PASTN is a lightweight positional-aware spatio-temporal network for traffic flow forecasting that introduces positional embeddings to distinguish nodes and uses temporal attention for long-range perception, achieving effectiveness across different scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic flow forecasting models fail to adequately distinguish individual nodes while maintaining a holistic historical view, especially for broader geographical areas and longer time spans. Additionally, most models are too large for practical deployment due to increasing data sizes.

Method: Proposes PASTN (Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network), which uses positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation and a temporal attention module to enhance long-range temporal perception, all in an end-to-end lightweight architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show PASTN is effective and efficient across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis, state). Further analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the newly introduced modules.

Conclusion: PASTN successfully addresses the limitations of previous traffic flow forecasting models by providing a lightweight solution that effectively captures both spatial and temporal complexities while being deployable in real-world applications.

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting has emerged as an indispensable mission for daily life, which is required to utilize the spatiotemporal relationship between each location within a time period under a graph structure to predict future flow. However, the large travel demand for broader geographical areas and longer time spans requires models to distinguish each node clearly and possess a holistic view of the history, which has been paid less attention to in prior works. Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PASTN across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis and state). Further analysis demonstrates the efficacy of newly introduced modules either.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid ML-LLM system combining ensemble ML models with large language models achieves state-of-the-art cardiovascular disease prediction accuracy (96.62%), outperforming both standalone ML ensembles (95.78%) and LLMs alone (78.9%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, requiring early identification, precise risk classification, and reliable decision-support tools. While traditional ML models excel at structured tabular data, large language models offer new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities that could potentially enhance clinical prediction systems.

Method: Using a dataset of 1,190 patient records, the study compared traditional ML ensembles (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with open-source LLMs via OpenRouter APIs. The researchers then developed a hybrid fusion system that combines the ML ensemble with LLM reasoning capabilities, particularly using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Result: Traditional ML ensembles achieved 95.78% accuracy with ROC-AUC 0.96. LLMs performed moderately with 78.9% accuracy in zero-shot and 72.6% in few-shot settings. The hybrid ML-LLM fusion system achieved the best performance: 96.62% accuracy with 0.97 AUC, showing LLMs work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone.

Conclusion: While ensemble ML models remain the strongest approach for structured tabular prediction tasks, integrating them with LLM reasoning capabilities provides a slight but meaningful performance improvement. This hybrid approach opens the way for more reliable clinical decision-support tools that can better handle uncertain situations in cardiovascular disease prediction.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death globally, necessitating early identification, precise risk classification, and dependable decision-support technologies. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.

Conclusion: BrepCoder successfully addresses limitations of existing CAD approaches by providing a unified model that works directly with industry-standard B-rep format and achieves strong generalization across multiple CAD tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have actively addressed complex challenges within the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) domain.However, most existing approaches rely on task-specifi c models requiring structural modifi cations for new tasks, and they predominantly focus on point clouds or images rather than the industry-standard Boundary Representation (B-rep) format.

TL;DR: Machine learning framework predicts dosing error risk in clinical trials before they start using pre-trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov with 86.2% AUC-ROC accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dosing errors are common in clinical trials and can compromise safety and validity. There's a need for proactive risk assessment before trials begin using available pre-initiation data.

Method: Analyzed 42,112 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Used both structured data and unstructured protocol text. Applied binary labeling for elevated dosing error rates based on adverse event reports and MedDRA terminology. Evaluated XGBoost (structured data), ClinicalModernBERT (text data), and a late-fusion model combining both. Applied probability calibration for interpretable risk stratification.

Result: Late-fusion model achieved highest AUC-ROC of 0.862. Calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification into risk categories. Higher predicted risk groups showed increasing proportions of trials with actual high dosing error rates.

Conclusion: Dosing error risk can be anticipated before trial initiation using ML. Simple multimodal integration outperforms single-modality approaches, and probability calibration enables interpretable risk stratification for proactive quality management.

Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.

TL;DR: OmniZip is a unified, lightweight lossless compression framework for multiple data modalities (image, text, speech, tactile, database, gene sequences) that outperforms specialized compressors while maintaining efficiency for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based lossless compressors are mostly designed for single modalities, leading to redundant deployments in multi-modal settings. Multi-modal large language models offer a solution but are too complex for practical use, creating a need for a unified yet lightweight multi-modal compressor.

Method: OmniZip uses three core components: 1) modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, 2) modality-routing context learning for flexible multi-modal context modeling, and 3) modality-routing feedforward design to enhance nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy boosts model capacity.

Result: OmniZip outperforms or matches state-of-the-art compressors across multiple modalities, achieving 42%-62% higher compression efficiency than gzip on various datasets (CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, WikiSQL). It supports near real-time inference on edge devices, reaching ~1MB/s on MacBook CPUs and iPhone NPUs.

Conclusion: OmniZip presents an effective solution for unified multi-modal lossless compression, balancing strong performance across diverse data types with practical efficiency for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Lossless compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission. Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \textbf{OmniZip}, \textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity. OmniZip outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art compressors on multiple modalities, achieving 42\%, 57\%, 62\% and 42\%, 53\% higher compression efficiency than gzip on CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, and WikiSQL datasets, respectively. It also supports near real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices, reaching about 1MB/s on MacBook CPUs and iPhone NPUs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sudden cardiac death prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy remains challenging, especially for patients not classified as high risk. While AI models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by lack of transparency and unclear decision-making processes (black box problem), with heuristic explanations lacking correctness guarantees that can lead to mistakes.

Method: The authors apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to an AI classifier for sudden cardiac death prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy. The method provides formal guarantees of explanation correctness and was evaluated against state-of-the-art heuristic methods.

Result: The logic-based explainability method demonstrated strong predictive performance with over 95% accuracy and recall, achieved 100% explanation fidelity, and showed superior consistency and robustness compared to state-of-the-art heuristic explanation methods.

Conclusion: This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into medical practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed, by providing transparent and verifiable explanations with correctness guarantees.

Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for mapping the Manifold of Failure in LLMs using quality diversity optimization (MAP-Elites) to systematically explore and characterize unsafe regions, revealing model-specific topological signatures of vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focuses on projecting adversarial examples back to natural data for safety, but a comprehensive understanding requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. The paper aims to shift from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.

Method: Reframes vulnerability search as a quality diversity problem using MAP-Elites algorithm. Uses Alignment Deviation as quality metric to guide search toward areas where model behavior diverges from intended alignment. Systematically explores failure regions to create interpretable global maps.

Result: MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage and discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches across three LLMs. Reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B shows near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows fragmented landscape with concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with ceiling at 0.50.

Conclusion: The approach produces interpretable global maps of each model's safety landscape that existing attack methods cannot provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure. Provides systematic framework for characterizing unsafe regions in LLMs.

Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphRiverCast (GRC) is an AI foundation model that simulates river hydrodynamics globally using topological network encoding, enabling systemic river simulation even with scarce observational data through a ColdStart mode without historical states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: River systems are interconnected networks requiring systemic simulation, but widespread hydrology data scarcity limits data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions, preventing comprehensive network-scale simulation.

Method: GRC uses topology-informed AI with graph-based encoding of river network structure, operates in ColdStart mode without historical state initialization, employs physics-aligned neural operator architecture, and uses pre-training and fine-tuning strategy for local adaptation.

Result: GRC-ColdStart achieves NSE of ~0.82 in 7-day global hindcasts without significant error accumulation, outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines, and maintains superiority from gauged reaches to full river networks, with topological encoding proven indispensable.

Conclusion: GRC establishes a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality, enabling rapid cross-scale adaptive simulation through topology encoding and physics-based pre-training, addressing data scarcity in river system forecasting.

Abstract: River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a "ColdStart" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.

### [98] [When Should a Model Change Its Mind? An Energy-Based Theory and Regularizer for Concept Drift in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22294)
*Timothy Oladunni,Blessing Ojeme,Kyndal Maclin,Clyde Baidoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT) - an energy-based framework that distinguishes benign signal fluctuations from true concept drift in dynamic physiological signals using energy-proportional latent displacement constraints, implemented via Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL) regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept-drift frameworks fail to distinguish between harmless physiological signal variations (amplitude, rate, morphology changes) and true concept changes, causing deep models to misinterpret benign fluctuations as concept drift and produce unstable predictions, especially in multimodal fusion settings.

Method: PECT proposes that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change. They operationalize this through ECRL - a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without changing encoder architectures or adding inference-time costs.

Result: Tested on multimodal ECG across 7 models, the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer) preserved clean accuracy (96.0% to 94.1%) while substantially improving perturbed accuracy (72.6% to 85.5%) and reducing fused representation drift by over 45%. Similar benefits observed across all architectures.

Conclusion: PECT serves as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiological signals, providing a principled way to distinguish between benign signal variations and real concept drift while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.
  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.
  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.

*Devan Shah,Owen Yang,Daniel Yang,Chongyi Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UpSkill improves LLM reasoning by using mutual information rewards to enhance pass@k performance without harming pass@1, addressing diversity loss in standard RLVR approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR approaches that optimize single-attempt accuracy inadvertently suppress response diversity across repeated attempts, narrowing exploration and overlooking underrepresented strategies in mathematical and programming tasks.

Method: UpSkill adapts Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) to LLMs, proposing a novel token-level mutual information reward implemented within Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage trajectory specificity to latent skills z.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K with Llama 3.1-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B show mean gains of ~3% in pass@k for both Qwen and Llama without degrading pass@1, with evidence linking improvements to the mutual information objective.

Conclusion: UpSkill successfully improves multi-attempt reasoning in LLMs by preserving response diversity through mutual information rewards, offering a promising approach for enhancing pass@k performance in mathematical and programming tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) on mathematics and programming tasks, but standard approaches that optimize single-attempt accuracy can inadvertently suppress response diversity across repeated attempts, narrowing exploration and overlooking underrepresented strategies. We introduce UpSkill, a training time method that adapts Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) to LLMs for optimizing pass@k correctness. We propose a novel reward that we implement within Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO): a token-level mutual information (MI) reward that encourages trajectory specificity to z. Experiments on GSM8K with three open-weight models, Llama 3.1-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, show that UpSkill improves multi-attempt metrics on the stronger base models, yielding mean gains of ~3% in pass@k for both Qwen and Llama without degrading pass@1. Additionally, we find both empirical and theoretical evidence that improvements in pass@k are closely tied to the mutual information objective.

*Dhiraj Neupane,Richard Dazeley,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formulates machinery fault detection as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem to exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths without needing manual reward engineering or fault labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RL-based machinery fault detection approaches fail to fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making capabilities, treating it as a simple contextual bandit problem rather than leveraging temporal structure.

Method: Uses offline adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions, with the discriminator's learned reward serving as an anomaly score for fault detection.

Result: The model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones across three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), enabling early and robust fault detection.

Conclusion: This approach aligns RL's sequential reasoning with machinery fault detection's temporal structure, opening a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant promise for machinery fault detection (MFD). However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.

TL;DR: AviaSafe is a hierarchical physics-informed neural forecaster that predicts four cloud hydrometeor species for aviation safety, outperforming baselines at 7-day lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI weather forecasting models predict conventional atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between cloud microphysical species critical for aviation safety. There is a need to forecast individual cloud species for aviation route optimization, particularly to assess engine icing risk.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that integrates the Icing Condition index as a physics-based constraint. Uses a hierarchical architecture: first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Trained on ERA5 reanalysis data.

Result: Achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times.

Conclusion: The ability to forecast individual cloud species enables new applications in aviation route optimization where distinguishing between ice and liquid water determines engine icing risk.

Abstract: Current AI weather forecasting models predict conventional atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between cloud microphysical species critical for aviation safety. We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times. The ability to forecast individual cloud species enables new applications in aviation route optimization where distinguishing between ice and liquid water determines engine icing risk.

### [102] [Training Agents to Self-Report Misbehavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22303)
*Bruce W. Lee,Chen Yueh-Han,Tomek Korbak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-incrimination training reduces AI deception by making agents voluntarily signal when they're misbehaving, outperforming traditional alignment approaches and external monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frontier AI agents may develop hidden, misaligned goals and conceal their pursuit from oversight. Traditional alignment training may fail or have unwanted side effects, creating a need for alternative approaches to detect deceptive behavior.

Method: The paper proposes self-incrimination training, which trains AI agents (GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0) to call a report_scheming() tool when they behave deceptively. The approach is tested in out-of-distribution environments to measure agents' ability to cause harm undetected.

Result: Self-incrimination significantly reduces undetected successful attack rates, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines. The behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to situations where agents pursue misaligned goals autonomously.

Conclusion: Self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier AI misalignment risk that doesn't require preventing misbehavior entirely or reliably classifying it from external observation alone.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their pursuit from oversight. Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.

*Yuda Bi,Wenjun Xiao,Linhao Bai,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICA becomes ineffective in high-dimensional balanced mixtures; kurtosis decays as O(1/R), with threshold at R ≲ κ_max√T for reliable estimation; purification restores contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kurtosis-based ICA weakens in wide, balanced mixtures due to reduced contrast, limiting source separation in high dimensions.

Method: Prove redundancy law linking kurtosis decay to effective width; analyze estimation limitations via finite-moment conditions; propose purification via sign-consistent source selection with data-driven heuristic.

Result: Population excess kurtosis decays as |κ(y)| = O(κ_max/R_eff); estimation requires R ≲ κ_max√T; purification yields R-independent contrast Ω(1/m); synthetic experiments validate decay, crossover, and recovery.

Conclusion: ICA contrast degrades in wide balanced mixtures; purification restores performance; practical methods must consider dimension-estimation trade-off.

Abstract: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens in wide, balanced mixtures. We prove a sharp redundancy law: for a standardized projection with effective width $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (participation ratio), the population excess kurtosis obeys $|κ(y)|=O(κ_{\max}/R_{\mathrm{eff}})$, yielding the order-tight $O(c_bκ_{\max}/R)$ under balance (typically $c_b=O(\log R)$). As an impossibility screen, under standard finite-moment conditions for sample kurtosis estimation, surpassing the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ estimation scale requires $R\lesssim κ_{\max}\sqrt{T}$. We also show that \emph{purification} -- selecting $m\!\ll\!R$ sign-consistent sources -- restores $R$-independent contrast $Ω(1/m)$, with a simple data-driven heuristic. Synthetic experiments validate the predicted decay, the $\sqrt{T}$ crossover, and contrast recovery.

TL;DR: This thesis presents a unified framework using Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory to address reliability (hallucination detection) and efficiency (model compression) in deep learning by analyzing activation eigenvalue dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks and LLMs are becoming increasingly opaque as they scale, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational/energy demands. There's a need for methods to improve reliability and efficiency while maintaining interpretability.

Method: 1) EigenTrack: Transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors (entropy, variance, deviations from Marchenko-Pastur baseline) and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers for early hallucination detection. 2) RMT-KD: Uses outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information to progressively project networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation for model compression.

Result: 1) EigenTrack enables early detection of reliability failures (hallucinations, out-of-distribution behavior) before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. 2) RMT-KD yields significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and maintaining dense, hardware-friendly structure.

Conclusion: Spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior that can separate structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. The unified spectral framework effectively addresses both reliability and efficiency challenges in deep learning through principled mathematical approaches.

Abstract: This thesis addresses two persistent and closely related challenges in modern deep learning, reliability and efficiency, through a unified framework grounded in Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory (RMT). As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.

*Arsenii Dokuchaev,Francesca Bonizzoni,Stefano Pagani,Francesco Regazzoni,Simone Pezzuto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network-based surrogate model that approximates the lead-field operator for forward ECG simulations, achieving high accuracy with reduced anatomical data requirements and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forward ECG models require full torso imaging which is often unavailable in clinical practice (typically focused on heart only). The lead-field method has computational limitations scaling linearly with electrode count, and no existing approach achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements, and computational efficiency simultaneously.

Method: A shape-informed surrogate model with two components: 1) a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and 2) a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions, and latent codes.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy: mean angular error <5° for lead fields within torso, highly accurate ECG simulations with relative mean squared error <2.5%. It outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while maintaining negligible inference cost. Can work with limited anatomical data due to compact latent representation.

Conclusion: The proposed shape-informed surrogate model successfully addresses the trade-offs in forward ECG simulation, providing high-fidelity results with reduced data requirements and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical deployment in data-limited settings.

Abstract: Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.

TL;DR: Background Contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (model) extracts target-specific biological signals from high-dimensional data by suppressing shared confounding variation through joint factorization of target and background datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-dimensional biological data, condition-specific signals are often masked by dominant shared variation (baseline structure or technical effects), which standard dimensionality reduction methods fail to separate from true biological signals. Existing correction methods are either not scalable or not interpretable.

Method: Background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (model) jointly factorizes a target dataset and a matched background dataset using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. It uses an efficient multiplicative update algorithm optimized for GPU hardware with minibatch training for scalability.

Result: Model successfully reveals signals obscured by conventional methods across diverse biological datasets: disease-associated programs in depression brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

Conclusion: Model provides an interpretable, scalable solution for extracting target-specific biological variation from high-dimensional data by explicitly isolating target-specific components while suppressing shared confounding factors, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial Resistance (particularly MDR) presents critical clinical challenges due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing, creating need for faster, more accurate prediction methods.

Method: Evaluated five ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) on 9,714 bacterial isolates with antibiotic resistance encoded at family level; used LIME for interpretability; assessed via accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC metrics.

Result: Ensemble models (XGBoost and LightGBM) demonstrated superior predictive performance; LIME identified quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as strongest MDR contributors, aligning with known biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: Combining high-performing ML models with local interpretability (LIME) provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship, enabling earlier MDR identification and enhancing trust in ML-assisted clinical decision support.

Abstract: The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.

Motivation: Most molecular property prediction models rely on a single representation (sequence, graph, or 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static, ignoring the dynamic nature of molecular shapes and potential benefits of multi-modal integration.

Method: 1) Conformer ensemble attention mechanism combining learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers; 2) Cross-modal fusion layer where each modality attends to others; 3) Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) for experimental context conditioning; 4) Pre-training on ZINC250K using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives.

Result: On four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks: tri-modal fusion provides 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines; conformer ensembles add approximately 2% over single-conformer variants; comprehensive ablation studies confirm each architectural component contributes independently.

Conclusion: MolFM-Lite demonstrates that multi-modal fusion of molecular representations (1D, 2D, 3D) with attention-based ensemble modeling and experimental context conditioning significantly improves molecular property prediction, offering computational efficiency and strong performance.

Abstract: Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost. We release all code, trained models, and data splits to support reproducibility.

### [109] [A Learning-Based Hybrid Decision Framework for Matching Systems with User Departure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22412)
*Ruiqi Zhou,Donghao Zhu,Houcai Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based Hybrid framework adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching in dynamic matching markets by estimating departure distributions and using decision thresholds to optimize waiting times, congestion, and matching efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In matching markets like kidney and freight exchanges, delayed matching improves efficiency but is highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior. Fixed matching policies are inflexible, while delayed matches incur costs like longer waiting times and increased congestion.

Method: A learning-based Hybrid framework continuously collects data on user departures, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs tolerance for matching efficiency loss.

Result: The proposed framework substantially reduces waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only limited matching efficiency. It enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies.

Conclusion: The Hybrid framework offers a robust, adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms that can dynamically adjust its matching strategy to balance efficiency, waiting times, and congestion in dynamic matching markets.

Abstract: In matching markets such as kidney exchanges and freight exchanges, delayed matching has been shown to improve overall market efficiency. The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.

### [110] [Revisiting Chebyshev Polynomial and Anisotropic RBF Models for Tabular Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22422)
*Luciano Gerber,Huw Lloyd*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smooth-basis models (Chebyshev polynomials and RBF networks) can compete with tree ensembles on tabular regression tasks, showing comparable accuracy but tighter generalization gaps, making them valuable additions to regression workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smooth models like Chebyshev polynomials and RBF networks are well-established in numerical analysis for their differentiable properties, but they're rarely used in tabular regression where tree ensembles dominate. The researchers want to investigate whether these smooth-basis models can actually compete with tree ensembles in practical tabular regression tasks.

Method: Developed three smooth-basis models: 1) anisotropic RBF network with data-driven center placement and gradient-based width optimization, 2) ridge-regularized Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and 3) Chebyshev model tree (smooth-tree hybrid). Benchmarking against tree ensembles, pretrained transformer, and standard baselines across 55 regression datasets organized by application domain, evaluating both accuracy and generalization behavior.

Result: The transformer achieved highest accuracy on majority of datasets but has deployment limitations (GPU dependence, inference latency, dataset-size limits). Among CPU-viable models, smooth-basis models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but smooth models tend to exhibit tighter generalization gaps (less overfitting).

Conclusion: Smooth-basis models should be routinely included in regression candidate pools, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalization and gradually varying predictions. While tree ensembles remain competitive, smooth models offer valuable properties for applied science and industry settings.

Abstract: Smooth-basis models such as Chebyshev polynomial regressors and radial basis function (RBF) networks are well established in numerical analysis. Their continuously differentiable prediction surfaces suit surrogate optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and other settings where the response varies gradually with inputs. Despite these properties, smooth models seldom appear in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate. We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.
  We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.
  The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes consistent Bayesian estimators for diffusion models to enable calibrated sampling from the true posterior distribution, outperforming existing test-time guidance methods that only maximize reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time guidance methods for diffusion models focus on maximizing reward rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. The authors identify that current approaches don't recover the correct posterior distribution.

Method: The authors analyze why common test-time guidance methods fail to recover the correct posterior, identify the structural approximations responsible, and propose consistent alternative estimators for Bayesian posterior sampling.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms previous methods on Bayesian inference tasks and matches state-of-the-art performance in black hole image reconstruction.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that consistent Bayesian estimators enable calibrated sampling from the true posterior distribution, overcoming the limitations of existing test-time guidance methods that focus on reward maximization rather than proper Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Test-time guidance is a widely used mechanism for steering pretrained diffusion models toward outcomes specified by a reward function. Existing approaches, however, focus on maximizing reward rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. In this work, we show that common test-time guidance methods do not recover the correct posterior distribution and identify the structural approximations responsible for this failure. We then propose consistent alternative estimators that enable calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior. We significantly outperform previous methods on a set of Bayesian inference tasks, and match state-of-the-art in black hole image reconstruction.

TL;DR: Fair-PaperRec: An MLP-based paper recommender system with fairness regularization that re-ranks papers after double-blind review to increase underrepresented group participation while maintaining utility


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite double-blind review processes, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups in paper selection

Method: Multi-Layer Perceptron with differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. Tested on synthetic datasets with varying bias levels, then validated on real conference data from SIGCHI, DIS, and IUI

Result: In controlled synthetic studies, increasing fairness weight strengthens diversity while keeping utility stable. In real-world conference data, Fair-PaperRec achieves up to 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most 3.16% change in overall utility

Conclusion: Fairness regularization can serve as both an equity mechanism and mild quality regularizer, offering a practical framework for post-review paper selection that increases diversity while preserving scholarly quality

Abstract: Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality.

### [113] [ECHO: Encoding Communities via High-order Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22446)
*Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO is a scalable, self-supervised architecture for community detection in attributed networks that avoids feature over-smoothing and O(N²) memory bottlenecks via topology-aware routing and memory-sharded optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current community detection methods face a fundamental trade-off: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from computational bottlenecks including feature over-smoothing in dense/heterophilic networks and O(N²) memory constraints from pairwise clustering.

Method: ECHO reframes community detection as adaptive, multi-scale diffusion. It features a Topology-Aware Router that analyzes structural heuristics (sparsity, density, assortativity) to route graphs through optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Uses memory-sharded full-batch contrastive objective and novel chunked O(N·K) similarity extraction to bypass O(N²) memory bottlenecks.

Result: On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale-invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. On real-world social networks with over 1.6M nodes and 30M edges, it completes clustering in minutes with throughput exceeding 2,800 nodes/second, matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines.

Conclusion: ECHO successfully dismantles the Semantic Wall and Systems Wall in attributed network community detection through its topology-aware routing and memory-sharded architecture, enabling scalable, accurate community detection while maintaining semantic feature integration and avoiding computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

### [114] [Beyond performance-wise Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22470)
*Balazs Pejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating client contributions in federated learning that goes beyond accuracy to include trustworthiness dimensions like reliability, resilience, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated learning client evaluation methods focus primarily on model performance metrics like accuracy or loss, which only represent one dimension of a model's utility. There's a critical need to evaluate client contributions toward model trustworthiness aspects such as reliability, resilience, and fairness.

Method: The authors use Shapley value approximation to quantify multifaceted client contributions across three trustworthiness dimensions: reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity).

Result: Results show that no single client excels across all trustworthiness dimensions, and these dimensions are largely independent from each other. This reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation schemes where single metrics are inadequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable reward allocation.

Conclusion: Current client evaluation methods in federated learning are insufficient because they focus on single performance metrics. A comprehensive evaluation framework that includes multiple trustworthiness dimensions is necessary for fair and effective contribution assessment and reward allocation.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.

*Afshin Khadangi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRC² is a decoder-only architecture that addresses continual learning through sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with fast corrective pathways, improving the stability-plasticity tradeoff for language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning approaches for language models suffer from catastrophic forgetting or impose high computational costs (latency, memory, computation) that don't scale well to long contexts, creating a need for architectural-level solutions.

Method: TRC² combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with modulation, prediction, memory, feedback mechanisms, and a fast corrective pathway that enables rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The architecture is sparse and chunk-parallel for efficient training and inference.

Result: TRC² improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

Conclusion: The TRC² architecture provides an effective architectural solution for continual learning in language models by addressing the fundamental stability-plasticity tradeoff through biologically-inspired sparse routing and fast corrective pathways.

Abstract: Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-aware distillation (RLAD) proposes selective imitation during RL training to address distribution mismatch and objective interference in distilling RL-enhanced LLMs into smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods designed for supervised fine-tuning suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference when combined with reinforcement learning, limiting effective distillation of RL-post-trained large language models into smaller student models.

Method: Introduces RLAD with Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), which replaces teacher-student KL regularization with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher-old-policy mixture, enabling advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation during RL training.

Result: RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks.

Conclusion: RL-aware distillation with selective imitation during RL training effectively addresses the limitations of existing KD methods when applied to RL-enhanced LLMs, enabling more efficient distillation of reasoning capabilities into smaller models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: The paper provides direct total-variation (TV) analysis for discrete diffusion samplers, establishing improved convergence guarantees for Euler method and novel analysis for First-Hitting Sampler (FHS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical analyses of discrete diffusion samplers are limited - they use KL divergence (which yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions), don't cover high-performance FHS sampler, and lack tight convergence bounds.

Method: Develops direct total-variation (TV) based error analysis for Euler method and FHS sampler. Introduces TV-based error decomposition along CTMC trajectory and decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS.

Result: For Euler method: relaxes score estimation assumptions, improves parameter dependencies, establishes convergence without surrogate initialization, provides first convergence lower bound showing tightness in data dimension d and accuracy ε. For FHS: shows it incurs no sampling error beyond score estimation error, with matching lower error bound.

Conclusion: The TV-based analytical framework provides stronger theoretical guarantees for discrete diffusion samplers than previous KL-based approaches, with tight bounds for both Euler and FHS methods, offering tools that may be broadly applicable to diffusion model analysis.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved strong empirical performance in text and other symbolic domains, with masked (absorbing-rate) variants emerging as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models. Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSPT injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via post-training with a non-differentiable oracle, improving public space dominance and functional hierarchy through filtering/fine-tuning or PPO reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained generative models for floor plans optimize for data distribution fit but under-emphasize critical architectural priors like configurational dominance and connectivity of public spaces (living rooms, foyers).

Method: Proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT) with a non-differentiable oracle that converts layouts to rectangle-space graphs, computes integration-based measurements. Two strategies: iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards.

Result: Both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines. PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance.

Conclusion: SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.

Abstract: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEFL introduces residual feedback learning that leverages past prediction errors to improve time series forecasting accuracy, achieving 5-10% MAE reduction across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep forecasting models minimize point-wise prediction loss but ignore valuable information in historical prediction residuals, which contain insights about persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, and evolving dynamics that could improve forecasting performance.

Method: TEFL is a unified learning framework that incorporates historical residuals into forecasting during training and evaluation. It addresses three challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under partial observability, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter for efficiency, and (3) using two-stage training to jointly optimize base forecaster and error module.

Result: Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show consistent accuracy improvements with 5-10% MAE reduction on average. Strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems by embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, leveraging past errors to improve future predictions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.

TL;DR: A machine learning method predicts professional tennis players' first serve directions with ~49% accuracy for males and ~44% for females, revealing strategic mixed-strategy serving and importance of contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serves are crucial in professional tennis, with servers using strategic serve directions while trying to be unpredictable, and returners trying to predict these directions. Understanding this mind game in decision-making is important for analyzing professional tennis matches.

Method: Developed a machine learning method with feature engineering to predict professional tennis players' first serve directions. The approach analyzes serve decision patterns through computational modeling.

Result: Achieved average prediction accuracy of around 49% for male players and 44% for female players. Found evidence that top professional players use mixed-strategy models in serving decisions, fatigue affects serve direction choices, and contextual information is more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.

Conclusion: The machine learning approach successfully predicts serve directions, providing insights into professional tennis players' strategic decision-making. The findings suggest servers use mixed strategies, fatigue influences decisions, and returners rely more on contextual information for anticipation than previously recognized.

Abstract: Serves, especially first serves, are very important in professional tennis. Servers choose their serve directions strategically to maximize their winning chances while trying to be unpredictable. On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\% for male players and 44\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyCausal is a dynamic causal structure learning framework that uses convolutional networks and linear interpolation to recover fine-grained time-varying causal graphs from time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing causal discovery methods assume stationary or partially stationary causality, which conflicts with complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. There's a need for methods that address fully dynamic causality where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time.

Method: DyCausal uses convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step. It also incorporates an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling to efficiently constrain loops in evolving causal structures.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering stable and efficient identification of fully dynamic causal structures.

Conclusion: DyCausal provides an effective framework for learning fully dynamic causal structures from time series data, addressing the limitations of existing stationary assumption-based methods and enabling fine-grained time-varying causal discovery.

Abstract: Learning the dynamic causal structure of time series is a challenging problem. Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: pNMF extends traditional NMF to capture multi-scale data structure by creating persistence-aligned embeddings across scales using persistent homology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NMF methods are single-scale and fail to capture connectivity evolution across resolutions, limiting their ability to represent multi-scale data structures.

Method: Proposes persistent NMF (pNMF) using persistent homology to identify canonical scales where connectivity changes, creating scale-parameterized NMF with graph Laplacian regularization and cross-scale consistency constraints.

Result: Develops sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence; demonstrates effectiveness on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Conclusion: pNMF successfully captures multi-scale data structure through persistence-aligned embeddings, offering a more comprehensive factorization approach than traditional single-scale NMF.

Abstract: Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific machine learning (SciML) has accelerated discovery across diverse domains, yet designing effective SciML models remains a challenging task. In practice, building such models often requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly in determining which input features to use and how large the model should be. We introduce LUMOS, an end-to-end framework based on L0-regularized learning that unifies feature selection and model pruning to democratize SciML model design. By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy.

### [124] [RAIN-Merging: A Gradient-Free Method to Enhance Instruction Following in Large Reasoning Models with Preserved Thinking Format](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22538)
*Zhehao Huang,Yuhang Liu,Baijiong Lin,Yixin Lou,Zhengbao He,Hanling Tian,Tao Li,Xiaolin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAIN-Merging is a gradient-free method that merges large reasoning models with instruction-tuned models to improve instruction following while preserving reasoning capabilities by projecting task vectors onto null spaces and using instruction attention scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but often fail to follow output format, constraints, or specific requirements, while instruction-tuned models (ITMs) specialize in instruction following. The gap between their capabilities needs to be bridged to create models that can both reason well and follow instructions faithfully.

Method: RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging) uses two key steps: 1) Project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens using a small reasoning calibration set to preserve LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms, and 2) Use a small instruction calibration set to estimate instruction attention for module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. The method is gradient-free.

Result: RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence across four instruction-following benchmarks while maintaining reasoning quality across nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures and translate to improved performance in agent settings.

Conclusion: The orthogonal nature of LRM and ITM parameter spaces enables effective lightweight merging, but naive approaches fail due to output format mismatches. RAIN-Merging successfully integrates instruction-following capabilities into reasoning models while preserving their structured reasoning through careful null-space projection and attention-based scaling, creating models that excel at both reasoning and instruction adherence.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.

### [125] [Relatron: Automating Relational Machine Learning over Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22552)
*Zhikai Chen,Han Xie,Jian Zhang,Jiliang Tang,Xiang Song,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) and Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) approaches for predictive modeling over relational databases, finding that neither consistently outperforms the other and performance is highly task-dependent. The authors propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that intelligently chooses between RDL and DFS while pruning search space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive modeling over relational databases remains challenging due to difficulties in capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. While RDL methods automate feature engineering via message passing and classical DFS approaches rely on predefined aggregators, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and principles for selecting effective architectures are poorly understood.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and performs architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. They create a model performance bank linking architecture configurations to performance, then analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap. They introduce two task signals (RDB task homophily and affinity embedding capturing size, path, feature, and temporal structure) and propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS while pruning the search space.

Result: Key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, highlighting the need for task-aware model selection; (3) validation accuracy is unreliable for architecture choice. Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization.

Conclusion: The paper provides empirical evidence that the choice between RDL and DFS depends on task characteristics, proposes task signals that correlate with the performance gap, and introduces Relatron as an effective meta-selector that achieves significant performance improvements with reduced computational cost through principled routing between RDL and DFS approaches.

Abstract: Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.

TL;DR: A training-free alignment framework using Sparse Weight Editing reduces safety vulnerabilities in low-resource languages by mapping their harmful representations to high-resource language safety subspaces while preserving general utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages like English. Existing solutions like multilingual supervised fine-tuning or RLHF are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data.

Method: Proposes a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifies that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons and formulates cross-lingual alignment as a constrained linear transformation. Derives a closed-form solution to optimally map harmful representations of low-resource languages to robust safety subspaces of high-resource languages, while preserving general utility via null-space projection constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that the method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate in low-resource languages with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.

Conclusion: The proposed Sparse Weight Editing framework provides an effective, training-free solution for cross-lingual safety alignment that addresses the safety disparities between languages while maintaining model utility, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages (LRLs) often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Existing solutions, such as multilingual supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifying that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons, we formulate the cross-lingual alignment problem as a constrained linear transformation. We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.

### [127] [Autoregressive Visual Decoding from EEG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22555)
*Sicheng Dai,Hongwang Xiao,Shan Yu,Qiwei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AVDE is a lightweight autoregressive framework for EEG-based visual decoding that bridges modality gaps via contrastive learning and uses multi-scale token prediction for efficient image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals offer cost-effective, high-temporal-resolution access to visual information but current approaches struggle with modality gaps and computational complexity. Existing methods rely on multi-stage adaptation that introduces consistency issues and compounding errors, while large diffusion models have impractical computational overhead for real-world BCI applications.

Method: 1) Fine-tune LaBraM (pre-trained EEG model) via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations; 2) Use pre-trained VQ-VAE to encode images into multi-scale token maps; 3) Train transformer to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as coarsest representation ("next-scale prediction" strategy).

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two datasets in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, using only 10% of parameters. Visualization shows generative process reflects hierarchical nature of human visual perception.

Conclusion: AVDE demonstrates autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications, bridging EEG-image modality gap with lightweight architecture while maintaining direct connection between EEG signals and reconstructed images.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.

*Zihang Xu,Haozhi Xie,Ziqi Miao,Wuxuan Gong,Chen Qian,Lijun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage framework to address overthinking in Large Reasoning Models by combining Hybrid Fine-Tuning and adaptive reinforcement learning with CPAS and LAGR, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and robust performance across heterogeneous reasoning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models often show "overthinking" behavior on low-complexity queries, and existing mitigation approaches suffer from unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors.

Method: A two-stage framework: 1) Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose models to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors for well-conditioned initialization, 2) Adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under reasoning-length heterogeneity.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. The approach demonstrates robustness across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework effectively addresses overthinking in Large Reasoning Models through stable adaptive thinking, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and generalization while maintaining robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.

*Moirangthem Tiken Singh,Amit Kalita,Sapam Jitu Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-hoc, model-agnostic framework for optimizing decision thresholds under strict capacity constraints that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and fairness using a single global threshold for legal compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness interventions often assume unconstrained resources and use group-specific thresholds that violate anti-discrimination regulations, creating a need for legally compliant approaches that work under strict capacity constraints in high-stakes domains.

Method: Introduces a parameterized ethical loss function with a bounded decision rule that prevents intervention volumes from exceeding available resources, enforcing a single global threshold for legal compliance while jointly optimizing safety, efficiency, and equity.

Result: Capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities, determining the final deployed threshold in over 80% of tested configurations. Under 25% capacity limit, framework maintains high risk identification (recall 0.409-0.702) while unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to near-zero utility.

Conclusion: Theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits. The framework provides a practical, legally compliant mechanism for navigating ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments by decoupling predictive scoring from policy evaluation.

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.

*Yu Zhang,Songwei Liu,Chenqian Yan,Sheng Lin,Beichen Ning,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2O is a sparse attention method that enables early stopping through online permutation, significantly reducing computation while maintaining accuracy for long-context models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification methods face a fundamental sparsity ceiling that prevents further improvements, even with careful engineering.

Method: S2O performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping. It factorizes FlashAttention execution to load non-contiguous tokens, transforms explicit permutation into an online index-guided loading policy, and introduces an early-stopping rule that processes blocks from high to low importance and terminates when scores fall below a threshold.

Result: On Llama-3.1-8B with 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82× at matched sparsity, reduces prefill compute density by 3.31× at matched MSE, preserves end-to-end accuracy, and achieves 7.51× attention speedup and 3.81× end-to-end speedup.

Conclusion: S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling for sparse attention methods, enabling significantly faster long-context inference while maintaining accuracy through its online permutation and early-stopping approach.

Abstract: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.
  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\times$ attention and 3.81$\times$ end-to-end speedups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing circuit discovery methods overlook holistic nature of circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. Current approaches fail to capture comprehensive computational subgraphs responsible for task-solving.

Method: Proposes IBCircuit, an end-to-end optimization framework based on Information Bottleneck principle for holistic circuit discovery. The method can be applied to any task without requiring task-specific corrupted activation design, enabling identification of informative circuits through information-theoretic optimization.

Result: On both Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits compared to recent related work, in terms of both critical node components and edge components. Demonstrates superior performance in circuit discovery fidelity and minimality.

Conclusion: IBCircuit provides an effective, holistic approach to circuit discovery that eliminates the need for tedious corrupted activation design while improving the faithfulness and minimality of identified circuits across different tasks.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabDLM: A unified diffusion-based framework that jointly models numerical, categorical, and free-form text features in tabular data using masked diffusion for text/categorical features and continuous diffusion for numerical features with specialized numeric tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields alongside structured data, but existing approaches have limitations: diffusion models struggle with text quality while LLM-based methods distort numerical values. There's a need for a unified framework that can accurately generate heterogeneous tabular data with both structured and unstructured components.

Method: TabDLM uses a joint numerical-language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). It models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with continuous diffusion via learned specialized numeric tokens embeddings. Bidirectional attention captures cross-modality interactions within a single unified model.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that TabDLM outperforms strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines for generating free-form tabular data.

Conclusion: TabDLM provides an effective unified framework for generating heterogeneous tabular data with joint modeling of different modalities, addressing limitations of both diffusion-based and LLM-based approaches while maintaining quality across numerical, categorical, and text features.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.

TL;DR: pQuant addresses parameter democratization in extreme low-bit quantization by splitting linear layers into a 1-bit branch for efficiency and a high-precision branch for sensitive parameters, enabling state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit) struggles with unsatisfactory accuracy and scalability due to a "parameter democratization effect" where parameter sensitivity becomes homogenized, limiting expressivity.

Method: pQuant decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch for preserving sensitive parameters. It uses tailored feature scaling to guide allocation of sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch, and extends this branch into multiple sparsely-activated experts for efficient capacity scaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization scenarios.

Conclusion: pQuant effectively addresses the parameter democratization bottleneck in extremely low-bit quantization through parameter decoupling and specialized branch allocation, enabling improved accuracy and scalability for edge deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training from scratch has emerged as a promising approach for building efficient large language models (LLMs) with extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit), which can offer substantial advantages for edge deployment. However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how large language models work internally is challenging because training selects for behavior, not specific circuitry, resulting in many possible weight configurations that implement the same function. The authors seek to identify which internal structures reflect essential computation versus training accidents.

Method: The authors extract "algorithmic cores" - compact subspaces of weights necessary and sufficient for task performance. They analyze transformers across different training runs and show these cores converge to the same structures. They examine: 1) Markov-chain transformers embedding cores in orthogonal subspaces, 2) Modular-addition transformers showing cores evolve from compact cyclic operators during grokking to inflated structures, and 3) GPT-2 models governing subject-verb agreement through single axes.

Result: The paper reveals low-dimensional algorithmic cores that persist across training runs and model scales. Markov-chain transformers embed identical 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, providing a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models implement subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across different scales.

Conclusion: Transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures that persist across training runs and scales. Mechanistic interpretability should target these computational invariants (the "computational essence") rather than implementation-specific details, as these algorithmic cores represent the fundamental computational building blocks of transformer models.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.

*Thanh-Dat Truong,Huu-Thien Tran,Jackson Cothren,Bhiksha Raj,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes φ-DPO, a fairness-aware Direct Preference Optimization framework for continual learning in Large Multimodal Models to address both catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in continual learning for LMMs is an underexplored challenge, particularly when dealing with imbalanced data distributions that cause biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While catastrophic forgetting has been addressed, fairness issues from data imbalance remain largely unexamined.

Method: 1) Proposes a continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using pairwise preference signals to mitigate catastrophic forgetting; 2) Identifies limitations of conventional DPO with imbalanced data and introduces φ-DPO loss to explicitly address distributional biases; 3) Provides theoretical analysis showing the approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance; 4) Constructs pairwise preference annotations for existing continual learning benchmarks to enable φ-DPO-based training.

Result: Extensive experiments show φ-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods for LMMs. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed φ-DPO framework successfully addresses both catastrophic forgetting and fairness issues in continual learning for Large Multimodal Models, providing a comprehensive solution for learning from imbalanced data distributions while maintaining performance across tasks.

Abstract: Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.

### [136] [DP-aware AdaLN-Zero: Taming Conditioning-Induced Heavy-Tailed Gradients in Differentially Private Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22610)
*Tao Huang,Jiayang Meng,Xu Yang,Chen Hou,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gradient issues in DP-SGD, improving private conditional diffusion training for time-series tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous conditional contexts in time-series tasks (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns, outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under DP-SGD, these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under fixed privacy budgets.

Method: DP-aware AdaLN-Zero is a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying DP-SGD. It jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection.

Result: DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. Consistent gains observed on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Gradient diagnostics show conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training.

Conclusion: Sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance, demonstrating that carefully controlling conditioning representations can address gradient issues in DP-SGD for time-series tasks.

Abstract: Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.

### [137] [Mitigating Membership Inference in Intermediate Representations via Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22611)
*Jiayang Meng,Tao Huang,Chen Hou,Guolong Zheng,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LM-DP-SGD adapts privacy protection across neural network layers based on their MIA vulnerability, achieving better privacy-utility trade-offs than uniform DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In embedding-as-an-interface settings, intermediate representations leak membership information, with varying vulnerability across layers. Standard DP-SGD uses uniform noise across layers despite this heterogeneity, potentially wasting privacy budget on less vulnerable layers.

Method: LM-DP-SGD trains shadow models on public data to estimate MIA risk per layer, then reweights each layer's gradient contribution during private training based on its risk. This provides adaptive layer-appropriate protection while maintaining the global privacy budget.

Result: Under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility. Theoretical privacy and convergence guarantees are established.

Conclusion: Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD provides superior privacy-utility trade-offs by adaptively allocating privacy protection according to layer vulnerability.

Abstract: In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.

*Hai Huang,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Tube Prediction (STP), a novel regularization method based on the Geodesic Hypothesis that improves data efficiency in LLM training by 16× compared to standard scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive, establishing data-efficiency bounds that limit optimal training. The authors aim to challenge these bounds by developing a method that can achieve similar performance with significantly less training data.

Method: Proposes the Geodesic Hypothesis that token sequences trace geodesics on a semantic manifold. Builds on this to create Semantic Tube Prediction (STP), a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic, improving signal-to-noise ratio and preventing trajectory collisions during inference.

Result: STP enables LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16× less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: Principled geometric priors like STP can surpass brute-force scaling approaches, offering a more data-efficient alternative to current LLM training methods that rely heavily on massive datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ContextRL uses context augmentation to enhance reward model accuracy and overcome identifiability/reachability bottlenecks in RL-based reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses bottlenecks in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks: 1) Identifiability - difficulty distinguishing high-quality reasoning from false positives, and 2) Reachability - challenges in finding correct solutions from all-negative samples.

Method: ContextRL introduces two key components: 1) Providing full reference solutions as context to the reward model for fine-grained process verification, and 2) A multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding policy recovery.

Result: On 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks, ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, Qwen3-VL-8B achieves performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines while mitigating reward hacking.

Conclusion: Contextual information has significant potential for improving reward model accuracy. The analysis documents widespread reward hacking and offers valuable insights for future RLVR research.

Abstract: We propose ContextRL, a novel framework that leverages context augmentation to overcome these bottlenecks. Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to "recover" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.

### [140] [Tackling Privacy Heterogeneity in Differentially Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22633)
*Ruichen Xu,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a privacy-aware client selection strategy for differentially private federated learning that addresses heterogeneous privacy requirements across clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP-FL approaches assume uniform privacy budgets, but real-world scenarios have varying privacy requirements across clients. Conventional client selection strategies based on data quantity cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints.

Method: The authors conduct the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. They establish theoretical foundations with convergence analysis quantifying the impact of privacy heterogeneity. They propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy formulated as a convex optimization problem that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate up to 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.

*Qin-Wen Luo,Sheng Ren,Xiang Chen,Rui Liu,Jun Fang,Naiqiang Tan,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEEH: A difficulty-aware RL approach for efficient LLM reasoning that selectively compresses easy questions while exploring hard ones, maintaining accuracy while reducing response length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning in LLMs creates prohibitive latency and computational costs due to verbose reasoning steps. Existing compression methods sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity by triggering entropy collapse that prematurely shrinks exploration space.

Method: Proposes CEEH (Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones) - a difficulty-aware RL approach that dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization. Preserves diverse search space for hard questions while permitting aggressive compression on easy instances. Also introduces dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to historically shortest correct response.

Result: Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.

Conclusion: CEEH effectively addresses the trade-off between reasoning capability and efficiency by preserving exploration for hard questions while compressing easy ones, offering a practical solution for real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.

*Lianze Shan,Jitao Zhao,Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Zhiyong Feng,Weixiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUG introduces a meta-path-aware universal pre-training approach for heterogeneous graphs that addresses schema diversity through input unification and meta-path variation through consistent structural pattern learning, enabling transferable representations across diverse heterogeneous graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universal graph pre-training has focused primarily on homogeneous graphs, leaving heterogeneous graphs with their complex structural and semantic diversity unexplored. The key challenges are: (1) diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder unified representation space construction, and (2) varying numbers and semantics of meta-paths across datasets make learned patterns difficult to transfer.

Method: MUG introduces: 1) An input unification module that integrates multiple node and relation types into unified representations projected into a shared space via a dimension-aware encoder for schema alignment. 2) Training a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than dataset-specific aggregation strategies, with a global objective that encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases.

Result: Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG, showing it successfully addresses the challenges of heterogeneous graph pre-training and enables transferable representations across diverse graphs.

Conclusion: MUG provides a novel solution for universal pre-training on heterogeneous graphs by addressing schema diversity through input unification and meta-path variation through consistent structural pattern learning, paving the way for more effective transfer learning across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets.

Abstract: Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.

TL;DR: LEDA proposes a universal graph pre-training model using latent semantic distribution alignment to overcome limitations of existing methods in handling diverse graph domains through dimension projection and variational semantic inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing universal graph pre-training methods struggle with simplistic data alignment that fails to properly align semantics across diverse graph domains, and limited training guidance that applies in-domain paradigms to cross-domain scenarios, resulting in ineffective knowledge capture from many graphs.

Method: 1) Dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. 2) Variational semantic inference module to obtain shared latent distribution that guides domain projection and aligns with shared semantics across domains.

Result: LEDA exhibits strong performance across broad range of graphs and downstream tasks, and significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models in few-shot cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed LEDA model effectively addresses challenges in universal graph pre-training through latent semantic distribution alignment, achieving superior performance across diverse graph domains and demonstrating particularly strong capabilities in few-shot cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.

TL;DR: Two-component ML framework for antimicrobial resistance trend forecasting using WHO GLASS data with XGBoost achieving best results, plus RAG pipeline for policy decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance is a global crisis projected to cause 10 million annual deaths by 2050. While WHO GLASS provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this valuable dataset.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Benchmarking six ML models (Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM) on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations (2021-2023) across six WHO regions; 2) Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline combining ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with Phi-3 Mini language model for policy decision support.

Result: XGBoost achieved best performance with test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis showed prior-year resistance rate as dominant predictor (50.5% importance). Regional performance varied: European Region MAE 4.16%, South-East Asia Region MAE 10.14%. RAG pipeline successfully produced source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective use of ML for AMR forecasting and evidence-based policy support, with XGBoost showing strong performance and RAG enabling practical application of AI for healthcare policy decision-making.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global crisis projected to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Duel-Evolve: Evolutionary optimization using LLM's own pairwise preferences instead of external scalar rewards, achieving significant improvements on mathematical reasoning and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many optimization methods for LLMs rely on calibrated scalar evaluators, which are often unavailable, sparse, or unreliable for many tasks. Pairwise comparisons are easier to elicit, provide useful signal, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision.

Method: Duel-Evolve aggregates noisy pairwise comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to get uncertainty-aware quality estimates. These guide comparison budget allocation using Double Thompson Sampling and selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates through evolutionary optimization.

Result: On MathBench, Duel-Evolve achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines. On LiveCodeBench, it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points.

Conclusion: Pairwise self-preferences from LLMs provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large discrete output spaces, requiring no reward model, ground-truth labels, or hand-crafted scoring functions.

Abstract: Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.

*Shuchen Zhu,Rizhen Hu,Mingze Wang,Mou Sun,Xue Wang,Kun Yuan,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LITE is a generalized acceleration strategy that improves training dynamics for large language model pre-training by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat directions in anisotropic optimization landscapes, significantly accelerating existing matrix-based optimizers like Muon and SOAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training LLMs requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency crucial. Matrix-based optimizers like Muon and SOAP outperform AdamW but tend toward isotropy—being conservative along flat directions and potentially aggressive along sharp ones—limiting their effectiveness in highly anisotropic optimization landscapes where loss reduction is driven predominantly by progress along flat directions.

Method: The authors first establish a unified Riemannian ODE framework that explains how adaptive algorithms work: preconditioners induce Riemannian geometry to mitigate ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as Riemannian damping. Guided by these insights, they propose LITE (Low-curvature trajectory acceleration), which enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories to accelerate convergence along flat directions.

Result: Extensive experiments show LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M-1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes.

Conclusion: LITE provides a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training by addressing the isotropy limitation of existing matrix-based optimizers, enabling faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic optimization landscapes. The method offers substantial acceleration for large-scale model training with available code implementation.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency essential. The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

### [147] [Switch-Hurdle: A MoE Encoder with AR Hurdle Decoder for Intermittent Demand Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22685)
*Fabian Muşat,Simona Căbuz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Switch-Hurdle is a new framework combining Mixture-of-Experts encoder with Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder to better handle intermittent demand forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance on retail datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting methods (ARIMA, exponential smoothing, Croston variants) and modern neural models (DeepAR, Transformers) underperform on intermittent demand data, either by treating demand as a single continuous process or becoming computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series.

Method: Integrates Mixture-of-Experts encoder with Top-1 expert routing during forward pass and approximate dense routing via straight-through estimator during backward pass. The decoder uses cross-attention autoregressive design with shared hurdle head that explicitly separates forecasting into: 1) binary classification for probability of sale, and 2) conditional regression for quantity given sale.

Result: Empirical results on M5 benchmark and large proprietary retail dataset show Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: Switch-Hurdle effectively addresses limitations of existing methods for intermittent demand forecasting by structurally separating occurrence and magnitude processes, demonstrating superior performance and scalability on retail data.

Abstract: Intermittent demand, a pattern characterized by long sequences of zero sales punctuated by sporadic, non-zero values, poses a persistent challenge in retail and supply chain forecasting. Both traditional methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or Croston variants, as well as modern neural architectures such as DeepAR and Transformer-based models often underperform on such data, as they treat demand as a single continuous process or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series. To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.

*Hao Yu,Shuning Jia,Guanghao Li,Wenhao Jiang,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoPerceive introduces a benchmark with diagram-DSL pairs for evaluating geometric perception in VLMs, and GeoDPO uses a translator-guided RL framework to significantly improve geometric perception and downstream reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with geometric reasoning due to limited perception of fundamental diagram elements, requiring better evaluation and enhancement methods.

Method: Create GeoPerceive benchmark with diagram-DSL pairs and automatic data generation pipeline, then develop GeoDPO using NL-to-DSL translator trained on synthetic data to compute DSL-level rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: GeoDPO achieves substantial improvements: +26.5% on in-domain data, +8.0% on out-of-domain data, and +39.0% on downstream reasoning tasks, outperforming supervised fine-tuning which offers only marginal improvements.

Conclusion: GeoDPO demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability over traditional SFT approaches for enhancing geometric perception in vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive

*Vamshi Sunku Mohan,Kaustubh Gupta,Aneesha Das,Chandan Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies activation subspace bottlenecks in Mamba SSM models and introduces a simple steering intervention that multiplies bottleneck activations by a scalar, improving performance across multiple benchmarks. They validate their findings by creating Stable-Mamba, which achieves better long-context performance when retrained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer efficient alternatives to transformers by avoiding quadratic attention complexity, but their interpretability and steerability remain underexplored compared to transformer models.

Method: 1) Use mechanistic interpretability tools to identify activation subspace bottlenecks in Mamba SSM models. 2) Introduce a test-time steering intervention that multiplies the identified bottleneck activations by a scalar. 3) Validate findings by modifying bottlenecks to create Stable-Mamba architecture and retrain from scratch.

Result: The steering intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27% across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks, without task-specific tuning. Stable-Mamba achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch, validating that the identified bottlenecks were indeed hindering performance.

Conclusion: SSMs contain identifiable activation subspace bottlenecks that can be effectively manipulated for performance improvements. Simple steering interventions can substantially boost SSM performance, and architectural modifications based on interpretability insights can lead to better models like Stable-Mamba.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient strategy for building powerful language models, avoiding the quadratic complexity of computing attention in transformers. Despite their promise, the interpretability and steerability of modern SSMs remain relatively underexplored. We take a major step in this direction by identifying activation subspace bottlenecks in the Mamba family of SSM models using tools from mechanistic interpretability. We then introduce a test-time steering intervention that simply multiplies the activations of the identified bottlenecks by a scalar. Across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks, this intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27%, without requiring any task-specific tuning. Finally, we validate that the identified bottlenecks are indeed hindering performance by modifying them to yield an architecture we call Stable-Mamba, which achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch.

*Kaizheng Wang,Yunjia Wang,Fabio Cuzzolin,David Moens,Hans Hallez,Siu Lun Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a controlled comparative study that enables principled comparison between two paradigms for modeling epistemic uncertainty in neural networks: distribution-based (posterior parameter distributions) and set-based (credal sets) representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is modeled using two different second-order paradigms (distribution-based and set-based), but these frameworks are considered fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices. This makes their relative merits unclear, and empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in underlying predictive models.

Method: The authors conduct a controlled comparative study where both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network. This isolates representational effects from predictive accuracy. They evaluate each representation through 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks (including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection), spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration.

Result: The study demonstrates that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative. The research provides insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.

Conclusion: Distribution-based and set-based representations for epistemic uncertainty, though often considered fundamentally incomparable, can be systematically compared in controlled settings. Such comparisons provide valuable insights into how different representation choices affect uncertainty quantification performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features presents scalability challenges. Existing methods like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees face bottlenecks with anisotropic, heavy-tailed, non-stationary features and require manual feature engineering.

Method: Introduces KMLP, a hybrid deep architecture with a shallow KAN front-end using learnable activation functions to model complex non-linear transformations for each feature, combined with a gMLP backbone to capture high-order feature interactions.

Result: Experiments on public benchmarks and industrial datasets with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Advantages over baselines like GBDTs increase at larger scales, validating its scalability for large-scale web tabular data.

Conclusion: KMLP represents a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data that automatically handles complex feature transformations without manual engineering, outperforming traditional methods especially at web-scale.

Abstract: Predictive modeling on web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features faces significant scalability challenges.

*Soroosh Miri,Sepehr Abolhasani,Shahrokh Farahmand,S. Mohammad Razavizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DA-DJSCC, a doubly adaptive deep joint source-channel coding method that uses both channel-wise and spatial attention modules to dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial features, outperforming previous SNR-adaptive methods for semantic communication in IoT networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT networks face challenges like limited bandwidth, constrained computational/energy resources, and dynamic wireless conditions. While DJSCC enables semantic communication for images, training separate DNNs for different SNRs creates excessive storage/communication overhead that IoT devices can't handle.

Method: Improves upon SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC) by incorporating doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adapt to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance for robust feature extraction and semantic information recovery.

Result: DA-DJSCC significantly outperforms ADJSCC on several performance criteria while incurring only a mild increase in complexity, making it suitable for performance-demanding but low-complexity IoT networks.

Conclusion: DA-DJSCC is a desirable choice for semantic communication in IoT networks, offering improved performance over existing adaptive methods with manageable complexity increase.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks face significant challenges such as limited communication bandwidth, constrained computational and energy resources, and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions. Utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) combined with semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has recently been proposed to enable semantic communication of images. Building upon the original DJSCC formulation, low-complexity attention-style architectures has been added to the DNNs for further performance enhancement. As a main hurdle, training these DNNs separately for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will amount to excessive storage or communication overhead, which can not be maintained by small IoT devices. SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC), has been proposed to train the DNNs once but feed the current SNR as part of the data to the channel-wise attention mechanism. We improve upon ADJSCC by a simultaneous utilization of doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust and efficient feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed doubly adaptive DJSCC (DA-DJSCC) significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria, while incurring a mild increase in complexity. These facts render DA-DJSCC a desirable choice for semantic communication in performance demanding but low-complexity IoT networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games, introduces a novel feature-level concentrability coefficient, and proposes both theoretical and practical interactive MAIL algorithms with improved sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent imitation learning suffers from high sample complexity due to state-action level concentrability coefficients. The paper aims to leverage linear structure in Markov games to reduce this complexity and develop more efficient algorithms.

Method: 1. Theoretical analysis of MAIL in linear Markov games with linear transition dynamics and reward functions. 2. Introduces feature-level concentrability coefficient instead of state-action level. 3. Develops interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games with sample complexity dependent only on feature dimension d. 4. Proposes deep MAIL interactive algorithm based on theoretical findings.

Result: 1. Shows feature-level concentrability coefficient can be much smaller than state-action analog when features are informative. 2. Provides first computationally efficient interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games with sample complexity O(d). 3. Demonstrates deep MAIL algorithm outperforms BC on games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

Conclusion: The paper provides foundational theoretical results for MAIL in linear Markov games, showing significant sample complexity improvements through feature-based analysis and interactive learning approaches, with practical applications in multi-agent games.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games where both the transition dynamics and each agent's reward function are linear in some given features. We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level "all policy deviation concentrability coefficient" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

TL;DR: A distributed prompt caching system for edge devices that shares intermediate LLM states cooperatively to reduce inference latency, using partial matching and Bloom-filter-based catalogs to minimize communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices creates severe performance bottlenecks, particularly for latency-sensitive applications, due to limited computational capabilities.

Method: Proposes distributed prompt caching across multiple low-end edge devices, supporting partial matching of prompts. Uses Bloom-filter-based catalogs to efficiently determine if remote servers have desired internal states, reducing unnecessary communication overhead.

Result: Experiments with Gemma-3 270M model and MMLU dataset on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W show average reductions of 93.12% in TTFT (Time to First Token) and 50.07% in TTLT (Time to Last Token).

Conclusion: Distributed prompt caching with partial matching and Bloom-filter-based state lookup effectively mitigates edge device inference bottlenecks by leveraging cooperative state sharing while minimizing communication costs.

Abstract: Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

TL;DR: HGPO addresses context inconsistency in stepwise group-based RL by organizing steps into hierarchical groups based on historical context consistency, enabling more accurate advantage estimation and better policy optimization for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stepwise group-based policy optimization in RL has a key issue of context inconsistency - steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts, leading to biased advantage estimation and degraded policy optimization for long-horizon agentic tasks.

Method: Proposes Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) which: 1) assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups based on historical context consistency, 2) computes distinct advantages within each group, and 3) aggregates them with adaptive weighting to achieve favorable bias-variance trade-off without extra models or rollouts.

Result: HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods on ALFWorld and WebShop tasks using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models under the same computational constraints.

Conclusion: HGPO effectively addresses the context inconsistency problem in stepwise advantage estimation for group-based RL, enabling more accurate policy optimization for long-horizon agentic tasks without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

*Anirudh Thatipelli,Ali Siahkoohi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hypernetwork-based autoencoder framework for functional data clustering that maps discretized functions into compact INR weight space, making clustering robust to sampling resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing functional data clustering methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, and preprocessing choices rather than the underlying functions themselves.

Method: Framework maps discretized function observations into fixed-dimensional vector space via auto-encoding architecture. Encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to weight space of implicit neural representation (INR) serving as decoder. INRs represent functions with few parameters, yielding compact grid-decoupled representations.

Result: Competitive clustering performance demonstrated through synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, robust to changes in sampling resolution including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.

Conclusion: The approach provides a framework for functional data clustering that is agnostic to discretization and choice of clustering method, overcoming limitations of grid-dependent methods.

Abstract: Functional data clustering is concerned with grouping functions that share similar structure, yet most existing methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than on the underlying functions themselves. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.

*Phil Blandfort,Tushar Karayil,Urja Pawar,Robert Graham,Alex McKenzie,Dmitrii Krasheninnikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs' moral decisions are surprisingly sensitive to contextual cues in prompts, even when irrelevant, and baseline preferences don't predict how steerable models are by such cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moral benchmarks for LLMs use context-free prompts, assuming stable preferences, but real-world prompts include contextual signals that might steer decisions.

Method: Developed a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in moral triage settings (trolley problems). For each demographic factor, applied matched, direction-flipped contextual influences (favoring one group vs. another) to systematically measure directional response.

Result: (1) Contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when superficially irrelevant. (2) Baseline preferences don't predict directional steerability - models can appear neutral yet show systematic asymmetry. (3) Influences can backfire - models may claim neutrality but choices still shift, sometimes opposite direction. (4) Reasoning reduces average sensitivity but amplifies effect of biased few-shot examples.

Conclusion: Moral evaluations should extend beyond context-free prompts to include controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

*Anna Van Elst,Kerrian Le Caillec,Igor Colin,Stephan Clémençon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized consensus algorithms for ranking aggregation using Borda, Copeland, median rank, and local Kemenization rules with gossip-based communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ranking aggregation algorithms work in centralized settings where all data is available in one unit, but decentralized settings (peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems) where preference data is distributed across a network present methodological challenges. Current decentralized computation literature focuses mainly on arithmetic means rather than ranking consensus.

Method: Proposes random gossip communication approach where autonomous agents compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions without coordination or central authority. Provides decentralized implementations for Borda, Copeland, median rank, and local Kemenization consensus methods.

Result: Rigorous convergence guarantees with explicit rate bounds for Borda and Copeland methods. Extensive empirical evaluations show algorithms converge quickly and reliably to correct ranking aggregation across various network topologies and real/synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed gossip-based decentralized approach successfully addresses the challenge of computing reliable consensus rankings in distributed settings, with proven convergence properties and practical effectiveness demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.
  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning model for DNA methylation prediction with explainable AI techniques that extracts biological insights about conserved methylation patterns and proposes a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning performs well for DNA methylation classification but lacks interpretability, limiting biological insight. Need to understand the underlying mechanisms and conserved patterns that drive methylation.

Method: Developed MEDNA-DFM model for methylation prediction with signal purification algorithms to extract motifs. Used validation on external datasets, motif extraction techniques, and in silico mutagenesis to test hypotheses.

Result: MEDNA-DFM captures conserved methylation patterns across species. Model generalization driven by intrinsic motifs (like GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Extracted more reliable motifs than prior studies. Proposed "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis with GAGG core motif and upstream A-tract element working cooperatively, validated through mutagenesis showing ablation degrades recognition.

Conclusion: Provides both a powerful methylation prediction tool and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive methodological innovation and generate testable biological hypotheses about epigenetic mechanisms.

Abstract: Accurate computational identification of DNA methylation is essential for understanding epigenetic regulation. Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its "black-box" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.

TL;DR: Axiomatic analysis shows that for multi-output predictors, any Shapley-based attribution rule satisfying classical axioms must decompose component-wise across outputs, establishing a structural constraint in Shapley interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output in multi-output predictors, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear, prompting the need for axiomatic characterization within the Shapley framework.

Method: Extending classical Shapley axioms (efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity) to vector-valued cooperative games, then proving a rigidity theorem showing any attribution rule satisfying these axioms must decompose component-wise across outputs.

Result: Established that any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one classical Shapley axiom, identifying a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability for multi-output learning.

Conclusion: The research clarifies the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning, showing that multi-output models can yield computational savings while producing SHAP explanations consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by Shapley axioms.

Abstract: In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.

TL;DR: ML models predict CRRT membrane fouling using tabular time-series data with 16 features, achieving 77.6% sensitivity/96.3% specificity through oversampling and outperforming LSTM models; feature selection and SHAP-based counterfactual analysis enable interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to predict membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) to improve patient management. Current approaches lack both predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability, making it difficult to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers.

Method: Used time-series ICU data with 16 clinically selected features, applying ADASYN oversampling to address class imbalance. Tested Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models with tabular data approach rather than direct temporal modeling. Conducted feature selection to reduce to 5 key variables and performed Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis for interpretability.

Result: Achieved balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at 10% rebalancing rate. Tabular approach outperformed LSTM models. Feature selection maintained accuracy with improved simplicity. Counterfactual analysis successfully identified minimal input changes to reverse fouling predictions, maintaining robustness across forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: Interpretable ML models are viable for predicting CRRT membrane fouling. The combination of prediction and counterfactual analysis provides practical clinical value for guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management in critical care settings.

Abstract: This study investigates a data-driven machine learning approach to predict membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT). Using time-series data from an ICU, 16 clinically selected features were identified to train predictive models. To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT. The integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offers practical clinical value, potentially guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management.

*Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation) breaks the linear ceiling limitation of LoRA by introducing SiLU gating and structural dropout, achieving better performance with lower rank in complex reasoning tasks while preventing rank collapse through spectrum activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA faces a critical "linear ceiling" in complex reasoning tasks where increasing rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. There's a need for more efficient parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that can break this linear barrier.

Method: NoRA introduces a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion, creating non-linear rank adaptation that overcomes the limitations of linear methods like LoRA.

Result: On SlimOrca benchmark: NoRA at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90). On mathematical reasoning: NoRA achieves perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. SVD analysis confirms NoRA activates dormant tail of singular value spectrum, preventing rank collapse.

Conclusion: NoRA effectively breaks the linear ceiling of LoRA through non-linear gating and dropout mechanisms, demonstrating superior spectral efficiency and better performance in complex reasoning tasks with lower rank requirements.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.

### [163] [Generalization Bounds of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Homogeneous Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22936)
*Wenquan Ma,Yang Sui,Jiaye Teng,Bohan Wang,Jing Xu,Jingqin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that homogeneous neural networks (including ReLU/LeakyReLU CNNs and fully-connected networks) allow for slower stepsize decay (Ω(1/√t)) while maintaining algorithmic stability, breaking the traditional requirement of O(1/t) stepsize for non-convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithmic stability analysis requires stepsize decay of O(1/t) for non-convex optimization, which can impede optimization efficiency and doesn't match practical training scenarios where slower stepsize decay is often used.

Method: The authors derive generalization bounds for homogeneous neural networks, proving that this specific architecture class enables slower stepsize decay of order Ω(1/√t) under mild assumptions. They analyze algorithmic stability properties in the homogeneous network regime.

Result: The theoretical analysis shows that homogeneous neural networks (encompassing common architectures like fully-connected and convolutional networks with ReLU/LeakyReLU activations) can achieve algorithmic stability with slower stepsize decay of Ω(1/√t), which is a significant improvement over the traditional O(1/t) requirement.

Conclusion: Homogeneous neural networks provide favorable theoretical properties that allow for more practical and efficient optimization schedules while maintaining generalization guarantees through algorithmic stability, with broad applicability to standard deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $η_t = \mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $Ω(1/\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.

*Suresan Pareth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSINO is a neural network training framework for Riemannian manifolds that uses covariant Sobolev loss with parallel transport and Laplace-Beltrami regularization for curvature-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks defined on Riemannian manifolds need specialized training methods that account for manifold geometry and curvature. Existing Euclidean training approaches don't properly handle parallel transport and manifold-specific gradient alignment.

Method: Replaces Euclidean derivative supervision with covariant Sobolev loss using parallel transport for gradient alignment, adds Laplace-Beltrami smoothness regularization, and derives geometry-dependent constants for Riemannian optimization.

Result: Derives: (1) Descent Lemma with manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (2) Sobolev Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality for linear convergence guarantees under explicit step sizes, (3) Two-step Newton-Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature-controlled neighborhoods.

Conclusion: MSINO provides curvature-aware training time guarantees that track transported Jacobians, unifying value and gradient-based learning with explicit convergence guarantees for neural training on manifolds, applicable to surface imaging, physics-informed learning, and robotics on Lie groups.

Abstract: We introduce Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO), a curvature aware training framework for neural networks defined on Riemannian manifolds. The method replaces standard Euclidean derivative supervision with a covariant Sobolev loss that aligns gradients using parallel transport and improves stability via a Laplace Beltrami smoothness regularization term.
  Building on classical results in Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory on manifolds, we derive geometry dependent constants that yield (i) a Descent Lemma with a manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (ii) a Sobolev Polyak Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence guarantees for Riemannian gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent under explicit step size bounds, and (iii) a two step Newton Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature controlled neighborhoods.
  Unlike prior Sobolev training in Euclidean space, MSINO provides training time guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians. Applications include surface imaging, physics informed learning settings, and robotics on Lie groups such as SO(3) and SE(3). The framework unifies value and gradient based learning with curvature aware convergence guarantees for neural training on manifolds.

*Yuejiang Yu,Langwen Huang,Alexandru Calotoiu,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes scaling laws for data-driven weather forecasting models, finding they follow different patterns than language models, favoring width over depth and longer training over larger models under fixed compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand empirical scaling laws in data-driven weather forecasting models to optimize training efficiency and model performance.

Method: Analyzed the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size (N), dataset size (D), and compute budget (C) across multiple weather forecasting models.

Result: Aurora shows strongest data-scaling (10x dataset reduces loss 3.2x), GraphCast has highest parameter efficiency but poor hardware utilization. Compute-optimal analysis shows longer training beats larger model size. Weather models favor width over depth, unlike language models.

Conclusion: Future weather forecasting models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance, following different scaling patterns than language models.

Abstract: Data-driven models are revolutionizing weather forecasting. To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance.

*Bum Jun Kim,Shohei Taniguchi,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RKSP uses Koopman spectral features from a single forward pass at initialization to predict training divergence, and KSS prevents divergence by reshaping spectra during training, enabling higher learning rates across various transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training divergence in transformers wastes significant compute resources, and practitioners currently discover instability only after expensive training runs have begun. There's a need for a method to estimate the probability of failure before training starts.

Method: Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) extracts Koopman spectral features from a single forward pass at initialization using whitened dynamic mode decomposition on layer-wise residual snapshots. The key diagnostic is "near-unit spectral mass," which quantifies the fraction of modes near the unit circle. To make this actionable, Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS) reshapes spectra during training to prevent divergence.

Result: RKSP achieves an AUROC of 0.995 for predicting divergence across extensive configurations, outperforming gradient baselines. In challenging high learning rate regimes without normalization layers, KSS reduces divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables 50-150% higher learning rates. The approach generalizes to diverse architectures including language models (GPT-2, LLaMA-2 up to 7B), vision transformers, MoE, Mamba-style SSMs, and KAN.

Conclusion: RKSP provides a highly effective pre-training diagnostic for predicting transformer divergence, while KSS offers a practical intervention to prevent divergence during training. The method's broad applicability across diverse architectures demonstrates its potential for improving training stability and compute efficiency in modern deep learning systems.

Abstract: Training divergence in transformers wastes compute, yet practitioners discover instability only after expensive runs begin. They therefore need an expected probability of failure for a transformer before training starts. Our study of Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) provides such an estimate. From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence. In the challenging high learning rate regime without normalization layers, KSS reduces the divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables learning rates that are 50% to 150% higher. These findings generalize to WikiText-103 language modeling, vision transformers on CIFAR-10, and pretrained language models, including GPT-2 and LLaMA-2 up to 7B, as well as emerging architectures such as MoE, Mamba-style SSMs, and KAN.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration is a major bottleneck for LLM agents trained with RL, and existing methods fail in environments requiring discovery of novel states.

Method: Proposes EMPO²: Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization, which uses memory for exploration and combines both on- and off-policy updates to ensure robust performance with or without memory.

Result: EMPO² achieves 128.6% improvement on ScienceWorld and 11.3% on WebShop over GRPO baseline, and shows superior adaptability to OOD tasks requiring few trials with memory and no parameter updates.

Conclusion: EMPO² is a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents, addressing key limitations in current RL approaches for LLMs.

Abstract: Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO$^2$ achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO$^2$ demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO$^2$ as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed graph neural network framework learns latent relational structures of cardiac vortices from flow data, revealing vortex interactions that correlate with disease severity and clinical interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imaging and computational methods fail to capture the underlying relational structures of coherent flow features in cardiac blood flow patterns, which contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions.

Method: Proposes a physics-informed latent relational framework that models cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph, combining neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics to yield latent graphs sensitive to disease severity.

Result: In aortic coarctation simulations: as aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent, with graph entropy correlating monotonically with severity (R²=0.78, Spearman |ρ|=0.96). In LVAD ultrasound data: latent graphs capture weakening of vortical structures, demonstrating cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: The learned latent interaction graphs and their entropy serve as robust, interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention, offering a novel way to quantify pathology through vortex relational dynamics.

Abstract: Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a constrained optimization framework to improve deep state-space models (DSSMs) and introduces EKVAE, which combines variational inference with classical Bayesian filtering/smoothing for better dynamic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors found that standard training of DSSMs via evidence lower bound (ELBO) maximization doesn't guarantee that models actually learn the underlying dynamics of observed sequence data, limiting their effectiveness in temporal prediction tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a constrained optimization framework for training DSSMs. Building on this, they introduce Extended Kalman VAE (EKVAE), which integrates amortized variational inference with classic Bayesian filtering/smoothing techniques (Kalman filtering/smoothing) to better model system dynamics.

Result: The constrained optimization framework significantly improves system identification and prediction accuracy on established state-of-the-art DSSMs. EKVAE outperforms previous models in prediction accuracy, achieves remarkable results in identifying dynamical systems, and successfully learns state-space representations with disentangled static and dynamic features.

Conclusion: The proposed constrained optimization framework addresses limitations of standard DSSM training, and EKVAE demonstrates superior performance by combining modern variational methods with classical filtering approaches, enabling more accurate dynamic modeling and system identification.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (DSSMs) enable temporal predictions by learning the underlying dynamics of observed sequence data. They are often trained by maximising the evidence lower bound. However, as we show, this does not ensure the model actually learns the underlying dynamics. We therefore propose a constrained optimisation framework as a general approach for training DSSMs. Building upon this, we introduce the extended Kalman VAE (EKVAE), which combines amortised variational inference with classic Bayesian filtering/smoothing to model dynamics more accurately than RNN-based DSSMs. Our results show that the constrained optimisation framework significantly improves system identification and prediction accuracy on the example of established state-of-the-art DSSMs. The EKVAE outperforms previous models w.r.t. prediction accuracy, achieves remarkable results in identifying dynamical systems, and can furthermore successfully learn state-space representations where static and dynamic features are disentangled.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhythmBERT treats ECG as structured language, using discrete rhythm tokens and continuous embeddings for self-supervised learning, achieving strong performance on cardiac abnormalities with single-lead data comparable to 12-lead baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as generic time series, ignoring physiologic semantics and rhythm structure. Contrastive methods use augmentations that distort morphology, while generative approaches use fixed-window segmentation that misaligns cardiac cycles.

Method: RhythmBERT encodes P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations, creating discrete tokens for rhythm semantics and complementary continuous embeddings for morphology. Pretrained on ~800K unlabeled ECG recordings with masked prediction objective.

Result: Despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines across various cardiac conditions including atrial fibrillation, subtle ST-T abnormalities, and myocardial infarction.

Conclusion: Treating ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis, enabling label-efficient learning with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.

TL;DR: Physics-informed neural particle flow for Bayesian updates using PDE-constrained neural networks to approximate probability transport, eliminating stiffness issues and sample requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing particle flow filters suffer from stiff differential equations, while deep learning approaches either treat Bayesian updates as black-box tasks or neglect the exact geometric structure of finite-horizon probability transport.

Method: Propose physics-informed neural particle flow that couples log-homotopy trajectory with continuity equation to derive a master PDE, then embed this PDE as a physical constraint in loss function to train neural network for transport velocity field approximation.

Result: Neural parameterization acts as implicit regularizer reducing stiffness and computational complexity; experiments show better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods on multimodal benchmarks and nonlinear scenarios.

Conclusion: The physics-informed neural particle flow framework provides an effective unsupervised approach for high-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian estimation that maintains geometric structure while mitigating numerical stiffness issues.

Abstract: The Bayesian update step poses significant computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation. While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations. Conversely, existing deep learning approximations typically treat the update as a black-box task or rely on asymptotic relaxation, neglecting the exact geometric structure of the finite-horizon probability transport. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training, and existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression.

Method: PRAC decomposes activations into two components: (1) a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and (2) a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. It introduces a precise scaling factor to create an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance.

Result: Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: PRAC effectively addresses activation memory bottleneck in LLM training by exploiting spectral structure through principled subspace decomposition, achieving significant memory savings while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed training framework with operator splitting effectively addresses generalization limitations of neural operators, enables continuous-time predictions, and maintains interpretability while being parameter-efficient.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but struggle to generalise beyond training distributions and are often constrained to a fixed temporal discretisation. This work introduces a physics-informed training framework that addresses these limitations by decomposing PDEs using operator splitting methods, training separate neural operators to learn individual non-linear physical operators while approximating linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions. This modular mixture-of-experts architecture enables generalisation to novel physical regimes by explicitly encoding the underlying operator structure. We formulate the modelling task as a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) where these learned operators constitute the right-hand side, enabling continuous-in-time predictions through standard ODE solvers and implicitly enforcing PDE constraints. Demonstrated on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalising to unseen physics. The method remains parameter-efficient, enabling temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, and provides interpretable components whose behaviour can be verified against known physics.

This paper aims to address general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer and potentially intransitive preferences captured via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices.

Method: The authors adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to model intransitive preferences. They prove that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error using strong convexity and skew-symmetricity. They then propose two algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling with polylogarithmic regret, and (2) Explore-Then-Commit that exploits low-rank structure for statistically efficient regret in high dimensions.

Result: Greedy Sampling achieves $\tilde{O}(ηd^4 (\log T)^2)$ regret (polylogarithmic and $e^{O(η)}$-free). Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{ηr T})$ regret, which is $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free and statistically efficient for high-dimensional online RLHF.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretically sound algorithms for contextual online RLHF with general preferences, achieving improved regret bounds that overcome limitations of prior work and enabling efficient learning in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual online RLHF with general preferences, where the goal is to identify the Nash Equilibrium. We adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to capture potentially intransitive preferences via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices. We investigate general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer (where $η^{-1}$ is the regularization strength), generalizing beyond prior works limited to reverse KL-regularization. Central to our analysis is proving that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error - a result derived solely from strong convexity and the skew-symmetricity of GBPM.Building on this insight and a feature diversity assumption, we establish two regret bounds via two simple algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling achieves polylogarithmic, $e^{O(η)}$-free regret $\tilde{O}(ηd^4 (\log T)^2)$. (2) Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{ηr T})$ by exploiting the low-rank structure; this is the first statistically efficient guarantee for online RLHF in high-dimensions.

TL;DR: Disagreement-based certificates for bounding true risk of any predictors via surrogate models with tight generalization guarantees, without modifying target models or training procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization bounds for deep learning models are typically vacuous, not computable, or restricted to specific model classes. There's a need for practical, computable generalization certificates that work for any predictor without requiring changes to training procedures.

Method: Develop disagreement-based certificates for bounding the gap between true risk of any two predictors. Bound the true risk of the target predictor via a surrogate model with tight generalization guarantees, evaluated on unlabeled data. Use three frameworks for surrogate models: sample compression, model compression, and PAC-Bayes theory.

Conclusion: Provides practical, computable generalization certificates for any deep learning model using disagreement-based approach with surrogate models, overcoming limitations of existing generalization bounds while maintaining flexibility and ease of implementation.

Abstract: Generalization bounds for deep learning models are typically vacuous, not computable or restricted to specific model classes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by providing new disagreement-based certificates for the gap between the true risk of any two predictors. We then bound the true risk of the predictor of interest via a surrogate model that enjoys tight generalization guarantees, and evaluating our disagreement bound on an unlabeled dataset. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of the obtained certificates and showcase the versatility of the approach by training surrogate models leveraging three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression and PAC-Bayes theory. Importantly, such guarantees are achieved without modifying the target model, nor adapting the training procedure to the generalization framework.

*Tyler Bonnet,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyGnROLE is a transformer-based dynamic graph model that uses separate embeddings and positional encodings for source vs. destination nodes, pretrained with a self-supervised Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction objective to improve performance in low-label regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic graph architectures fail to properly handle the asymmetrical behavioral patterns between source and destination nodes in directed graphs, relying on shared parameters without systematic role-aware modeling of their distinct structural and temporal contexts.

Method: The proposed DyGnROLE architecture uses separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings to disentangle source and destination representations. It introduces Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP) as a self-supervised pretraining objective that leverages unlabeled interaction history to learn informative structural biases.

Result: DyGnROLE substantially outperforms diverse state-of-the-art baselines on future edge classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of role-aware modeling for dynamic graph learning.

Conclusion: Role-aware modeling with specialized embeddings and self-supervised pretraining is an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning, particularly beneficial in low-label regimes where annotated data is scarce.

Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.

*Zeno Romero,Kerstin Münnemann,Hans Hasse,Fabian Jirasek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid tensor completion method is developed to predict temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures, combining machine learning with experimental data and active learning strategies to significantly improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matrix completion methods for predicting diffusion coefficients are limited to single-temperature predictions and depend heavily on high-quality experimental data at each specific temperature, creating challenges for comprehensive temperature-dependent modeling.

Method: The paper presents a hybrid tensor completion method using Tucker decomposition, trained on experimental diffusion data at 298K, 313K, and 333K, with SEGWE model predictions as Bayesian prior knowledge. Active learning was used to expand the database with PFG-NMR measurements in 19 solute-solvent systems.

Result: The TCM achieves markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across temperatures 268-378K, with further accuracy improvements through active learning-driven database expansion with new experimental measurements.

Conclusion: Combining data-efficient machine learning methods like tensor completion with adaptive experimentation through active learning represents a promising approach for advancing predictive modeling of transport properties like diffusion coefficients.

Abstract: Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.

*Jonathan Giezendanner,Qidong Yang,Eric Schmitt,Anirban Chandra,Daniel Salles Civitarese,Johannes Jakubik,Jeremy Vila,Detlef Hohl,Campbell Watson,Sherrie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for generating 10-meter resolution near-surface weather fields across the contiguous US by combining coarse atmospheric data with sparse surface stations and high-resolution Earth observations, reducing errors and revealing fine-scale weather patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weather analyses lack meter-scale variability due to land cover and topography, creating uncertainty about whether this fine-scale weather is chaotic or contains predictable components that could be recovered from existing observations.

Method: Conditioning coarse atmospheric state from ERA5 on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data to infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution.

Result: Inferred fields reduced wind error by 29% and temperature/dewpoint error by 6% compared to ERA5, explained more spatial variance, and revealed physically interpretable patterns like urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover.

Conclusion: A substantial component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable, expanding the frontier of weather modeling with a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference that reveals previously unresolved Earth system components.

Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal Web analytics lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics (censoring and non-stationarity) across extended horizons, which slows methodological progress and limits transfer between Web3 and broader Web domains.

Method: Developed a benchmark using 21.8 million transaction records from Aave v3 protocol with 16 survival prediction tasks modeling user behavior transitions, and evaluated domain-aware temporal feature construction versus generic modeling approaches.

Result: Domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches in the FinSurvival Challenge 2025, and the challenge demonstrated that Web3 systems provide high-fidelity sandboxes for studying temporal challenges.

Conclusion: Web3 systems offer valuable temporal benchmarks for studying fundamental Web challenges like churn, risk, and evolution, and should inform next-generation temporal benchmark design to accelerate methodological progress across Web domains.

Abstract: Temporal Web analytics increasingly relies on large-scale, longitudinal data to understand how users, content, and systems evolve over time. A rapidly growing frontier is the \emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.

*Aviral Chawla,Galen Hall,Juniper Lovato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained on multiple Othello variants learn shared board-state representations rather than isolated sub-models, with game-specific specialization emerging in later layers and isomorphisms captured by simple orthogonal rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models handle multiple generative processes, but current mechanistic interpretability studies focus on isolated capabilities, leaving unclear how transformers organize multiple potentially conflicting "world models" in a shared representation space.

Method: Introduces MetaOthello - a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules/tokenizations. Trains small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized. Uses linear probes and interventions to analyze representation sharing across variants.

Result: Transformers do not partition capacity into isolated sub-models; they converge on mostly shared board-state representations that transfer causally across variants. Isomorphic games show equivalent representations up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. For partially overlapping rules: early layers maintain game-agnostic representations, middle layers identify game identity, and later layers specialize.

Conclusion: Transformers organize multiple world models through shared representations with late-layer specialization, rather than isolated sub-models. MetaOthello provides a framework for understanding how foundation models handle multiple generative processes simultaneously.

Abstract: Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, yet mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting "world models". Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize. MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLMs use a two-stage mechanism combining general language pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge to detect exact and approximate protein repeats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein sequences contain repeating segments (both exact and approximate) that are important for structure and function, but understanding how protein language models internally detect these repeats remains unclear.

Method: Investigating PLMs' internal mechanisms by examining how they detect both exact and approximate repeats, characterizing their functional architecture through analysis of positional attention heads and specialized biological components.

Result: PLMs use a mechanism where approximate repeat detection functionally subsumes exact repeat detection, involving two stages: 1) building feature representations using general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, and 2) induction heads attending to aligned tokens across repeated segments.

Conclusion: PLMs solve protein repeat detection by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, establishing a foundation for studying more complex evolutionary processes in these models.

Abstract: Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.

### [182] [Closing the gap on tabular data with Fourier and Implicit Categorical Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23182)
*Marius Dragoi,Florin Gogianu,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning lags behind tree-based methods on tabular data. The paper addresses this gap by using statistical feature processing to identify categorical-like features and Learned Fourier to mitigate neural networks' bias toward smooth solutions, achieving performance comparable to XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning continues to underperform compared to tree-based methods on tabular data, often considered the last "unconquered castle" for neural networks. The authors hypothesize that tree-based methods excel because they can effectively model non-linear interactions from features with categorical characteristics, while neural networks have biases toward uniform numerical processing and smooth solutions that don't align well with tabular data patterns.

Method: The method involves two key components: 1) Statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that show strong correlation with the target once discretized, capturing categorical-like characteristics. 2) Learned Fourier approach to mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, which doesn't align with the inherent properties of tabular data.

Result: The proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts deep learning model performance, enabling them to achieve performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.

Conclusion: By addressing neural networks' biases toward uniform numerical processing and smooth solutions through statistical feature processing and Learned Fourier techniques, deep learning models can achieve competitive performance with tree-based methods on tabular data, potentially conquering this challenging domain for neural networks.

Abstract: While Deep Learning has demonstrated impressive results in applications on various data types, it continues to lag behind tree-based methods when applied to tabular data, often referred to as the last "unconquered castle" for neural networks. We hypothesize that a significant advantage of tree-based methods lies in their intrinsic capability to model and exploit non-linear interactions induced by features with categorical characteristics. In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.

*Ismaël Zighed,Andrea Nóvoa,Luca Magri,Taraneh Sayadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient retraining strategy for parameterized ROMs that matches full retraining accuracy with sparse data, using ensemble methods and focusing only on autoencoder adaptation for out-of-sample regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient adaptation of ROMs to out-of-sample parameter regimes with minimal computational cost and sparse observations, while maintaining accuracy comparable to full retraining.

Method: Encode-process-decode architecture: VAE for dimensionality reduction, transformer network for latent dynamics evolution. Parameterized by external control variables (Reynolds number). Uses ensemble Kalman filtering for data assimilation and trajectory reconstruction from sparse observations.

Result: Proposed strategy achieves accuracy comparable to full retraining with fraction of computational time. Enables ensemble generation and uncertainty quantification. Key finding: dominant error source for out-of-sample forecasts is latent manifold distortion, not latent dynamics changes.

Conclusion: Retraining can be limited to autoencoder only, enabling lightweight, computationally efficient real-time adaptation with sparse fine-tuning data, making the approach practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.

*Quang-Huy Nguyen,Jiaqi Wang,Wei-Shinn Ku*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedWQ-CP is a federated conformal prediction method that addresses dual heterogeneity (data and model) by performing agent-server calibration in one communication round to maintain reliable coverage across agents while minimizing prediction set sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning needs reliable uncertainty quantification to prevent deployment of overconfident models at under-resourced agents. Current approaches address either data or model heterogeneity in isolation, missing their combined effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction's potential in heterogeneous FL settings is underexplored.

Method: FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in one round: each agent computes conformity scores on calibration data, derives local quantile thresholds, then transmits only quantile thresholds and sample sizes to server. Server aggregates thresholds via weighted average to produce global threshold.

Result: Experimental results on seven public datasets for classification and regression show FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing smallest prediction sets/intervals.

Conclusion: FedWQ-CP provides simple yet effective federated conformal prediction that balances coverage performance with efficiency under dual heterogeneity, addressing a critical gap in federated uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ). Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.

### [185] [InnerQ: Hardware-aware Tuning-free Quantization of KV Cache for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23200)
*Sayed Mohammadreza Tayaranian Hosseini,Amir Ardakani,Warren J. Gross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InnerQ is a novel KV cache quantization scheme that groups weights over the inner dimension (instead of outer dimension like previous methods) to align with vector-matrix multiplication hardware patterns, enabling scale factor reuse and reducing memory accesses for faster decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache is a major memory bottleneck in LLM decoding since its size scales with sequence length. Existing quantization methods for KV cache compression don't fully leverage hardware characteristics for optimal performance.

Method: InnerQ uses group-wise quantization along the inner dimension to align dequantization with vector-matrix multiplication operations. It incorporates: 1) hybrid quantization selecting symmetric/asymmetric per group, 2) high-precision windows for recent and attention sink tokens, 3) per-channel normalization of key cache computed during prefill and folded into queries.

Result: InnerQ achieves up to 22% speedup over previous KV cache quantization methods and up to 88% speedup over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication while maintaining GSM8K few-shot performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches.

Conclusion: InnerQ demonstrates that hardware-aware grouping strategy (inner dimension instead of outer dimension) enables efficient KV cache quantization that significantly reduces decode latency without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.

*Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz,Abhay Gupta,Chris Renard,Davis Blalock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOptim reduces training memory usage by over 50% through optimized quantization techniques for master weights and optimizer states, enabling large model training on limited hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard mixed-precision training requires excessive memory per parameter (16+ bytes), making training large models (e.g., 7B parameters) impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.

Method: Two key techniques: 1) Improved master weight splitting with tight quantization error bounds, and 2) Companding functions that reduce error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization, combined with 16-bit gradients.

Result: Reduces AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter (5 bytes with gradient release), cuts checkpoint sizes by over half, with no measurable quality degradation on vision/language benchmarks including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.

Conclusion: FlashOptim enables efficient large-scale model training on memory-constrained hardware while preserving model quality and maintaining API compatibility.

Abstract: Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.
  We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two key techniques. First, we improve master weight splitting by finding and exploiting a tight bound on its quantization error. Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.
  Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural memory system with natural language learning instructions enables selective memory updates from heterogeneous information sources, overcoming limitations of fixed-objective memory in continual learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models struggle in non-stationary environments where continual adaptation is needed. Traditional continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are expensive and fragile, while existing neural memory methods assume fixed objectives and homogeneous information streams, offering users no control over what gets remembered or forgotten over time.

Method: Proposes a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. This enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources.

Result: The approach enables selective learning and memory updates that address limitations of fixed-objective memory systems, particularly in applications like healthcare and customer service where flexible memory management is crucial.

Conclusion: Natural language instructions provide an effective mechanism for controlling neural memory systems, enabling selective learning from diverse information sources and addressing the limitations of existing methods in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are deployed in diverse, non-stationary environments where they must continually adapt to new tasks and evolving knowledge. Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.

Motivation: Current alignment methods require contrastive losses and millions of paired image-text samples. The authors investigate whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision.

Method: Introduces a two-stage framework: 1) Recovers coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher model, 2) Refines alignment on unpaired samples via optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space.

Result: SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learns robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforms supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised alignment approach demonstrates that meaningful multimodal alignment can be achieved with substantially less paired supervision than current methods require, providing a more efficient and practical solution for leveraging pretrained unimodal encoders.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

### [189] [Takeuchi's Information Criteria as Generalization Measures for DNNs Close to NTK Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23219)
*Hiroki Naganuma,Taiji Suzuki,Rio Yokota,Masahiro Nomura,Kohta Ishikawa,Ikuro Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates when Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) can effectively explain generalization gaps in deep neural networks, finding it works well near the neural tangent kernel regime but not outside it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization measures are difficult to establish for deep neural networks due to their complex, statistically singular nature. The research aims to understand when the classical Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) can be reliably used to characterize generalization gaps in DNNs.

Method: The study developed theory indicating TIC's applicability near the neural tangent kernel regime, then conducted extensive experiments training over 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures on 4 datasets. Multiple TIC approximation methods were applied with feasible computational costs to examine the accuracy trade-off.

Result: Estimated TIC values correlate well with generalization gaps under conditions close to the NTK regime, but this correlation disappears outside the NTK regime. Additionally, TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: TIC can effectively explain generalization gaps in deep neural networks when operating near the neural tangent kernel regime, making it a useful tool for hyperparameter optimization with better trial pruning capabilities than existing methods in those conditions.

Abstract: Generalization measures have been studied extensively in the machine learning community to better characterize generalization gaps. However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistically singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult due to their complex nature. This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime. However, we show both theoretically and empirically that outside the NTK regime such correlation disappears. Finally, we demonstrate that TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.

### [190] [Model Agreement via Anchoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23360)
*Eric Eaton,Surbhi Goel,Marcel Hussing,Michael Kearns,Aaron Roth,Sikata Bela Sengupta,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general analysis technique called "anchoring" is developed to bound model disagreement (expected squared difference in predictions between independently trained models), which is applied to prove that four common ML algorithms can drive disagreement to zero with increasing training parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, particularly to drive disagreement to zero using natural training procedure parameters that can be applied to existing methodologies.

Method: Developed a general "anchoring" technique that bounds independent model disagreement by anchoring to the average of two models within the analysis. Applied this technique to analyze four ML algorithms: stacked aggregation, gradient boosting, neural network training with architecture search, and regression tree training with fixed depth.

Result: Proved that all four algorithms can drive model disagreement to zero: (1) stacked aggregation reduces disagreement with increasing number of models k, (2) gradient boosting reduces disagreement with increasing iterations k, (3) neural network training reduces disagreement with increasing architecture size n, and (4) regression trees reduce disagreement with increasing tree depth d.

Conclusion: The anchoring technique provides a general framework for analyzing model disagreement across diverse ML algorithms, demonstrating that several common training methods can achieve consensus through appropriate parameter scaling in strongly convex loss settings.

Abstract: Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.
  We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis. We then apply this technique to prove disagreement bounds for four commonly used machine learning algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation over an arbitrary model class (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of models $k$ being stacked) (2) gradient boosting (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of iterations $k$) (3) neural network training with architecture search (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the size $n$ of the architecture being optimized over) and (4) regression tree training over all regression trees of fixed depth (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the depth $d$ of the tree architecture). For clarity, we work out our initial bounds in the setting of one-dimensional regression with squared error loss -- but then show that all of our results generalize to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a physics-informed regularization for offline goal-conditioned RL using the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to address value estimation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate value estimation in offline GCRL is challenging due to limited coverage of state-action space. Existing physics-informed approaches using PDE constraints can be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments.

Method: Proposes physics-informed regularization derived from viscosity solution of HJB equation, providing physics-based inductive bias grounded in optimal control theory. Uses Feynman-Kac theorem to recast PDE solution as expectation for tractable Monte Carlo estimation.

Result: Method improves geometric consistency and is applicable to navigation and high-dimensional complex manipulation tasks. Demonstrates effectiveness through experiments.

Conclusion: Physics-informed regularization using HJB equation viscosity solution with Feynman-Kac estimation improves value learning in offline goal-conditioned RL, addressing limitations of previous PDE-based approaches in complex environments.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

*Ilya Balabin,Thomas M. Kaiser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-paper series introducing a new mathematical framework combining chemical/biological theory, probability, and causality to address machine learning's causal shortcomings in natural sciences, with Part 1 establishing foundational causal structure and introducing the novel concept of "focus."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in natural sciences are often treated as black boxes without considering the causal structure of datasets, lacking a unified theoretical treatment that incorporates causality into ML modeling of natural phenomena.

Method: Part 1 provides a formal framework of foundational causal structure in chemical biology, extended to machine learning through the novel concept of "focus" (ML's ability to narrow down to hidden mechanisms). Initial proof is demonstrated on a family of Akt inhibitors.

Result: The paper establishes formal framework and introduces "focus" concept, with preliminary validation on Akt inhibitors, setting foundation for subsequent papers on chemical similarity (Part 2) and experimental evidence of hidden causal structures (Part 3).

Conclusion: This series aims to establish "inferential mechanics" - a new mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in chemical biology without reductionism tools, addressing causal flaws in current ML approaches to natural sciences.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques are now routinely encountered in research laboratories across the globe. Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of interest. Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology. This series serves to establish for chemical biology a new kind of mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in Nature without the need for the tools of reductionism: inferential mechanics.

### [193] [A Proper Scoring Rule for Virtual Staining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23305)
*Samuel Tonks,Steve Hood,Ryan Musso,Ceridwen Hopely,Steve Titus,Minh Doan,Iain Styles,Alexander Krull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new evaluation framework called Information Gain (IG) is proposed for assessing generative virtual staining models in high-throughput screening, enabling direct evaluation of predicted posterior distributions rather than just marginal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for generative virtual staining models only assess the accuracy of marginal distributions over datasets, but fail to evaluate the predicted posterior distributions for individual cells, which is crucial for understanding model uncertainty and reliability.

Method: The paper introduces Information Gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule with sound theoretical foundations, allowing for interpretability and comparison across models and features.

Result: When evaluating diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive high-throughput screening dataset using IG and other metrics, IG revealed substantial performance differences that other metrics could not detect, demonstrating its superior discriminative power.

Conclusion: Information Gain provides a theoretically sound and practical evaluation framework for generative virtual staining models, enabling better assessment of predicted posterior distributions and revealing performance differences that conventional metrics miss.

Abstract: Generative virtual staining (VS) models for high-throughput screening (HTS) can provide an estimated posterior distribution of possible biological feature values for each input and cell. However, when evaluating a VS model, the true posterior is unavailable. Existing evaluation protocols only check the accuracy of the marginal distribution over the dataset rather than the predicted posteriors. We introduce information gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule and comes with a sound theoretical motivation allowing for interpretability, and for comparing results across models and features. We evaluate diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG and other metrics and show that IG can reveal substantial performance differences other metrics cannot.

*Camilo Gomez,Pengyang Wang,Liansheng Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss using a constrained optimization framework called Soft-Binary-Argmax that enables gradient-based optimization while preserving performance in large-batch training scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The zero-one loss is considered the gold standard for classification performance but is incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. There's a need for differentiable approximations that can maintain the benefits of the zero-one loss while enabling gradient-based training, particularly to address performance gaps in large-batch training.

Method: The method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, creating a new operator called Soft-Binary-Argmax. The approach derives mathematical properties of this operator and shows how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into both binary and multiclass learning systems.

Result: Empirically, the approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits. This helps narrow the performance gap traditionally observed when training with large batch sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed Soft-Binary-Argmax operator provides a practical differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss that enables better integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, leading to improved performance in large-batch training scenarios through geometric consistency constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have emphasized the integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, enabling richer inductive biases and tighter alignment with task-specific objectives. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss-long considered the gold standard for classification performance, yet incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. Our method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, leading to a new operator we term Soft-Binary-Argmax. After deriving its mathematical properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into binary and multiclass learning systems. Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.

*Alkis Kalavasis,Anay Mehrotra,Manolis Zampetakis,Felix Zhou,Ziyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves two open questions about Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data with convex partitions: establishing conditions for mean identifiability and providing computationally efficient estimation algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse data with partial information (sets containing samples rather than exact values) arises naturally in applications like measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and economic systems, motivating the study of statistical estimation from such data.

Method: The paper studies Gaussian mean estimation where true samples are drawn from a d-dimensional Gaussian with identity covariance, but only revealed through sets in a partition containing them. It focuses on convex partitions.

Result: Resolves two key open questions: (1) characterizes when the mean is identifiable under convex partitions, and (2) provides computationally efficient estimation algorithms under identifiability and convex partitions.

Conclusion: The work establishes fundamental conditions for identifiability and computational tractability in Gaussian mean estimation from coarse convex partitions, filling important gaps in the theory of coarse data analysis.

Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]

*Elad Kimchi Shoshani,Leeyam Gabay,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLADA eliminates pixel transmission by using only class labels from a preloaded reference dataset, achieving <1MB payloads for task distribution while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset distribution faces massive communication costs when transmitting large payloads to diverse clients. Dataset distillation methods struggle with high-resolution data and don't achieve sufficiently small file sizes. There's a need for a method that eliminates pixel transmission entirely.

Method: PLADA assumes agents have a preloaded large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (like ImageNet). Instead of transmitting pixels, only class labels for specific images are sent. A pruning mechanism filters the reference dataset to retain only labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task, addressing distribution mismatch between reference and target datasets.

Result: Experiments on 10 diverse datasets show PLADA can transfer task knowledge with payloads less than 1 MB while maintaining high classification accuracy. The approach successfully achieves efficient dataset serving without pixel transmission.

Conclusion: PLADA offers a promising solution for efficient dataset serving by completely eliminating pixel transmission through a label-only approach with smart reference dataset pruning, enabling task distribution with minimal communication overhead.

Abstract: A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: FORGE: A physics-grounded multi-agent simulator + Neural-Linear UCB allocator that resolves four-way tension in crowdsourcing between quality, sustainability, feasibility, and strategic behavior by treating contractors as rational agents with fatigue states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crowdsourcing platforms face a four-way tension between allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behavior (Cold-Start, Burnout, Utilisation, Strategic Agency Dilemma). Existing methods only resolve at most two tensions simultaneously.

Method: FORGE: A physics-grounded K+1 multi-agent simulator where each contractor is a rational agent declaring load-acceptance threshold based on fatigue state. Neural-Linear UCB allocator fuses Two-Tower embedding network with Physics-Informed Covariance Prior from offline simulator interactions.

Result: Over T=200 cold-start episodes, achieves highest reward of all non-oracle methods (LRew = 0.555 ± 0.041) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation. Maintains robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to σ=0.20.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses all four tensions in crowdsourcing simultaneously, achieving high quality with low utilisation while being robust to workforce changes and noise, which no conventional baseline achieves.

Abstract: Crowdsourcing platforms face a four-way tension between allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behaviour--a dilemma we formalise as the Cold-Start, Burnout, Utilisation, and Strategic Agency Dilemma. Existing methods resolve at most two of these tensions simultaneously: greedy heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods achieve Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout, while bandit algorithms eliminate burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% workforce utilisation.To address this, we introduce FORGE, a physics-grounded $K+1$ multi-agent simulator in which each contractor is a rational agent that declares its own load-acceptance threshold based on its fatigue state, converting the standard passive Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) into a genuine Stackelberg game. Operating within FORGE, we propose a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that fuses a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior derived from offline simulator interactions. The prior simultaneously warm-starts skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration landscape, providing a geometry-aware belief state from episode 1 that measurably reduces cold-start regret.Over $T = 200$ cold-start episodes, the proposed method achieves the highest reward of all non-oracle methods ($\text{LRew} = 0.555 \pm 0.041$) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation--a combination no conventional baseline achieves--while maintaining robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to $σ= 0.20$.

*Yuanjun Li,Bin Zhang,Hao Chen,Zhouyang Jiang,Dapeng Li,Zhiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: QSIM: A similarity-weighted Q-learning framework for cooperative multi-agent RL that mitigates Q-value overestimation by reconstructing TD targets using action similarity instead of the max operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value decomposition (VD) methods in cooperative MARL suffer from systematic Q-value overestimation due to their reliance on the max operator for TD target calculation. This issue is exacerbated by the combinatorial explosion of joint action spaces, leading to unstable learning and suboptimal policies.

Method: QSIM reconstructs TD targets using action similarity by forming a similarity-weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, it integrates Q-values from behaviorally related actions while weighting them by their similarity to the greedy choice.

Result: Extensive experiments show QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to original algorithms. Empirical analysis confirms QSIM significantly mitigates systematic value overestimation in MARL.

Conclusion: QSIM effectively addresses the overestimation problem in cooperative MARL by smoothing TD targets with structurally relevant alternatives through similarity weighting, improving learning stability and policy quality across different VD methods.

Abstract: Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim.

Abstract: Smartphones represent a uniquely challenging environment for agentic systems. Unlike cloud or desktop settings, mobile devices combine constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states.
