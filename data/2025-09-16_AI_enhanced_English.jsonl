We focus on three key\nissues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for\nexample, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains\n$\\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split\nrandomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we\nfind to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if\nused uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the\nstructural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these\noft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions\nof the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and\nsplit by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but\nwith different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset\nwhich ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more\nsensible standard for benchmarking model performance.
