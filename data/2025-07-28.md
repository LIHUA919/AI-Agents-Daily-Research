### [1] [Initial Steps in Integrating Large Reasoning and Action Models for Service Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18775)
*Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs) to automate service composition, combining reasoning and execution capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Service composition is challenging due to limited reasoning or brittle execution. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging LRMs for reasoning and LAMs for execution.

Method: The authors propose an integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework to combine the strengths of both paradigms.

Result: The integration enables automated service composition by reasoning about requirements and dynamically executing workflows.

Conclusion: The LRM-LAM framework has the potential to transform service composition into a fully automated, user-friendly process driven by natural language intent.

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

### [2] [Simulation-Driven Reinforcement Learning in Queuing Network Routing Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18795)
*Fatima Al-Ani,Molly Wang,Jevon Charles,Aaron Ong,Joshua Forday,Vinayak Modi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simulation-driven RL framework (Dyna-DDPG) is developed for optimizing routing in complex queueing networks, outperforming traditional methods in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional queueing methods fail in dynamic, uncertain environments, necessitating a robust RL approach for better routing decisions in manufacturing and communication systems.

Method: Proposes Dyna-DDPG, combining DDPG with Dyna-style planning, using separate predictive models for next-state transitions and rewards. Includes a flexible simulation environment for diverse scenarios.

Result: The framework learns effective routing policies quickly, maintains robust performance under disruptions, and scales well to larger networks.

Conclusion: The Dyna-DDPG framework is a practical, reproducible solution for real-world queueing network optimization, with strong performance and scalability.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [3] [A Neuroscience-Inspired Dual-Process Model of Compositional Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18868)
*Alex Noviello,Claas Beger,Jacob Groner,Kevin Ellis,Weinan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE, a brain-inspired AI framework, achieves systematic compositional generalization by combining a meta-trained Transformer and a Schema Engine, mimicking human hippocampal-prefrontal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of systematic compositional generalization in AI by drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes involving the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

Method: MIRAGE integrates two modules: (1) a meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer for iterative decomposition and (2) a Schema Engine for dynamic schema extraction and application.

Result: Achieves >99% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark with 1.19M parameters, demonstrating systematic generalization.

Conclusion: MIRAGE's success hinges on schema quality and iterative refinement, validating its brain-inspired approach.

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

### [4] [Success in Humanoid Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18883)
*Wuhao Wang,Zhiyong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First successful reinforcement learning of humanoid locomotion under partial observability, achieving performance comparable to full-state methods using a novel history encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of effective policy learning in high-dimensional, partially observable tasks like humanoid locomotion, where prior methods failed.

Method: Introduces a novel history encoder that processes past observations in parallel, integrated into a model-free algorithm.

Result: Learned policy matches state-of-the-art performance with only partial state access and adapts to robot property variations.

Conclusion: The history encoder successfully reconstructs contextual information, enabling robust decision-making in partially observable environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

### [5] [Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18977)
*Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri,Ryan A. Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Kanak Mahadik,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Mohammad Rostami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an incremental training framework for Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to handle unseen or sparsely connected entities, combining a model-agnostic enhancement layer and weighted sampling. It outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in link prediction and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TKG completion models assume full graph access during training, ignoring challenges like evolving knowledge and sparse connections for new entities. This work aims to address these gaps.

Method: Proposes an incremental training framework with a model-agnostic enhancement layer (using global entity similarity) and weighted sampling (emphasizing edges of rare entities).

Result: Outperforms existing methods, achieving 10% and 15% MRR improvements on benchmark datasets, excelling in link prediction and handling long-tail entities.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances TKG completion robustness, especially in incremental settings.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

### [6] [Integrating LLM in Agent-Based Social Simulation: Opportunities and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19364)
*Patrick Taillandier,Jean Daniel Zucker,Arnaud Grignard,Benoit Gaudou,Nghi Quang Huynh,Alexis Drogoul*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of LLMs in social simulation, discussing their potential and limitations, and suggests hybrid approaches for better integration with traditional agent-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the role of LLMs in social simulation, highlighting their capabilities and challenges from a computational social science perspective.

Method: Reviews LLMs' cognitive replication abilities and surveys applications in multi-agent simulations, focusing on architectures, scale, and validation.

Result: Identifies strengths (e.g., interactive simulations) and weaknesses (e.g., explanatory modeling) of LLMs, advocating for hybrid solutions.

Conclusion: Recommends integrating LLMs with rule-based systems to balance flexibility and transparency in social simulations.

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

### [7] [Fine-Grained Traffic Inference from Road to Lane via Spatio-Temporal Graph Node Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19089)
*Shuhao Li,Weidong Yang,Yue Cui,Xiaoxing Liu,Lingkai Meng,Lipeng Ma,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task to generate detailed lane-level traffic data using limited inputs, proposing a two-stage framework called RoadDiff for accurate inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining lane-level traffic data is challenging due to sensor limitations and tracking inaccuracies, hindering data-driven models for applications like autonomous driving and traffic management.

Method: The RoadDiff framework uses a Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and a Lane Diffusion Module to exploit spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships in road data.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets validated RoadDiff's effectiveness in addressing the FRTI task.

Conclusion: RoadDiff provides an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for fine-grained traffic management, with datasets and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

### [8] [Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109)
*Noé Lallouet,Tristan Cazenave,Cyrille Enderli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pareto-NRPA extends NRPA for multi-objective optimization, maintaining non-dominated fronts and adapting policies for diversity. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on constrained problems like MO-TSPTW and neural architecture search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize NRPA, a single-objective algorithm, for multi-objective optimization, addressing the need for efficient methods in discrete search spaces.

Method: Pareto-NRPA uses nested search and policy updates, maintaining non-dominated fronts and adapting policies based on Pareto front diversity.

Result: Competitive performance in convergence and diversity, outperforming evolutionary algorithms on constrained problems.

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA is the first NRPA adaptation for multi-objective optimization, showing strong potential for complex problems.

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

### [9] [OS-MAP: How Far Can Computer-Using Agents Go in Breadth and Depth?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19132)
*Xuetian Chen,Yinghao Chen,Xinfeng Yuan,Zhuo Peng,Lu Chen,Yuekeng Li,Zhoujia Zhang,Yingqian Huang,Leyan Huang,Jiaqing Liang,Tianbao Xie,Zhiyong Wu,Qiushi Sun,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OS-MAP is a benchmark for daily computer-using automation, organizing 416 tasks across 15 applications to evaluate agent capabilities and alignment with real-world demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack consideration for task heterogeneity, agent capabilities, and alignment with user demands, hindering practical deployment.

Method: OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation level (five-level taxonomy) and generalization scope (demand hierarchy).

Result: State-of-the-art agents struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination.

Conclusion: OS-MAP provides a structured framework to assess agent capabilities, highlighting gaps and guiding future research in computer-using agents.

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,
environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at

*Jiyao Wang,Xiao Yang,Qingyong Hu,Jiankai Tang,Can Liu,Dengbo He,Yuntao Wang,Yingcong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysDrive is a large-scale multimodal dataset for in-vehicle physiological monitoring, addressing limitations of existing datasets by including diverse modalities, driving conditions, and synchronized ground truths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for remote physiological measurement (RPM) in driving scenarios are limited in scale, diversity, and real-world applicability, hindering progress in driver monitoring.

Method: PhysDrive collects synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and mmWave radar data from 48 drivers, along with six physiological ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR, SpO2), covering diverse driving conditions.

Result: The dataset enables comprehensive benchmarking of signal-processing and deep-learning methods, with open-source code for mainstream toolboxes.

Conclusion: PhysDrive is a foundational resource expected to advance research in multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit systems.

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

### [11] [Faster Lifting for Ordered Domains with Predecessor Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19182)
*Kuncheng Zou,Jiahao Mai,Yonggang Zhang,Yuyi Wang,Ondřej Kuželka,Yuanhong Wang,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor relations, offering exponential speedups for immediate and second predecessor relations and handling general k-th predecessors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC) struggle with practical applications involving predecessor relations, despite theoretical tractability.

Method: The proposed algorithm treats predecessor relations as native to the axiom, avoiding the need to encode them via linear order predicates.

Result: The algorithm achieves significant speedups (up to an order of magnitude) in experiments on lifted inference tasks and combinatorics problems.

Conclusion: The new approach efficiently handles predecessor relations, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

### [12] [Knowledge Grafting: A Mechanism for Optimizing AI Model Deployment in Resource-Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19261)
*Osama Almurshed,Ashish Kaushal,Asmail Muftah,Nitin Auluck,Omer Rana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces knowledge grafting, a method to optimize large AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring features from a donor model to a smaller one, reducing size by 88.54% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments by reducing model size without sacrificing performance.

Method: Knowledge grafting transfers selected features (scion) from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model.

Result: The rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs. donor's 87.47%), lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and 90.45% accuracy on unseen test data, with an 88.54% size reduction.

Conclusion: Knowledge grafting enables efficient AI deployment in resource-constrained settings, overcoming the size-performance trade-off, and is applicable across edge computing scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

### [13] [Modeling Uncertainty: Constraint-Based Belief States in Imperfect-Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19263)
*Achille Morenville,Éric Piette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares constraint-based and probabilistic belief representations in imperfect-information games, finding minimal performance differences between the two.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify decision-making in imperfect-information games by delegating state estimation to the game model, reducing the need for game-specific inference logic.

Method: Two belief representation approaches: constraint-based (using Constraint Satisfaction Problems) and probabilistic (using Belief Propagation). Evaluated with general-purpose agents in two games.

Result: Constraint-based beliefs performed comparably to probabilistic inference, with minimal differences in agent performance.

Conclusion: Constraint-based belief states may suffice for effective decision-making in many imperfect-information game settings.

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building neural systems that generalize well for symbolic algorithms, especially out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: Introduces a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by rewriting algorithms, with modular implementations (NRS and FastNRS). Evaluated on mathematical formula simplification and multi-domain learning.

Result: FastNRS improves memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. Outperforms Neural Data Router, GPT-4o, and matches OpenAI's o1-preview model.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong generalization and efficiency, advancing neuro-symbolic learning for algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

*Amir Fard,Arnold X. -X. Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning method for multi-year infrastructure planning, addressing scalability issues with combinatorial action spaces and budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with scalability due to complex action spaces, asset deterioration, and budget constraints in infrastructure planning.

Method: Decomposes the problem into high-level Budget Planner and low-level Maintenance Planner, integrating linear programming with hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic.

Result: Outperforms Deep Q-Learning and genetic algorithms in convergence speed, scalability, and near-optimal solutions for sewer networks.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently handles large-scale infrastructure planning with rigorous budget compliance and scalability.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and

### [16] [Diffusion Models for Solving Inverse Problems via Posterior Sampling with Piecewise Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18654)
*Saeed Mohseni-Sehdeh,Walid Saad,Kei Sakaguchi,Tao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework for solving inverse problems using piecewise guidance, balancing efficiency and accuracy without task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a problem-agnostic method for solving inverse problems efficiently while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Introduces a piecewise guidance scheme in diffusion models, adapting approximations for high-noise and low-noise phases.

Result: Achieves significant inference time reductions (23-25%) for image inpainting and super-resolution with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, adaptable, and computationally efficient for various inverse problems.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

*Donghee Han,Daehee Kim,Minjun Lee,Daeyoung Roh,Keejun Han,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGAKT is a graph neural network model for knowledge tracing that improves computational efficiency by focusing on relevant subgraphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge tracing methods struggle with high computational costs when handling large graphs and long sequences.

Method: DGAKT uses a dual graph attention mechanism to process subgraphs of student-exercise-KC relationships, reducing memory and computational demands.

Result: DGAKT outperforms existing KT models and achieves superior resource efficiency.

Conclusion: DGAKT addresses a critical gap in KT by balancing performance and computational efficiency, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Innovator upcycles a dense LLM into a Mixtures-of-Experts model to avoid catastrophic forgetting, improving science tasks by 25% while retaining general task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent degradation of general abilities when pretraining LLMs on science data, Innovator decouples domain knowledge.

Method: Four-stage training: Scientific Expert Induction, Fine-grained Expert Splitting, Science-Aware Routing warmup, and Generalist-Scientist Integration.

Result: 25% average improvement in 30 scientific tasks, 70% win rate, and 99% retention in general tasks. Reasoning post-training boosts performance by 30%.

Conclusion: Innovator effectively balances scientific and general knowledge, enhancing performance without forgetting.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

### [19] [Market Making Strategies with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18680)
*Óscar Fernández Vicente*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to market making, addressing challenges like inventory risk and non-stationary markets. It introduces novel methods like POW-dTS and demonstrates superior performance over traditional strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market makers face challenges like inventory risk and dynamic markets. RL offers potential for adaptive, profitable strategies.

Method: Formulates market making as an RL problem, uses reward engineering and MORL for inventory management, and introduces POW-dTS for non-stationarity.

Result: RL-based approaches outperform traditional strategies in simulations.

Conclusion: The study advances methodologies for adaptive market making, highlighting RL's transformative potential in algorithmic trading.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

### [20] [Concept Probing: Where to Find Human-Defined Concepts (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18681)
*Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro,Afonso Leote,João Leite*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to automatically identify the best neural network layer for concept probing based on representation informativeness and regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve concept probing by determining the optimal layer for probing human-defined concepts, as probe performance depends on the layer's representations.

Method: Proposes an automated approach to select the most informative and regular layer for probing a given concept.

Result: Validated through extensive empirical analysis across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies suitable layers for concept probing, enhancing probing accuracy.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

### [21] [The Right to be Forgotten in Pruning: Unveil Machine Unlearning on Sparse Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18725)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Jie Ji,Ruimeng Ye,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "un-pruning" to address the impact of deleted data on sparse models, proposing an algorithm to approximate the pruned topology and integrating it with existing unlearning methods. It also critiques MIA for assessing unlearning and introduces new metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The right to be forgotten in machine learning and the unexplored impact of deleted data on sparse models motivated the study.

Method: Proposes an un-pruning algorithm to approximate pruned topology driven by retained data, compatible with existing unlearning methods. Theoretical bounds on error are provided.

Result: The algorithm works for both structured and unstructured sparse models. MIA is found unreliable for unlearning assessment, leading to new metrics.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of un-pruning, and the method is adaptable to various pruning and unlearning techniques.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

### [22] [Exploitation Over Exploration: Unmasking the Bias in Linear Bandit Recommender Offline Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18756)
*Pedro R. Pires,Gregorio F. Azevedo,Pietro L. Campos,Rafael T. Sereicikas,Tiago A. Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Greedy linear models without exploration outperform exploratory MABs in offline evaluations, highlighting flaws in current assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of exploration strategies in contextual linear bandits and identify limitations in offline evaluation protocols.

Method: Extensive offline empirical comparison of several linear MABs, including greedy models, across various datasets.

Result: Greedy models (no exploration) consistently perform best in over 90% of datasets, outperforming exploratory variants.

Conclusion: Offline evaluation inadequately assesses exploration efficacy, necessitating more robust methodologies for interactive learning in recommender systems.

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

### [23] [Learning Individual Intrinsic Reward in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Incorporating Generalized Human Expertise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18867)
*Xuefei Wu,Xiao Yin,Yuanyang Zhu,Chunlin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIGHT is a novel MARL framework that integrates human expertise to craft individual intrinsic rewards, improving exploration and performance in sparse-reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficient exploration in MARL with team rewards, especially in sparse-reward settings, by leveraging human knowledge.

Method: Combines dense individual rewards and human expertise, using action distribution and human preference to design intrinsic rewards via Q-learning.

Result: Outperforms baselines in performance and knowledge reusability across sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: LIGHT effectively integrates human expertise into MARL, enhancing exploration and generalization.

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

### [24] [CLEAR: Unlearning Spurious Style-Content Associations with Contrastive LEarning with Anti-contrastive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18794)
*Minghui Sun,Benjamin A. Goldstein,Matthew M. Engelhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEAR is a framework to separate task-relevant and task-irrelevant features in data representations, improving performance when superficial characteristics shift at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure equitable and generalizable predictions in applications like healthcare by learning features unaffected by superficial attributes (e.g., race, sex).

Method: Proposes CLEAR, which uses Pair-Switching (PS) to minimize mutual information between style (task-irrelevant) and content (task-relevant) features, implemented in a VAE.

Result: CLEAR-VAE enables style-content swapping/interpolation and improves classification performance with unseen content-style combinations.

Conclusion: CLEAR effectively separates essential and superficial features, enhancing generalizability and fairness in predictions.

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Wencheng Zou,Nan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes GNN robustness against hardware-induced bit-flip errors and introduces Ralts, a lightweight solution to enhance resilience by filtering outliers and recovering graph topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are used in safety-critical applications, but hardware-induced faults (e.g., bit flips) are underexplored, posing risks to reliability.

Method: Ralts leverages graph similarity metrics to detect and recover from bit-flip errors, integrating protective techniques into GNN aggregation functions.

Result: Ralts improves GNN accuracy by 20% for weight/embedding errors and 10% for adjacency matrix errors, maintaining efficiency comparable to standard functions.

Conclusion: Ralts offers a scalable and efficient solution to bolster GNN robustness against hardware faults, with broad applicability across models and datasets.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

### [26] [Fishers for Free? Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18807)
*YuXin Li,Felix Dangel,Derek Tam,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Squisher," a method to approximate the Fisher diagonal by reusing Adam's squared gradient accumulator, saving computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Fisher diagonal is computationally expensive to estimate, while adaptive methods like Adam already compute similar squared gradients. The paper explores whether this can be leveraged for a free approximation.

Method: The "Squisher" reuses Adam's squared gradient accumulator to approximate the Fisher diagonal. Experiments compare it to the Fisher diagonal and baselines across five applications.

Result: Squisher performs similarly to the Fisher diagonal and outperforms baselines. The paper also quantifies the differences between Squisher and the Fisher diagonal.

Conclusion: Squisher provides a computationally efficient and effective approximation of the Fisher diagonal by leveraging existing gradient computations.

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

*Marco Bagatella,Mert Albaba,Jonas Hübotter,Georg Martius,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time training method for offline reinforcement learning, improving policy performance by fine-tuning on relevant data for the current goal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance offline reinforcement learning by leveraging test-time training, similar to foundation models, for better adaptation to specific goals.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised data selection criterion and a goal-conditioned test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm for fine-tuning policies on relevant offline data.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance gains in high-dimensional tasks compared to standard offline pre-training, even with minimal compute costs.

Conclusion: GC-TTT outperforms scaling model size at comparable costs, showing its effectiveness for adaptive policy improvement.

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow matching (FM) model for fast simulations in high-energy physics, achieving high fidelity and reduced computational costs for ALICE experiment detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address increasing computational demands in high-energy physics by leveraging generative neural networks for efficient simulations.

Method: Develops surrogate models using FM with a low-parameter training strategy for zero degree calorimeters in ALICE.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity (Wasserstein distance 1.27 for ZN, 1.30 for ZP) and faster inference times (0.46 ms for ZN, 0.026 ms for latent FM).

Conclusion: The FM model offers a computationally efficient solution for high-energy physics simulations, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scale-informed neural operator is proposed to generalize ML models for solving PDEs across varying scales, leveraging scale-consistency properties and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of ML models for PDEs, which fail to generalize outside training data (e.g., fixed Reynolds numbers or domains).

Method: Uses scale-consistency properties of PDEs to design a scale-informed neural operator with a scale-consistency loss, enabling training across multiple scales.

Result: The model generalizes to Reynolds numbers from 250 to 10000 (trained on 1000) and reduces errors by 34% on average across datasets.

Conclusion: Scale-consistency loss and scale-informed neural operators enhance generalization and accuracy for solving PDEs across diverse scales.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

*Ruimeng Ye,Zihan Wang,Xiao Yang,Zinan Ling,Manling Li,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) to complex interactive decision-making by fine-tuning strong models with weak model-generated trajectories, including failures, and introduces trajectory trees with MCTS for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance W2SG beyond simple tasks by leveraging weak model trajectories, including failures, inspired by human learning.

Method: Fine-tunes strong models with weak model trajectories, constructs hierarchical trajectory trees, and uses MCTS for optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved reasoning and decision-making across diverse tasks, with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, robust, and effective for W2SG in complex environments.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

### [31] [Early Mortality Prediction in ICU Patients with Hypertensive Kidney Disease Using Interpretable Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18866)
*Yong Si,Junyi Fan,Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Minoo Ahmadi,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Greg Placencia,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model (CatBoost) was developed to predict 30-day mortality in ICU patients with hypertensive kidney disease, achieving high accuracy (AUROC 0.88) and interpretability using SHAP and ALE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypertensive kidney disease patients in ICUs lack tailored risk prediction tools, necessitating early identification of high-risk individuals for better clinical decisions.

Method: A machine learning framework using early clinical data from MIMIC-IV v2.2 was developed. Features were selected via random forest and mutual information, with CatBoost performing best in cross-validation.

Result: CatBoost achieved an AUROC of 0.88, with sensitivity 0.811 and specificity 0.798. SHAP and ALE highlighted key predictors like altered consciousness and vasopressor use.

Conclusion: The interpretable pipeline supports real-time risk assessment and individualized triage, showing promise for clinical deployment pending external validation.

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

*Trung Nguyen,Md Masud Rana,Farjana Tasnim Mukta,Chang-Guo Zhan,Duc Duy Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMC-MPNN, a novel GNN framework, improves BBBP prediction by incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate BBBP prediction is crucial for CNS drug development, but current GNNs often ignore 3D geometric information vital for transport mechanisms.

Method: Introduces GMC-MPNN, which enhances message-passing architectures with atomic-level geometry and weighted colored subgraphs to capture spatial and chemical context.

Result: GMC-MPNN achieves superior performance (AUC-ROC up to 0.9704, RMSE 0.4609) in classification and regression tasks, validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GMC-MPNN sets a new benchmark by integrating spatial geometry, offering a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

### [33] [Secure Best Arm Identification in the Presence of a Copycat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18975)
*Asaf Cohen,Onur Günlü*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses best arm identification in stochastic linear bandits with a security constraint, proposing a secure algorithm using coded arms to hide the best arm from an observer while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem arises when a player aims to identify the best arm in a bandit setup while preventing an observer (copycat Chloe) from learning the best arm. Existing methods either reveal the best arm or perform poorly.

Method: The authors introduce a secure algorithm that uses coded arms, avoiding cryptographic primitives or keys, to balance performance and secrecy.

Result: The algorithm achieves an error exponent of Ω(T/log²(d)), outperforming naive secure methods (Ω(T/d)) while hiding the best arm.

Conclusion: The proposed secure algorithm effectively balances identification accuracy and security, offering a practical solution for scenarios requiring secrecy.

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

*Vidhi Oad,Param Pathak,Nouhaila Innan,Shalini D,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KASPER introduces a regime-aware, interpretable framework for financial forecasting, outperforming traditional models with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold networks and symbolic rule extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning models struggle with nonlinear, regime-dependent financial markets, necessitating adaptive and interpretable solutions.

Method: KASPER integrates regime detection (Gumbel-Softmax), sparse spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, and symbolic rule extraction (Monte Carlo Shapley values).

Result: Achieves R²=0.89, Sharpe Ratio=12.02, MSE=0.0001 on Yahoo Finance data, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: Sets a new standard for regime-aware, transparent, and robust financial forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

*HMNS Kumari,HMLS Kumari,UMMPK Nawarathne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework for classifying DTC recurrence using ML and Bayesian Neural Networks, achieving high accuracy and addressing uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTC recurrence is a public health concern, requiring accurate, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware predictive models.

Method: Used 11 ML models and Bayesian Neural Networks with varying priors on datasets with and without feature selection.

Result: SVM achieved 0.9481 accuracy initially; after feature selection, LR reached 0.9611. BNN with Normal 0,10 prior showed highest accuracies (0.9740 and 0.9870).

Conclusion: BNN models, especially with Normal 0,10 prior, outperform traditional ML in accuracy and uncertainty awareness for DTC recurrence prediction.

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

*Maxence Bouvier,Ryan Amaudruz,Felix Arnold,Renzo Andri,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GENIAL is a Transformer-based framework for optimizing arithmetic units like multipliers, using ML to minimize power and area, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI workloads demand optimized arithmetic units, but manual or heuristic-based methods are inefficient in exploring the design space.

Method: GENIAL uses a two-stage Transformer model (self-supervised pretraining + supervised finetuning) to predict hardware metrics and optimize operand encodings.

Result: GENIAL achieves up to 18% switching activity savings in multipliers and shows versatility in improving Finite State Machines.

Conclusion: GENIAL advances automated, quality-optimized circuit generation for digital systems.

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

*Jongsoo Lee,Jangwon Kim,Jiseok Jeong,Soohee Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust agent (conservative agent) is proposed to handle random delays in RL by transforming them into constant delays, enabling existing methods to work without modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL applications face challenges due to random delays, which violate Markov assumptions and lack exploration compared to constant delays.

Method: The conservative agent reformulates random-delay environments into constant-delay equivalents, allowing direct use of existing constant-delay methods.

Result: The agent outperforms baselines in continuous control tasks, showing better asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The conservative agent effectively addresses random delays in RL, extending the applicability of existing methods without performance loss.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FADE is a lightweight framework for robust learning under sequential covariate shift (SCS), using Fisher-based adaptation and shift-aware regularization. It outperforms existing methods and works well in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of sequential covariate shift (SCS) in dynamic environments where input distributions evolve over time.

Method: Uses Fisher information geometry for shift-aware regularization and a Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal to detect distribution changes. Operates online with fixed memory and no target labels.

Result: Achieves up to 19% higher accuracy under severe shifts compared to methods like TENT and DIW. Generalizes to federated learning.

Conclusion: FADE is robust, scalable, and theoretically grounded, with bounded regret and parameter consistency.

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based generative framework for financial time series incorporates GBM into the noising process, reflecting heteroskedasticity. It balances drift and diffusion, aligning with score-based models, and uses a Transformer-based architecture for training. Empirical results show realistic reproduction of financial stylized facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard score-based models in handling financial time series by incorporating GBM and reflecting heteroskedasticity.

Method: Proposes a forward noising process with GBM, balancing drift and diffusion terms, and trains the reverse-time process via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the model reproduces stylized facts like heavy-tailed returns, volatility clustering, and leverage effect more realistically than conventional models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively models financial time series by integrating GBM and achieves realistic results, outperforming standard diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

TL;DR: MindSpeed RL is a scalable and efficient system for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, addressing poor cluster scalability and low memory utilization by optimizing data dependencies and integrating parallelization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL training systems suffer from poor scalability and memory inefficiency due to heavy cross-node dependencies.

Method: MindSpeed RL introduces a distributed transfer dock strategy for sample flow and an allgather-swap strategy for resharding flow, along with parallelization and acceleration techniques.

Result: Experiments show MindSpeed RL increases throughput by 1.42 ~ 3.97 times compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL is a high-performance, scalable solution for RL training, demonstrated on Ascend NPUs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProGMLP introduces a progressive framework for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation, enabling flexible trade-offs between cost and accuracy with sequential training and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing G2M methods lack dynamic adjustment of inference cost and accuracy, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: ProGMLP uses Progressive Training Structure (PTS), Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD), and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) for sequential training and refinement.

Result: Validated on eight datasets, ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while adapting to runtime variations.

Conclusion: ProGMLP is effective for diverse applications by dynamically balancing cost and accuracy.

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

*Eva van Tegelen,George van Voorn,Ioannis Athanasiadis,Peter van Heijster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural ODEs effectively learn and forecast bifurcations in dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods by using Neural ODEs to learn bifurcation structures from data.

Method: Apply Neural ODEs to a predator-prey system with local and global bifurcations, learning parameter-dependent vector fields.

Result: Neural ODEs recover bifurcation structures and forecast beyond training parameter regions, with performance tied to data quality over quantity.

Conclusion: Neural ODEs offer a robust, data-driven approach for forecasting bifurcations in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DyRC-VG, a dynamics-informed reservoir computing method using visibility graphs for better time series prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random reservoir networks in RC often lead to suboptimal performance; DyRC-VG aims to improve this by inferring structure from data.

Method: Uses visibility graphs to convert time series into networks, constructing the reservoir directly from training data.

Result: DyRC-VG outperforms random Erdős-Rényi graphs in prediction accuracy and consistency for nonlinear tasks like the Duffing oscillator.

Conclusion: DyRC-VG offers a parameter-free, data-driven approach to reservoir computing, enhancing prediction quality and reliability.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Molecular assembly is proposed as an agnostic biosignature for life detection, measurable via mass spectrometry without structural elucidation, and improved by machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect extraterrestrial life without bias from terrestrial assumptions, using mass spectrometry data.

Method: Developed a machine learning model to predict molecular assembly from mass spectrometry data, addressing mission constraints.

Result: The model reduced prediction error by three-fold, though instrumental inconsistencies can double errors, highlighting the need for standardization.

Conclusion: Standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular assembly prediction, supporting future astrobiology missions.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in privacy preservation at the data publishing stage under regulations like GDPR, where existing PPDP methods struggle to balance privacy and utility.

Method: Leverages Gaussian DP with a structured noise-injection mechanism for unbiased graph structure recovery, extending to discrete-variable graphs.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance in graph learning, providing theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: Offers a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph analysis, addressing limitations of traditional DP methods.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

### [46] [Clustering-Oriented Generative Attribute Graph Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19085)
*Mulin Chen,Bocheng Wang,Jiaxin Zhong,Zongcheng Miao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGIR introduces a unified framework for attribute-missing graph clustering by combining generative imputation and edge-aware refinement, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imputation methods lack class-relevant semantics, and refinement strategies ignore uncorrelated attributes, leading to sub-optimal clustering.

Method: CGIR estimates subcluster distributions for precise imputation, uses generative adversarial sampling, and merges subclusters to guide an edge attention network for refinement.

Result: CGIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attribute-missing graph clustering.

Conclusion: CGIR effectively integrates imputation and refinement, improving clustering accuracy by addressing semantic and attribute redundancy issues.

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PVAL framework leverages LLMs for accurate solar PV panel detection in satellite imagery, addressing transparency, scalability, and adaptability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack transparency, require large datasets, and struggle with generalization, hindering large-scale deployment of solar PV detection.

Method: PVAL uses task decomposition, output standardization, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning with curated datasets to improve LLM performance.

Result: PVAL provides a transparent, scalable, and adaptable solution for solar panel detection, enabling large-scale renewable energy integration.

Conclusion: PVAL offers an automated, reproducible pipeline for solar PV detection, supporting optimized grid management and renewable energy systems.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attributed graph clustering is challenging due to graph complexity and node attribute heterogeneity, requiring better methods to capture dependencies and structures.

Method: GCL-GCN combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships in a Graphormer module and uses contrastive learning to enhance feature representations.

Result: GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced methods, improving ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97% on the Cora dataset.

Conclusion: GCL-GCN effectively addresses limitations in existing models, offering superior clustering performance and robustness.

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

*Youngmin Seo,Yunhyeong Kwon,Younghun Park,HwiRyong Kim,Seungho Eum,Jinha Kim,Taigon Song,Juho Kim,Unsang Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism for IR drop estimation in VLSI design, improving accuracy by adaptively balancing feature channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation-based solvers for IR drop estimation are computationally expensive and hard to scale, necessitating a more efficient and accurate method.

Method: The authors reformulate IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task using multi-channel physical maps and introduce WACA to enhance weak features while suppressing dominant ones.

Result: On the ICCAD-2023 benchmark, the method reduces mean absolute error by 61.1% and improves F1-score by 71.0% compared to the contest winner.

Conclusion: Channel-wise heterogeneity is crucial for physical layout analysis in VLSI, and WACA effectively addresses this, offering significant performance gains.

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

### [50] [A Markov Categorical Framework for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19247)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using Markov Categories to analyze auto-regressive language models, explaining why NLL training yields versatile representations and linking it to spectral contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical understanding of why the simple NLL objective in auto-regressive models leads to powerful and versatile representations.

Method: Uses Markov Categories (MCs) to model the AR generation process and NLL objective, analyzing information flow and learned geometry through statistical divergences.

Result: The framework explains the success of speculative decoding methods, shows NLL captures intrinsic stochasticity, and proves NLL acts as implicit spectral contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals structural principles behind modern language models' effectiveness.

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

*Shuo Yang,Zheyu Zhang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPADA is a lightweight framework for tabular data augmentation that uses sparse dependency modeling to reduce bias and computational overhead, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality tabular datasets are scarce due to privacy and cost issues, and current LLM-based methods suffer from dense dependency bias and high computational costs.

Method: SPADA captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph, treating features as nodes and synthesizing values by traversing the graph. It employs Gaussian kernel density estimation or conditional normalizing flows for synthesis.

Result: SPADA reduces constraint violations by 4% and speeds up generation by 9,500 times compared to LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: SPADA effectively addresses limitations of existing tabular augmentation methods, offering a faster and more accurate solution.

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

*Chi-Ching Hsu,Gaëtan Frusque,Florent Forest,Felipe Macedo,Christian M. Franck,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised framework for fault detection and segmentation in high-voltage circuit breakers using vibration and acoustic signals, with explainable AI for diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing condition monitoring methods are limited to offline measurements and supervised approaches, which are impractical for real-world applications where fault labels are unavailable.

Method: An unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework using vibration and acoustic signals, combined with explainable AI for diagnostics.

Result: Validated on experimental data, the framework detects faults and clusters them without needing fault labels during training.

Conclusion: The approach enables reliable online condition monitoring and fault diagnostics without ground-truth labels, improving circuit breaker system operation.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

*Julia Siekiera,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores generating plausible counterfactual explanations for deep learning models in medical image analysis using a model-specific optimization approach combining VAEs and SPNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical image analysis lack interpretability, raising reliability concerns. Counterfactual explanations can address this but face challenges in plausibility and similarity constraints.

Method: The study uses a semi-supervised VAE's latent space modeled with an SPN to optimize counterfactuals, ensuring closeness to the original data and alignment with target class distributions. Experiments are conducted on the cheXpert dataset.

Result: The SPN-guided approach is compared to a neural network baseline, analyzing the trade-off between latent variable regularization and counterfactual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates interpretable counterfactuals, balancing plausibility and adherence to data distributions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

TL;DR: Automatic cough analysis using machine and deep learning shows promise for early NSCLC detection, with CNN achieving the highest accuracy (0.83). Fairness analysis reveals minor disparities across age and gender.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of NSCLC is crucial for better patient outcomes, and non-invasive tools like cough analysis could aid in pre-screening.

Method: Cough audio recordings from 227 subjects (NSCLC patients and healthy controls) were analyzed using SVM, XGBoost, CNN, and transfer learning (VGG16). SHAP was used for model interpretability, and fairness was assessed across age and gender.

Result: CNN performed best (accuracy: 0.83), while SVM was viable for low-resource settings (accuracy: 0.76-0.78). Fairness disparities were minor (age: 0.15, gender: 0.09).

Conclusion: Cough analysis is a promising pre-screening tool, but larger, diverse datasets are needed to improve reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines predictive multiplicity in medical ML models, showing that small ensembles can mitigate conflicting predictions, while standard metrics fail to identify optimal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the risk of conflicting predictions from equally valid ML models in medicine.

Method: Empirical analysis of predictive multiplicity across medical tasks and model architectures, using small ensembles and abstention strategies.

Result: Standard metrics don't identify optimal models; small ensembles reduce predictive multiplicity; higher model accuracy decreases multiplicity.

Conclusion: Ensembles improve diagnostic reliability; defer to experts when consensus is lacking.

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

<details>

Motivation: Addressing low hardware efficiency in LLMs, especially for long-context tasks, by optimizing decoding costs.

Method: Uses Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) to reduce KV cache and computation, and Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) for distributed inference.

Result: Step-3 reduces decoding costs, activates 38B parameters per token, and achieves 4,039 tokens/sec/GPU throughput, outperforming DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: Step-3's co-design sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding, proving hardware-aligned optimizations are key to cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and inaccuracy of static ML models and generic GNNs in high-energy physics under hardware constraints.

Method: Uses four graph construction strategies (station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, pseudorapidity-centric) with a novel Message Passing Layer and domain-specific loss functions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with fewer parameters than baselines, validated on the CMS Trigger Dataset.

Conclusion: Physics-guided GNNs show promise for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

TL;DR: Recent studies show LLMs are nearing superforecaster-level event forecasting performance, with reinforcement learning and reasoning models aiding progress. This paper advocates for large-scale training of such LLMs, addressing training challenges and data acquisition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to capitalize on recent advancements in LLMs and reinforcement learning to achieve superforecaster-level event forecasting, addressing current limitations and exploring scalable solutions.

Method: The paper discusses training methods (e.g., hypothetical event Bayesian networks, auxiliary rewards) and data acquisition (market, public, crawling datasets) to overcome challenges like noisiness-sparsity and knowledge cut-off.

Result: The paper outlines potential improvements in forecasting performance through proposed methods and large-scale data use, aiming for AI predictive intelligence.

Conclusion: The paper calls for research interest in advancing superforecaster-level AI technology, presenting specific paths and considerations for achieving this goal.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

*Chaithra Umesh,Kristian Schultz,Manjunath Mahendra,Saptarshi Bej,Olaf Wolkenhauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HFGF improves synthetic tabular data by preserving functional and logical dependencies, enhancing structural fidelity and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models often fail to preserve inter-attribute relationships like functional and logical dependencies, limiting synthetic data's usefulness in privacy-sensitive domains.

Method: Proposes HFGF, which first generates independent features using standard models, then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined rules. Evaluated on benchmark datasets with varying complexities.

Result: HFGF improves dependency preservation across six generative models, including CTGAN, TVAE, and GReaT.

Conclusion: HFGF significantly enhances the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

*Shaofan Wang,Nils Thuerey,Philipp Geyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning surrogate model (CBML) replaces CFD for fast indoor airflow and temperature prediction, using neural networks to achieve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD simulations are too slow for real-time or iterative workflows, necessitating a faster alternative.

Method: Proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML) approach with three neural networks: CAER for feature extraction, MLP for mapping, and CNN for aggregation.

Result: The CBML model accurately and quickly predicts velocity and temperature fields in training and testing datasets.

Conclusion: The CBML approach is effective for fast and accurate indoor airflow and temperature prediction, outperforming traditional CFD.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

*Andrii Dzhoha,Katya Mirylenka,Egor Malykh,Marco-Andrea Buchmann,Francesca Catino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in recommender systems for short-form video platforms, proposing a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model as a more effective solution than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of short-form video platforms and their adoption in domains like e-commerce has introduced new challenges for recommender systems, including limited interaction data, position bias, and duration bias.

Method: The authors propose leveraging a video retrieval system with a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to address these challenges.

Result: Online experiments on an e-commerce platform showed this approach outperformed conventional supervised learning methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of multimodal vision-language models in overcoming biases and improving recommendations for short-form video experiences.

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

*Lorenzo Mario Amorosa,Francesco Conti,Nicola Quercioli,Flavio Zabini,Tayebeh Lotfi Mahyari,Yiqun Ge,Patrizio Frosini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-complexity method using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) to reconstruct spatial signals like SINR maps in 6G networks from sparse measurements, outperforming traditional neural networks under data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient resource management in 6G networks requires high-resolution spatial signal knowledge (e.g., SINR maps), which is costly to acquire. Traditional methods like neural networks struggle with data scarcity and high complexity.

Method: The paper introduces a GENEO-based approach, leveraging mathematical tools from topological data analysis (TDA) to incorporate application-specific invariances, reducing parameters and enforcing geometric constraints.

Result: The GENEO framework achieves competitive performance in reconstructing SINR maps from extremely sparse samples, validated by statistical and TDA metrics.

Conclusion: GENEOs offer a promising, low-complexity alternative for spatial signal reconstruction in resource-constrained scenarios like 6G networks.

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict satellite and debris propagation in LEO efficiently without relying on computationally expensive high-fidelity models.

Method: Uses SINDy and LSTM algorithms to create a low-fidelity model from MOCAT-MC data for faster forecasting.

Result: Accurate modeling and prediction of LEO space objects (Active, Derelict, Debris) with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach provides a lightweight, efficient alternative to high-fidelity models for space object forecasting.

Abstract: Utilizing the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics algorithm (SINDy)
and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM), the population of
resident space objects, divided into Active, Derelict, and Debris, in LEO can
be accurately modeled to predict future satellite and debris propagation. This
proposed approach makes use of a data set coming from a computational expensive
high-fidelity model, the MOCAT-MC, to provide a light, low-fidelity counterpart
that provides accurate forecasting in a shorter time frame.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares classical, quantum, and quantum-hybrid machine learning models for fraud detection, finding classical models like Random Forest outperform quantum ones, though QSVM shows promise. It also proposes FD4QC, a practical system for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of fraud detection in complex financial transactions by exploring the potential of quantum and hybrid machine learning models.

Method: Develops a feature engineering framework, evaluates classical (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and quantum-hybrid (QSVM, VQC, HQNN) models on the IBM AML dataset, and proposes the FD4QC system.

Result: Random Forest outperforms quantum models (97.34% accuracy, 86.95% F-measure). QSVM shows promise with 77.15% precision and 1.36% false-positive rate but has computational overhead.

Conclusion: Classical models currently outperform quantum ones for fraud detection, but quantum models like QSVM have potential. The FD4QC system offers a practical deployment framework, and future research directions are outlined.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,
and outlines promising directions for future research.

### [65] [SILS: Strategic Influence on Liquidity Stability and Whale Detection in Concentrated-Liquidity DEXs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19411)
*Ali RajabiNekoo,Laleh Rasoul,Amirfarhad Farhadi,Azadeh Zamanifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SILS framework introduces a dynamic, impact-focused approach to identify high-impact liquidity providers (LPs) in CLMMs, using ETWL profiles and LSIS scores for accurate risk analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for LP analysis are static and volume-based, leading to inaccurate risk assessments. SILS aims to provide a more detailed and realistic understanding of LP impact.

Method: Uses on-chain event logs and smart contract traces to compute ETWL profiles and applies unsupervised anomaly detection. Introduces LSIS, a counterfactual metric to measure LP impact.

Result: SILS accurately identifies high-impact LPs, reduces false positives/negatives, and enhances DeFi ecosystem transparency and risk management.

Conclusion: SILS transforms LP analysis by focusing on dynamic impact, enabling proactive risk management and better safeguarding DeFi protocols.

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

*Yuliang Gu,Hongpeng Cao,Marco Caccamo,Naira Hovakimyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual inference-control framework for context-based RL, optimizing representation and policy learning separately via BCPO, achieving robust performance beyond training regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying RL agents in varying contexts by capturing latent variations and ensuring predictive and decision-making relevance.

Method: Proposes a contextual ELBO-style objective and BCPO algorithm, using a variational information-bottleneck encoder for off-policy learning.

Result: BCPO outperforms baselines in continuous-control benchmarks, requiring fewer samples and maintaining performance outside training regimes.

Conclusion: The framework unifies theory, diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) is introduced to enhance interpretability of Random Forests by grouping instances via shared decision paths, offering human-readable clusters and feature importance scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable and trustworthy machine learning models, especially in sensitive applications, drives the development of FGC to address the opacity of Random Forests.

Method: FGC groups instances based on shared decision paths in Random Forests, generating interpretable clusters and computing feature importance scores to explain predictions.

Result: FGC outperformed traditional clustering and explanation methods, accurately identifying latent structures in benchmark data and biologically relevant patterns in AML transcriptomic data.

Conclusion: FGC successfully bridges the gap between model performance and interpretability, providing deeper insights into Random Forests' decision-making processes.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

*Mingjie Bi,Dawn M. Tilbury,Siqian Shen,Kira Barton*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores agile disruption mitigation in supply chains using distributed decision-making, analyzing performance based on network attributes and comparing it to centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent disruptions negatively impact global supply chains, necessitating agile decision-making strategies for competitiveness.

Method: Characterizes supply chains from capability and network topology perspectives, using a distributed multi-agent framework, and evaluates performance via a case study.

Result: Distributed decision-making shows trade-offs in performance, computation time, and communication compared to centralized approaches, influenced by network structure and agent attributes.

Conclusion: Practitioners can design response strategies using insights on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the frequent occurrence of disruptions has had a negative
impact on global supply chains. To stay competitive, enterprises strive to
remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective
decision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has
been made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging
both centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs
of centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing
studies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain
performance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain
entities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and
network topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed
decision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The
performance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive
case study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function
of the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the
presence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach
highlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network
communication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture.
Practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies
based on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain
performance.

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for dynamic resource allocation in manufacturing during disruptions like COVID-19, incorporating risk assessment to improve throughput and reduce computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic caused market shifts and workforce shortages, necessitating flexible, real-time manufacturing strategies to handle disruptions like machine breakdowns.

Method: Proposes a model-based resource agent (RA) architecture for coordination and dynamic decision-making, with a rescheduling strategy using risk assessment and clustering agent coordination.

Result: The method reduces computational effort but slightly loses throughput optimality compared to centralized methods. Risk assessment in rescheduling improves throughput.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework effectively addresses dynamic resource allocation challenges, balancing computational efficiency and throughput, especially under disruptions.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brings many unexpected disruptions, such as frequently
shifting markets and limited human workforce, to manufacturers. To stay
competitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies
are needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One
essential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks,
especially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though
multi-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and
agile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource
uncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based
resource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and
dynamic agent decision-making. Based on the RA architecture, a rescheduling
strategy that incorporates risk assessment via a clustering agent coordination
strategy is also proposed. A simulation-based case study is implemented to
demonstrate dynamic rescheduling using the proposed multi-agent framework. The
results show that the proposed method reduces the computational efforts while
losing some throughput optimality compared to the centralized method.
Furthermore, the case study illustrates that incorporating risk assessment into
rescheduling decision-making improves the throughput.

*Mingjie Bi,Juan-Alberto Estrada-Garcia,Dawn M. Tilbury,Siqian Shen,Kira Barton*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A heterogeneous risk management mechanism is proposed for distributed supply chain agents to handle disruptions dynamically, considering uncertainties and varying risk attitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of temporal dynamics and agent heterogeneity in existing risk management approaches for supply chains.

Method: Develops a heterogeneous risk management mechanism integrating uncertainties and risk attitudes into agent communication and decision-making.

Result: Simulated case study demonstrates the approach's feasibility and effectiveness, showing how risk attitudes influence disruption responses.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism enables distributed, agile responses to disruptions in stochastic supply chain environments.

Abstract: In the highly complex and stochastic global, supply chain environments, local
enterprise agents seek distributed and dynamic strategies for agile responses
to disruptions. Existing literature explores both centralized and distributed
approaches, while most work neglects temporal dynamics and the heterogeneity of
the risk management of individual agents. To address this gap, this letter
presents a heterogeneous risk management mechanism to incorporate uncertainties
and risk attitudes into agent communication and decision-making strategy.
Hence, this approach empowers enterprises to handle disruptions in stochastic
environments in a distributed way, and in particular in the context of
multi-agent control and management. Through a simulated case study, we showcase
the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach under stochastic
settings and how the decision of disruption responses changes when agents hold
various risk attitudes.
