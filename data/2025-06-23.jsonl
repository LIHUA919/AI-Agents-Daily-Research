Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search\nas a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy\nthat maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed\nrollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of\nexisting search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning\ndirections with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and\ninefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented\nResource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias\nby decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources\nat the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct\nextensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks\nincluding MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025.

LazyEviction is an\nObservation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring\ntokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two\nkey components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal\nvariations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric\nEviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by\n50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance\nof preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge\ncontinuity in multi-step reasoning tasks."}

While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their\ninterpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in\nAPIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples\nwhile minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context\nwindow for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to\nthe LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This\nconstraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning\nprompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs\ncontinue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,\nsoft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.\nFor instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these\nissues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that\nenables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently\ntransfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to\nderive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt\ntransferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential\nprivacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small\npublic dataset.

Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these\ndistinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple\nsub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models\nthat can transform the processing of relational data."}

In this work, we systematically investigate\nthis question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and\ncompute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)\ncolumn-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of\nplain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only\nto the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance\ncompetitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,\nwe propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new\noptimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where\ncolumn normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output\ndimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the\nperformance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory.

In this paper, we propose a novel method,\n$\\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL\nagents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder\nworks by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to\ncompleting a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to\nidentify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to\nrank them using pairwise comparisons.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition\ncan be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates\nthat the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter\nefficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes\nTensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these\nlimitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices\nthrough a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The\nresulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank\nadaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and\nparameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.\nTheoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel\nanalyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2\nfine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently\noutperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and\nscalability with fewer parameters."}

MTL typically accomplishes this goal by\nlearning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks\nby embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being\ndesigned to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively\nlearn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can\ninadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were\ntrained on.\n  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared\nrepresentations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose\na novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the\nembedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples\nfrom a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when\ntraining the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box\nattacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between\nembeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled\nreference data.

To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust\nevaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,\nthe communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a\ntrusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and\nrepresented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures\ntrust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison\nwith data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,\nthe collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as\ntask completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with\nan ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A\nreal system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to\ntest the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework.

Beyond Equality of Opportunity", "comment": "Accepted for presentation at ACM FAccT 2025; under final review\n  (minor revision) at an ACM journal", "summary": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to\naddress this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,\nspecifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We\nmodel the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential\ndecision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting\ncomputation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a\npotentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the\nintrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary\ntheoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of\ndiminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping\ndepth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this\ninsight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm\ndepth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to\nefficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by\nextending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to\ncontinuous-depth models via free-boundary problems.

However, rapidly and\ncontinuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task\nexecution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex\noperational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust\nevaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,\nthe communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a\ntrusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and\nrepresented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures\ntrust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison\nwith data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,\nthe collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as\ntask completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with\nan ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A\nreal system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to\ntest the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and\nachieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline\nalgorithm."}

State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on\nimproving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are\npractically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of\nminutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.\nTo understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of\ncomputer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of\ncomputer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We\nfind that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the\nmajority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a\ntask, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a\ntask. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the\noriginal OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each\ntask. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found\nthat even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than\nnecessary."}

These features are typically used as inputs to machine\nlearning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such\napproaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing\nperformance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem\ncharacteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best\nrepresented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data\nstructures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization\nalgorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm\nconfigurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,\nmodCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free\noptimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy\n(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576\nmodDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem\ndimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional\ntabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning\nin black-box optimization."}

However,\nexisting static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess\nrisks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic\nrisks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc\nevaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,\nwe propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive\nemergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We\nthus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive\nsafety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks\ninstantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel\nprocess-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are\nperformed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on\nleading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current\nagents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware\nChain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.\nBy highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for\ndeveloping safer and more reliable embodied AI systems."}

A promising pathway toward this\ntransition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate\nand optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.\nWhile LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are\noften unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the\nexploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies\nand suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a\nnovel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by\nemploying a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master\nto efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories\nwith analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the\nagent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it\nachieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,\nparticularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior\nperformance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used\nby previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a\npowerful tool for advancing AI4AI."}

However, existing research suffers\nfrom two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish\nparticipation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the\nsystem or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From\nthe mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be\nunsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for\ndata collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by\ncontributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware\nframework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to\naccelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion\nof Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and\nreformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful\nreporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of\nany two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score\nfunctions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that\nformalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium.
