### [1] [The Indispensable Role of User Simulation in the Pursuit of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19456)
*Krisztian Balog,ChengXiang Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: User simulation is a critical catalyst for overcoming AGI development bottlenecks by providing scalable evaluation environments and generating interaction data for training adaptive agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress toward AGI faces significant bottlenecks in evaluating complex interactive systems and acquiring vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.

Method: The paper argues for creating computational agents that mimic human interaction with AI systems (user simulation) as essential infrastructure for AGI development.

Result: The analysis identifies that realistic simulators provide necessary environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning, and fostering adaptive capabilities central to AGI.

Conclusion: Research into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply synergistic and must advance together, with a proposed future research agenda addressing key challenges including those posed by large language models.

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

### [2] [Evaluation-Aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19464)
*Shripad Vilasrao Deshmukh,Will Schwarzer,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Evaluation-aware Reinforcement Learning (EvA-RL), a new paradigm where policies are trained to maximize return while minimizing evaluation error, enabling more reliable policy assessment with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods suffer from high variance (due to limited data and long horizons) or high bias (due to unequal support or inaccurate models) in policy evaluation. This work addresses the fundamental challenge that policies are trained without explicit consideration of how they will be evaluated.

Method: EvA-RL trains policies to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme. The approach includes co-learning an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy to mitigate the tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance.

Result: Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains show that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns compared to standard RL approaches.

Conclusion: EvA-RL establishes a foundation for a new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training, addressing key limitations of current policy evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

### [3] [Estimating the Self-Consistency of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19489)
*Robert Nowak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of self-consistency estimator for LLMs under fixed compute budget, showing optimal split between prompt sampling and repeated calls is proportional to square root of budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systems often repeat prompts to LLMs and aggregate responses for reliability improvement, but there's a need to understand the tradeoffs in self-consistency estimation under computational constraints.

Method: Theoretical analysis of an estimator for LLM self-consistency under fixed compute budget B=mn, where m is number of prompts sampled from task distribution and n is number of repeated LLM calls per prompt.

Result: The analysis reveals that the optimal tradeoff favors a rough split where both m and n are proportional to √B, balancing prompt diversity and repetition depth.

Conclusion: For fixed compute budgets, the optimal strategy for estimating LLM self-consistency involves roughly equal allocation between sampling diverse prompts and repeating calls per prompt, with both scaling as the square root of the total budget.

Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and
aggregate responses to improve reliability. This short note analyzes an
estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a
fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from
the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt;
the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.

### [4] [Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517)
*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formal theory of computational cognitive load in LLMs, identifying Context Saturation and Attentional Residue as key mechanisms that degrade reasoning performance. The authors developed the ICE benchmark to systematically test these factors and found significant performance variations across models, with smaller models showing complete brittleness while larger models exhibited partial resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical gap between LLMs' performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. The computational limits governing reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood, despite models excelling at isolated tasks.

Method: The authors introduced a formal theory of computational cognitive load and designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE) benchmark to systematically manipulate Context Saturation (task-irrelevant information) and Attentional Residue (task-switching interference) on multi-hop reasoning tasks. They conducted a comprehensive study with 10 replications per item across 200 questions on five instruction-tuned models.

Result: Smaller open-source models (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) showed complete brittleness with 0% accuracy across all conditions. Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 demonstrated partial resilience with 85% accuracy in control conditions, but showed statistically significant degradation under context saturation. The findings support theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty.

Conclusion: Cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures in LLMs. Dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

### [5] [Score the Steps, Not Just the Goal: VLM-Based Subgoal Evaluation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19524)
*Ramy ElMallah,Krish Chhajer,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepEval is a cost-aware evaluation framework that uses vision-language models to provide per-subgoal success rates instead of just binary final outcomes, enabling more detailed analysis of robot learning policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot learning papers only report single binary success rates, which obscures where policies succeed or fail in multi-step manipulation tasks. This makes partial competence invisible.

Method: Proposes StepEval framework using VLMs as automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images/videos. It's designed as a model-agnostic, lightweight, community-driven open-source project with per-subgoal SR vectors as primary evaluation artifact.

Result: The framework enables detailed subgoal-level reporting that reveals partial competence (e.g., grasp vs. pour success), supports single/multi-view inputs, and includes diagnostics for tuning evaluation efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: StepEval provides a minimal, extensible foundation for making subgoal-level evaluation standard practice in robot learning, inviting community contributions to improve reproducibility and detailed policy analysis.

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

### [6] [Nano Bio-Agents (NBA): Small Language Model Agents for Genomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19566)
*George Hong,Daniel Trejo Banos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small Language Models (3-10B parameters) combined with an agentic framework achieve high accuracy (85-98%) on genomics QA tasks while reducing computational costs compared to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination issues and computational cost challenges in genomics question answering by leveraging smaller, more efficient language models through an agentic framework.

Method: Developed Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework incorporating task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access to systems like NCBI and AlphaGenome, applied to Small Language Models (<10B parameters).

Result: SLMs with NBA framework achieved 98% accuracy on GeneTuring benchmark, with 3-10B parameter models consistently achieving 85-97% accuracy while requiring significantly lower computational resources than conventional approaches.

Conclusion: Small language models combined with agentic frameworks offer promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while maintaining robust and accurate performance.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion
parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address
hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent
(NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool
orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and
AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can
achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing
approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination
achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B
parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much
lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate
performance.

### [7] [What Does Your Benchmark Really Measure? A Framework for Robust Inference of AI Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19590)
*Nathanael Jo,Ashia Wilson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a principled framework for AI evaluation as inference, addressing reliability issues in benchmark testing by treating evaluations as inferences based on theories of capability rather than simple measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmark evaluations are increasingly questioned for reliability, as they treat benchmark scores as direct measurements rather than inferences based on theoretical assumptions about what capability is and how it manifests in tests.

Method: The authors propose a framework that begins with a theory of capability and derives methods for estimating it, introducing approaches that account for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm to reduce sample complexity.

Result: The framework provides more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities by explicitly modeling evaluation as inference and addressing key challenges like sensitivity to perturbations.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for more principled AI evaluation methods that treat benchmark scores as inferences rather than simple measurements, improving reliability and trustworthiness of capability assessments.

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

### [8] [SteinerSQL: Graph-Guided Mathematical Reasoning for Text-to-SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19623)
*Xutao Mao,Tao Liu,Hongying Zan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SteinerSQL is a new framework that unifies mathematical reasoning and schema navigation for complex Text-to-SQL queries by treating them as a graph-centric optimization problem, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries requiring both mathematical reasoning and schema navigation. Existing methods handle these challenges separately, leading to fractured reasoning processes that compromise logical and structural correctness.

Method: SteinerSQL operates in three stages: 1) mathematical decomposition to identify required tables (terminals), 2) optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a Steiner tree problem, and 3) multi-level validation to ensure correctness.

Result: On LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL achieves 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy respectively using Gemini-2.5-Pro, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SteinerSQL presents a unified paradigm for Text-to-SQL that paves the way for more robust and principled solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified
paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled
solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced test-time computing strategies are limited by models' poor self-evaluation capabilities, which caps their effectiveness in scaling reasoning models.

Method: Propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier trained via reinforcement learning (GRPO) that generates calibrated confidence scores and associated natural language reasoning for generated solutions.

Result: The verifier improves accuracy and efficiency of test-time strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection, and excels at identifying challenging failure modes where standard methods like majority voting fail.

Conclusion: The pairwise Explanatory Verifier with GRPO training effectively addresses self-evaluation limitations in reasoning models, enabling more robust test-time computing strategies.

Abstract: Advanced test-time computing strategies are essential for scaling reasoning
models, but their effectiveness is capped by the models' poor self-evaluation.
We propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier, trained via reinforcement learning
(GRPO), that produces calibrated confidence scores and associated natural
language reasoning for generated solutions. Our verifier improves the accuracy
and efficiency of test-time strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection.
Crucially, it excels at identifying challenging failure modes, such as when
both candidate solutions are identically incorrect, succeeding where standard
methods like majority voting fail.

*Cheng Qian,Zuxin Liu,Akshara Prabhakar,Jielin Qiu,Zhiwei Liu,Haolin Chen,Shirley Kokane,Heng Ji,Weiran Yao,Shelby Heinecke,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UserRL is a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric AI agents through standardized gym environments with simulated users, focusing on reward shaping and trajectory scoring to improve multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL shows promise for agentic models but faces challenges with diverse user interactions. The ultimate value of agents lies in their ability to assist users effectively.

Method: Proposes UserRL framework using standardized gym environments with simulated users, systematically varying turn-level rewards and trajectory-level scores under GRPO algorithm across Qwen3 models.

Result: Three key findings: SFT cold start is critical for initial interaction ability; deliberate trajectory scoring improves multi-turn interactions; open-source simulators are cost-effective alternatives to stronger simulated users.

Conclusion: Careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, establishing UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CEPO, an optimized reasoning workflow that enables smaller open-source models to outperform larger models by addressing inefficiencies in modern LLM reasoning caused by model verbosity and poor instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation but suffers from inefficiencies due to model verbosity and poor instruction following, leading to wasted compute. The authors aim to optimize the capability-cost trade-off.

Method: The authors introduce CEPO, an optimized reasoning workflow that co-designs orchestration frameworks with underlying model capabilities to improve efficiency.

Result: CEPO empowers smaller open-source models to outperform models multiple times their size, demonstrating improved reasoning capabilities in small-to-medium sized models.

Conclusion: The work shows a clear path toward co-designing orchestration frameworks with model capabilities to unlock powerful reasoning in smaller models, and the workflow will be open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source
models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this
workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

### [12] [Agentic Metacognition: Designing a "Self-Aware" Low-Code Agent for Failure Prediction and Human Handoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19783)
*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a metacognitive layer for LCNC agents that predicts failures and initiates human handoffs, improving reliability and trust at the cost of computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliability challenges of non-deterministic autonomous agents in LCNC environments, which can get trapped in loops, generate inaccurate outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and trust breakdown.

Method: Integration of a secondary metacognitive layer that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent, predicting impending task failures based on triggers like excessive latency or repetitive actions, and proactively initiating human handoffs with transparency.

Result: Empirical analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly increases overall task success rate, though with notable computational overhead increase.

Conclusion: Human handoffs should be reframed as a core design feature that enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust through transparency. The paper discusses practical/ethical implications and future research directions.

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

### [13] [Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800)
*Donghwan Lee,Hyukjun Yang,Bum Geun Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs using log-barrier functions to transform inequality-constrained optimization into unconstrained gradient descent problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LP-based methods for MDPs have been underused compared to dynamic programming approaches due to the difficulty of solving inequality-constrained optimization problems. The authors aim to make LP-based methods more practical and effective.

Method: The paper leverages the log-barrier function from inequality-constrained optimization to transform the LP formulation of MDPs into an unconstrained optimization problem, enabling approximate solutions via gradient descent.

Result: The method provides a theoretical framework for solving LP-based MDPs more effectively, though specific numerical results are not mentioned in the abstract.

Conclusion: This work bridges the theoretical gap in using log-barrier functions for LP-based MDPs, potentially making these methods more accessible and practical for applications like offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATENTGUARD is a three-stage framework combining behavioral alignment with supervised latent space control for interpretable safety steering in LLMs, achieving selective refusal behavior while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained controllability at the representation level in large language models.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tuning on rationalized datasets with reasoning-enhanced responses, 2) Training structured VAE on MLP activations with multi-label supervision, 3) Targeted manipulation of learned latent dimensions for selective refusal behavior.

Result: Experiments on Qwen3-8B show significant improvements in safety controllability and response interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on Mistral-7B confirms generalizability.

Conclusion: Structured representation-level intervention offers a promising pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

*Ajeet Kumar Singh,Rajsabi Surya,Anurag Tripathi,Santanu Choudhury,Sudhir Bisane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CON-QA is a hybrid privacy-preserving framework that enables secure question answering over enterprise contracts by combining local and cloud-based LLMs while protecting sensitive information through sophisticated anonymization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As enterprises increasingly use cloud-based LLMs for legal document workflows, there's a critical need to protect sensitive contractual information (PII and commercial clauses) from privacy risks while maintaining utility.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) semantic query decomposition and document chunk retrieval using local LLM, (2) anonymization of sensitive entities via structured one-to-many mapping, (3) cloud-based LLM response generation with local reconstruction using session-consistent reverse mapping.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CUAD-QA corpus (85k QA pairs from 510 real contracts) show CON-QA effectively maintains privacy and utility, preserves answer quality and legal semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks.

Conclusion: CON-QA demonstrates practical suitability for secure enterprise-level contract document processing by successfully balancing privacy protection with functional utility through its hybrid architecture.

Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

*Wenliang Li,Rui Yan,Xu Zhang,Li Chen,Hongji Zhu,Jing Zhao,Junjun Li,Mengru Li,Wei Cao,Zihang Jiang,Wei Wei,Kun Zhang,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD) framework that enables LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge through multi-agent collaboration, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and achieving performance comparable to or exceeding human physicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches in medical diagnosis optimize isolated inferences but neglect the accumulation of reusable clinical experience, failing to mirror how physicians develop expertise through experience.

Method: A multi-agent pipeline where LLM-based diagnostician agents summarize, refine, and apply diagnostic insights through iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and human oversight for difficult cases.

Result: MACD improves primary diagnostic accuracy by up to 22.3% over clinical guidelines, achieves up to 16% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis, and the MACD-human workflow shows 18.6% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis across 4,390 real-world cases.

Conclusion: The framework presents a scalable self-learning paradigm that bridges the gap between LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and real-world clinical practice, with strong cross-model stability and explainable rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical
applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex
real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current
prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated
inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To
address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

*Aymeric Vellinger,Nemanja Antonic,Elio Tuci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in C. elegans and reinforcement learning, showing how stigmergic signals function as distributed reward mechanisms in swarm intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge synthetic biology with swarm robotics by demonstrating that stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed reinforcement learning processes, advancing programmable living systems for resilient decision-making in volatile environments.

Method: Modeled engineered nematode swarms performing foraging tasks, showing pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror cross-learning updates. Validated with literature data and conducted computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios.

Result: The model accurately replicates empirical C. elegans foraging patterns. In dynamic environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that hinder adaptation, but introducing a minority of exploratory agents restores collective plasticity and enables rapid task switching.

Conclusion: Stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes where environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment. Behavioral heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances
programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile
environments.

### [19] [Steerable Adversarial Scenario Generation through Test-Time Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20102)
*Tong Nie,Yuewen Mei,Yihong Tang,Junlin He,Jie Sun,Haotian Shi,Wei Ma,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a steerable adversarial scenario generator that enables fine-grained control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism in autonomous driving scenario generation without retraining, using hierarchical preference optimization and weight interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial scenario generation methods are constrained to fixed trade-offs between objectives like adversariality and realism, lacking flexibility for diverse training/testing requirements. This creates behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time.

Method: Proposes hierarchical group-based preference optimization to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard constraints from soft preferences. Fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs continuous policies via linear weight interpolation at inference time, supported by linear mode connectivity theory.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAGE generates scenarios with superior balance of adversariality and realism, and enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies compared to fixed-trade-off approaches.

Conclusion: Reframing adversarial scenario generation as multi-objective preference alignment with steerable inference provides efficient and flexible scenario generation tailored to diverse requirements, overcoming limitations of behavior-specific models.

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with maintaining coherent multi-step reasoning traces that require structured logical flow, which limits their performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Incorporates a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization to guide learning through structural consistency rather than direct supervision or contrastive objectives.

Result: Significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches on datasets like GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank across multiple coherence-determining metrics.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired fidelity provides an effective foundation to improve reasoning trace coherence in LLMs, demonstrating the value of structural consistency approaches for enhancing multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning
trace coherence in LLMs.

TL;DR: Federation of Agents (FoA) is a distributed orchestration framework that enables dynamic, capability-driven collaboration among AI agents through semantic routing, dynamic task decomposition, and smart clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transform static multi-agent coordination into dynamic collaboration by making agent capabilities searchable and enabling efficient task matching and decomposition.

Method: Uses Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs) for machine-readable agent profiles, semantic routing with HNSW indices, dynamic task decomposition through consensus-based merging, and smart clustering for collaborative refinement.

Result: Achieves 13x improvements over single-model baselines on HealthBench, with particularly effective performance on complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives.

Conclusion: Semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents while maintaining scalable performance.

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-world deployment study of cooperative lane-change prediction systems, highlighting practical challenges and lessons learned from hardware implementation in mixed traffic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing lane-change prediction research relies on simulations or pre-recorded datasets with simplified assumptions that don't reflect real-world conditions. There's a lack of documentation about practical challenges in real deployments.

Method: The study implements cooperative lane-change prediction through actual hardware deployment in mixed traffic scenarios, focusing on real-world implementation and testing.

Result: The research identified practical challenges including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that significantly impacted system behavior during real-world deployment.

Conclusion: By documenting practical experiences and challenges, this study provides valuable guidance for future implementations of similar cooperative lane-change prediction systems in real-world settings.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar
pipelines.

*Xingjian Kang,Linda Vorberg,Andreas Maier,Alexander Katzmann,Oliver Taubmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based agent framework is proposed to automate CT scan protocol management using natural language, improving workflow efficiency by reducing technologists' workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing CT scan protocols is time-consuming and requires expertise, while there's an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology.

Method: The framework combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling to interpret natural language requests and generate device-compatible protocol files.

Result: Experimental results show the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate compatible files, and implement user requests.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility for LLM-based agents in CT protocol management, though limitations exist regarding device API standardization and handling complex requests.

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.

*Yifu Luo,Yongzhe Chang,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WFDiffuser is a diffusion-based RL framework that addresses frequency shift issues in existing methods by incorporating wavelet and Fourier transforms for frequency-domain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RL approaches focus only on time-domain features, causing frequency shift that degrades performance. The paper aims to solve this by analyzing RL from a frequency-domain perspective.

Method: Proposes WFDiffuser framework using Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low/high-frequency components, then applies Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms for frequency feature extraction and interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmark show WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, producing smoother trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrating frequency-domain analysis through wavelet and Fourier transforms significantly enhances diffusion-based RL by addressing frequency shift issues and improving trajectory stability.

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

*Mashkhal Abdalwahid Sidiq,Yimamu Kirubel Wondaferew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using deep learning and centrality algorithms for money laundering detection in financial networks, showing superiority over traditional rule-based AML systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AML systems have high false positive rates and lack sophistication to detect complex money laundering schemes, creating a need for more advanced detection methods.

Method: The paper implements an advanced AML system using deep learning techniques with centrality algorithms (Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, PageRank) for link analysis in financial transaction networks.

Result: The GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) model demonstrated practicality and superiority for analyzing transaction data in its financial context, showing improved detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Integrating deep learning with centrality algorithms enhances AML system effectiveness and represents a promising direction for future anti-money laundering efforts.

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

*Benedikt W. Hosp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepACTIF is a lightweight, architecture-aware feature attribution method for sequence models that uses internal activations to efficiently estimate feature importance, outperforming standard methods like SHAP and IG while enabling real-time interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard feature attribution methods (Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time applications in time-series domains like healthcare and biometrics.

Method: Leverages internal activations of LSTM-based networks with inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasizes stability and magnitude of activations across time steps.

Result: Outperforms SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT in accuracy and statistical robustness; preserves predictive performance with top 10% features; reduces computation time and memory usage by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: DeepACTIF is a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices like mobile XR headsets and embedded health monitors.

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

*Zhuqi Wang,Qinghe Zhang,Zhuopei Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid method using Enhanced ANFIS with wavelet decomposition and temporal attention for credit card fraud detection, achieving 17.8% RMSE reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit card fraud poses significant threats to household finances and causes unpredictable economic behavior changes, requiring advanced detection methods.

Method: Enhanced ANFIS framework with multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, temporal attention mechanism, discrete wavelet transformations on transaction data and economic indicators, deep fuzzy rule library with adaptive Gaussian membership functions.

Result: Experimental results show 17.8% reduction in RMSE compared to local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method effectively improves fraud detection by integrating wavelet analysis, temporal attention, and adaptive fuzzy inference, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

### [30] [Representation-based Broad Hallucination Detectors Fail to Generalize Out of Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19372)
*Zuzanna Dubanowska,Maciej Żelaszczyk,Michał Brzozowski,Paolo Mandica,Michał Karpowicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current SOTA hallucination detection methods perform poorly due to spurious correlations with data rather than genuine detection capabilities, with no better performance than simple supervised linear probes after controlling for confounding factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the true effectiveness of state-of-the-art hallucination detection methods and identify their limitations, particularly regarding spurious correlations and generalization capabilities.

Method: Analyzed current SOTA hallucination detection methods on the RAGTruth dataset, controlled for spurious correlations, compared performance against supervised linear probes, and evaluated out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: SOTA methods' performance is largely driven by spurious data correlations rather than genuine detection ability. After controlling for this effect, they perform no better than simple supervised linear probes. All methods show poor out-of-distribution generalization, performing close to random.

Conclusion: Current hallucination detection methods have significant limitations, particularly regarding spurious correlations and poor generalization. The authors propose guidelines for improved hallucination detection evaluation and development.

Abstract: We critically assess the efficacy of the current SOTA in hallucination
detection and find that its performance on the RAGTruth dataset is largely
driven by a spurious correlation with data. Controlling for this effect,
state-of-the-art performs no better than supervised linear probes, while
requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Out-of-distribution
generalization is currently out of reach, with all of the analyzed methods
performing close to random. We propose a set of guidelines for hallucination
detection and its evaluation.

*Mridul Sharma,Adeetya Patel,Zaneta D' Souza,Samira Abbasgholizadeh Rahimi,Siva Reddy,Sreenath Madathil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to improve uncertainty quantification in LLMs for clinical diagnostics, addressing overconfidence in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with uncertainty expression, which is critical for reliable deployment in high-stakes domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing methods produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates.

Method: Uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference approach that treats LLMs as stochastic simulators to infer posterior distributions over predictive probabilities.

Result: ABC improves accuracy by up to 46.9%, reduces Brier scores by 74.4%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy on clinical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The ABC approach significantly outperforms standard baselines in uncertainty quantification for LLMs in clinical diagnostic tasks, providing more reliable probability estimates.

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often
struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in
high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing
standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

*Matthew Grofsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses temporal failures in RAG systems using two methods on cybersecurity data, finding that a recency prior works well for freshness tasks but clustering heuristics fail for trend detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address temporal failures in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly in handling time-sensitive cybersecurity data where freshness and trend detection are critical.

Method: Used two approaches: (1) a simple recency prior for freshness detection, and (2) a clustering heuristic for topic evolution and trend detection on cybersecurity data.

Result: The recency prior achieved perfect accuracy (1.00) on freshness tasks, while the clustering heuristic performed poorly with only 0.08 F1-score on trend detection tasks.

Conclusion: Simple heuristics like recency priors are effective for freshness detection, but trend detection requires more sophisticated methods beyond basic clustering approaches.

Abstract: We address temporal failures in RAG systems using two methods on
cybersecurity data. A simple recency prior achieved an accuracy of 1.00 on
freshness tasks. In contrast, a clustering heuristic for topic evolution failed
(0.08 F1-score), showing trend detection requires methods beyond simple
heuristics.

### [33] [Learning from Observation: A Survey of Recent Advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19379)
*Returaj Burnwal,Hriday Mehta,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey paper on Learning from Observation (LfO) or state-only imitation learning, which addresses the limitation of requiring expert action information in traditional imitation learning by using only expert state visitation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imitation learning requires expert state and action information, but expert actions are often impractical to obtain in real-world applications. LfO/SOIL provides an alternative approach using only state information.

Method: The paper presents a framework for LfO and uses it to survey and classify existing LfO methods based on trajectory construction, assumptions, and algorithm design choices. It also connects LfO with related fields like offline RL, model-based RL, and hierarchical RL.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive classification of LfO methods and identifies connections with other reinforcement learning fields, offering a structured understanding of the current state of LfO research.

Conclusion: The framework helps identify open problems in LfO and suggests future research directions for advancing state-only imitation learning methods.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

*Axel Marmoret,Reda Bensaid,Jonathan Lys,Vincent Gripon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensLoRA is a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors, enabling more efficient and flexible low-rank adaptation of Transformers with mode-specific compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA treats attention projection matrices independently for each Query, Key, and Value across layers, lacking systematic joint adaptation. Recent extensions have limited tensor-based approaches without a comprehensive framework.

Method: TensLoRA aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors, modeling a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. It generalizes existing tensor methods and allows mode-specific compression rates for tailored parameter allocation.

Result: Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes outperforming standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

Conclusion: TensLoRA provides a systematic framework for tensor-based low-rank adaptation that enables more efficient parameter usage and can achieve better performance than standard LoRA approaches.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA
under similar parameter counts.

TL;DR: OmniFed is a modular federated learning framework that provides configuration-driven prototyping, support for different topologies and communication protocols, privacy mechanisms, and compression strategies through well-defined extension points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is critical for edge and HPC environments where data cannot be centralized and privacy is crucial, but existing solutions lack the flexibility and modularity needed for heterogeneous deployments.

Method: OmniFed uses a decoupled architecture with clear separation of concerns for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic.

Conclusion: OmniFed successfully addresses the need for flexible, modular federated learning frameworks that can adapt to diverse deployment scenarios while maintaining system integrity through well-defined extension points.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing

a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns
for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its
architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level

### [36] [TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406)
*Kuiye Ding,Fanda Fan,Chunyi Hou,Zheya Wang,Lei Wang,Zhengxin Yang,Jianfeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeMosaic is a multivariate time series forecasting framework that addresses temporal heterogeneity through adaptive patch embedding and segment-wise decoding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch-based methods use fixed-length segmentation, which overlooks heterogeneity in local temporal dynamics and decoding requirements, leading to information loss in dense regions and redundancy in stable segments.

Method: TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity based on local information density, and introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a separate subtask with horizon-specific adaptation.

Result: Extensive evaluations show TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and when trained on a large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations, achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Conclusion: The proposed TimeMosaic framework effectively addresses temporal heterogeneity in multivariate time series forecasting through its adaptive patch embedding and segment-wise decoding approach, demonstrating superior performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

*Obu-Amoah Ampomah,Edmund Agyemang,Kofi Acheampong,Louis Agyekum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN techniques for handling class imbalance in credit default prediction, finding that Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier achieved the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit default datasets are typically imbalanced with few defaulters, which affects machine learning model performance. The study aims to address this imbalance problem and find the most effective combination of techniques for credit default prediction.

Method: Used real-world credit data from Cleveland ML Repository, applied Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN outlier detection, compared traditional classifiers (Naive Bayes, KNN) with ensemble boosting algorithms (XGBoost, AdaBoost, GBM, Light GBM) using three resampling techniques (SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, ADASYN).

Result: The Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier achieved the best performance: F1-score 82.56%, G-mean 82.98%, ROC-AUC 90.90%, PR-AUC 91.85%.

Conclusion: The findings provide a foundation for developing more resilient credit default systems, which is essential as credit-based transactions continue to increase globally.

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and
F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the
Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models
(F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit
default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in
creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be
essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

*Andreas Lebedev,Abhinav Das,Sven Pappert,Stephan Schlüter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares uncertainty quantification methods in probabilistic forecasting models for electricity prices, finding that LEAR-based models perform well overall while DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, with conformal prediction best capturing uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most probabilistic forecasting models don't fully capture uncertainty from both data and model choices, which is crucial for energy risk management. The study aims to examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art models for electricity price forecasting.

Method: The study compares deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) with ensemble approaches, Monte Carlo dropout, and conformal prediction against LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) models with quantile regression averaging, GARCH, and conformal prediction for German electricity market forecasting.

Result: LEAR-based models performed well in probabilistic forecasting regardless of uncertainty method. DDNNs improved with both data and model uncertainty incorporation. Conformal prediction best captured uncertainty. All models were competitive but relative performance depended on chosen metrics.

Conclusion: All considered models perform competitively for electricity price forecasting, with LEAR models showing strong probabilistic forecasting capabilities and DDNNs benefiting from comprehensive uncertainty quantification. The choice between models depends on specific forecasting metrics and uncertainty requirements.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel methodology for verifying, evaluating, and risk-assessing deep learning systems by modeling distributional shifts at runtime using out-of-distribution detectors and binary tree structures to compute accurate performance estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor distributional shifts that are not accounted for in conventional evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics.

Method: Explicitly models incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from out-of-distribution detectors. Combines these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness in a binary tree structure, which is traversed to compute credible accuracy estimates.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation across five datasets, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. Successfully demonstrated on a medical segmentation benchmark for risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes.

Conclusion: Provides a robust framework for improving reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems in safety-critical applications through more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate
performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current benchmarking of cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) for foundation forecasting models is flawed due to small datasets, improper statistics, suboptimal models, and data leakage. The authors address these issues with a unified reimplementation, careful pre-training on proprietary/synthetic data, and evaluation on 15 large datasets, finding that statistical models outperform FFMs but synthetic pre-training improves FFMs by 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in current CFTL benchmarking practices, including reliance on small datasets, inadequate statistical treatment, suboptimal models, and data leakage risks.

Method: Introduced a unified reimplementation of neural forecasting networks adapted for CFTL, pre-trained only on proprietary and synthetic data while preventing test leakage, and evaluated on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets.

Result: Statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS and more than 20% in MASE across datasets. Synthetic dataset pre-training improves FFM accuracy by 7%.

Conclusion: Current CFTL benchmarking practices are inadequate, and while statistical models outperform FFMs, synthetic pre-training shows promise for improving FFMs, highlighting the need for better evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

*Javier Castro,Benjamin Gess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes THINNs, a thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs that uses fluctuation structure from large deviations principles to penalize improbable deviations rather than heuristic penalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs use heuristic penalization strategies that may not align with the physical fluctuation structure of non-equilibrium systems. The goal is to develop a physically informed penalization consistent with thermodynamic principles.

Method: Develops THINNs by incorporating large deviations principles to inform penalty terms, penalizing improbable deviations based on the system's fluctuation structure rather than arbitrary choices.

Result: Establishes analytical a posteriori estimates and provides empirical comparisons showing THINNs outperform established penalization strategies in thermodynamic consistency.

Conclusion: THINNs offer a physically grounded alternative to heuristic PINN penalization, with demonstrated theoretical and empirical advantages for modeling non-equilibrium fluctuating systems.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

### [42] [Transformer Modeling for Both Scalability and Performance in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19471)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTAformer is a transformer model for multivariate time series that uses delegate tokens to constrain inter-variable mixing, achieving linear scaling with variable count while improving performance over standard transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers face scalability issues with variable count in multivariate time series and suffer from noise accumulation due to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing, especially problematic in sparse signal environments.

Method: Proposes delegate tokens that act as implicit regularizers to selectively constrain inter-variable modeling while allowing full inter-temporal modeling, forcing the model to be selective about what inter-variable information propagates.

Result: DELTAformer scales linearly with variable count while outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks with superior noise-resilience in noisy MTS environments.

Conclusion: By strategically constraining inter-variable mixing through delegate tokens, DELTAformer simultaneously improves both scalability and performance, demonstrating that domain-specific design can overcome traditional trade-offs in transformer modeling.

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A refined MILP formulation for counterfactual explanations that reduces computational constraints while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plausible counterfactual explanation methods have high computational costs due to numerous constraints in their optimization models.

Method: Revisited DACE framework with a refined Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation that reduces constraints in the local outlier factor objective, applied to linear SVM classifier with standard scaler.

Result: Experimental results show faster solving times while maintaining explanation quality.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates promise for more efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

*Mohan Guo,Cong Liu,Patrick Forré*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A frame-based diffusion paradigm for molecular generation that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone architecture, with three variants (GFD, LFD, IFD) and EdgeDiT transformer for enhanced expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between strict equivariance (with costly architectures) and relaxed equivariance (for scalability) in molecular generation methods, seeking a solution that maintains physical grounding while being scalable and flexible.

Method: Proposes frame-based diffusion with three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD) with shared molecular frame, Local Frame Diffusion (LFD) with node-specific frames and alignment constraints, and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD) with pre-canonicalized invariant representations. Uses EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention for enhanced expressivity.

Result: On QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance: test NLL of -137.97 (standard scale) and -141.85 (double scale), atom stability of 98.98%, molecular stability of 90.51%. Surpasses all equivariant baselines with high validity/uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM.

Conclusion: Frame-based diffusion establishes a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation in achieving both equivariance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

*Ali Baheri,Lars Lindemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCFM learns dissipative dynamics while preserving first principles, avoiding energy injection and ensuring stable long-horizon rollouts through a conservative-dissipative split and structure-preserving sampler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates often inject energy and destabilize long-horizon rollouts. MCFM aims to build the conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure preserving sampler to avoid these issues.

Method: MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted energy is available.

Result: On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Conclusion: MCFM provides continuous and discrete time guarantees linking its parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts, effectively learning dissipative dynamics without violating first principles.

*Zongyue Li,Xiao Han,Yusong Li,Niklas Strauss,Matthias Schubert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAWM is a diffusion-based world model that generates state-reward trajectories conditioned on current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model for action inference, enabling efficient offline RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based world models often don't generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step TD learning. Joint modeling approaches increase complexity and reduce performance.

Method: Proposes DAWM with modular design: diffusion model generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on current state, action, and return-to-go, while an inverse dynamics model handles action inference separately.

Result: Conservative offline RL algorithms (TD3BC, IQL) benefit significantly from training on DAWM's augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple D4RL benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: The modular design of DAWM produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training while maintaining compatibility with standard offline RL algorithms.

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a force analysis-inspired framework to understand how deep learning models learn over time by examining how training examples influence each other during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand deep learning model behaviors by analyzing the interactions between training examples during the learning process, similar to how forces affect objects in physics.

Method: The approach breaks down training example influence into two components: similarity between examples and the strength of updating forces. This framework is applied to various learning tasks to analyze model behaviors.

Result: The framework explains non-trivial learning paths of certain examples, the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of LLM finetuning methods, and why simpler structured patterns are learned more easily. It also uncovers new strategies for improving model training.

Conclusion: While still developing, this force analysis-inspired approach offers a systematic way to interpret model behaviors and provides insights for enhancing training methodologies.

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

### [49] [Modular Machine Learning with Applications to Genetic Circuit Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19601)
*Jichi Wang,Eduardo D. Sontag,Domitilla Del Vecchio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular learning framework that uses compositional structure knowledge to identify module functions from system data with reduced training requirements, enabling better generalization than structure-agnostic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In systems with many modules (like synthetic biology), input/output functions are often unknown, but knowledge of composition architecture can reduce training data needs and enable new system designs.

Method: Introduces modular identifiability concept and theoretical guarantees for recovering module functions from subset data. Uses neural networks that incorporate compositional structure.

Result: Structure-aware neural networks successfully learn module functions and generalize to out-of-distribution inputs, while structure-agnostic networks fail to predict outside training distribution.

Conclusion: The framework reduces experimental data requirements and enables module identification, facilitating synthetic biological circuit design and multi-module systems engineering.

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

### [50] [Improved Therapeutic Antibody Reformatting through Multimodal Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19604)
*Jiayi Xin,Aniruddh Raghu,Nick Bhattacharya,Adam Carr,Melanie Montgomery,Hunter Elliott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework to predict antibody reformatting success by combining sequence and structural information, outperforming large protein language models in challenging real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex multi-domain antibody formats present engineering challenges where individual domain functions and stability aren't guaranteed in novel formats, requiring better prediction methods for reformatting success.

Method: Developed a multimodal machine learning framework incorporating both antibody sequence and structural context, with evaluation protocols reflecting realistic deployment scenarios.

Result: Large pretrained protein language models failed to outperform simple domain-tailored multimodal representations, especially in the most challenging 'new antibody, no data' scenario where the multimodal model achieved high predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The multimodal framework enables effective prioritization of promising antibody reformatting candidates and reduces wasted experimental effort, demonstrating superior performance over PLMs in practical applications.

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

### [51] [Adaptive von Mises-Fisher Likelihood Loss for Supervised Deep Time Series Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19625)
*Juan Manuel Perez,Kevin Garcia,Brooklyn Berry,Dongjin Song,Yifeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a von Mises-Fisher hashing loss for deep hashing that maps data to hyperspherical space to reduce information loss during binary discretization, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep hashing methods for time series indexing suffer from significant information loss during the discretization step when converting real-valued representations to binary codes.

Method: Maps data to M-dimensional hyperspherical space and models each data class as points following distinct von Mises-Fisher distributions, maximizing separation between distributions to improve margin between semantically different samples.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline methods for time series indexing.

Conclusion: The von Mises-Fisher hashing loss provides an effective approach for deep hashing that reduces information loss and improves performance in time series indexing tasks.

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at

### [52] [Mamba Modulation: On the Length Generalization of Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19633)
*Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Qiuhao Zeng,Xinyu Wang,Boxing Wang,Philippe Langlais,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba state-space models show poor performance on contexts longer than pre-training due to out-of-distribution behavior in state-space dynamics. The paper attributes this to state convergence behavior linked to the spectrum of transition matrix A, and proposes spectrum scaling to enable robust long-context generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba achieves state-of-the-art results but significantly deteriorates on longer contexts than seen during pre-training, revealing sensitivity to context length extension that limits its practical application.

Method: The paper analyzes the root cause (state convergence behavior related to transition matrix spectrum) and proposes spectrum scaling to selectively modulate the spectrum of A matrices in pre-trained Mamba models for better length generalization.

Result: Spectrum scaling significantly improves performance in long-context settings where previous approaches (modulating discretization time steps) fail, validating the connection between state convergence and transition matrix spectrum.

Conclusion: The work provides a well-founded explanation for Mamba's length sensitivity and offers an effective solution through spectrum scaling, enabling better length generalization for state-space models with structured transition matrices.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

*MohammadReza EskandariNasab,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIMED is a unified generative framework for high-quality synthetic time series generation that combines diffusion models, supervisor networks, and adversarial training with MMD loss to capture both marginal distributions and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic time series data is challenging due to the need to model both marginal distributions and complex temporal dependencies, especially when real data is scarce, noisy, or expensive to collect.

Method: TIMED integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for global structure, a supervisor network with teacher forcing for autoregressive dependencies, a Wasserstein critic for temporal smoothness, and MMD loss for feature space alignment - all built with masked attention architectures.

Result: Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks show TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: TIMED provides an effective unified framework that successfully captures both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data, outperforming existing methods in generating high-quality synthetic sequences.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

TL;DR: A novel Spatial Structured Attention Block for global station weather forecasting that models both local and global spatial correlations through intra-subgraph and inter-subgraph attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation, which contradicts the intrinsic nature of global weather systems and limits forecast performance.

Method: Proposes a Spatial Structured Attention Block that partitions spatial graphs into subgraphs, uses Intra-subgraph Attention for local spatial correlation, and Inter-subgraph Attention for global message passing. Builds a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales.

Result: Achieves performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.

Conclusion: The proposed model is scalable, produces structured spatial correlation, easy to implement, and significantly outperforms existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series data in digital health is highly noisy, involves concept drifting, and poses challenges for training generalizable deep learning models, particularly due to data distribution shifts from different human behaviors.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised learning framework that incorporates bag-of-symbol representation, which is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise in time series data.

Result: The proposed method achieves significantly better performance in scenarios where significant data shifting exists.

Conclusion: The bag-of-symbol representation is effective in guiding deep learning to acquire representations resistant to data shifting in digital health time series analysis.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

TL;DR: A wavelet expansion method for distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) that prevents probability mass misplacement in numerical data by prioritizing low-order coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP methods for categorical data don't transfer well to numerical data due to different evaluation metrics, particularly the need to prevent probability mass from being misplaced far away from ground truth.

Method: Express sample distribution using wavelet expansions and estimate coefficients under LDP, prioritizing low-order coefficients to ensure accurate macroscopic estimation and prevent far misplacement of probability mass.

Result: Theoretical guarantees established. Experiments show significant outperformance over existing solutions under Wasserstein and KS distances.

Conclusion: Wavelet expansion method effectively addresses numerical data distribution estimation under LDP by focusing on macroscopic accuracy through prioritized low-order coefficient estimation.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein

*Andrew Wang,Jiashuo Zhang,Michael Oberst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CXR models perform best on cases with low pre-test probability but worse on clinically relevant cases with higher pre-test probability, and their apparent diagnostic power may derive from inferring clinical context rather than true diagnostic signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong average-case performance of ML models on CXR datasets is insufficient to certify clinical utility, requiring more holistic evaluation using clinical context.

Method: Using discharge summaries prior to each CXR to derive pre-test probability of each label as proxy for clinical context, then evaluating model performance across different pre-test probability levels and on balanced test sets.

Result: Models perform best on low pre-test probability cases and worse on higher probability cases; performance drops sharply on balanced test sets where clinical context shortcut is removed.

Conclusion: Analysis using clinical context from notes is promising for more rigorous evaluation of clinical vision models, as current models may rely on inferring context rather than true diagnostic signal.

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C²Prompt addresses class-wise knowledge coherence issues in prompt-based federated continual learning by introducing local class distribution compensation and class-aware prompt aggregation to reduce intra-class distribution gaps and inter-class knowledge confusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based FCL methods suffer from class-wise knowledge coherence problems including intra-class distribution gaps across clients and inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which exacerbate spatial and temporal forgetting during prompt communication.

Method: Proposes Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C²Prompt) with two components: Local Class Distribution Compensation (LCDC) to reduce intra-class distribution disparities, and Class-aware Prompt Aggregation (CPA) to selectively strengthen class-relevant knowledge aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C²Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed C²Prompt method effectively enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication, mitigating both spatial and temporal forgetting in federated continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning with Adam optimizer, finding single indicators unreliable and proposing a dual-criteria threshold with a per-layer scheduler to maintain trainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loss of trainability occurs when gradient steps stop improving performance despite adequate capacity and supervision, which the authors aim to predict and prevent.

Method: Introduces two complementary criteria: batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and curvature volatility-controlled bound, combined into a per-layer predictive threshold. Uses this to build a per-layer scheduler that keeps effective steps below safe limits.

Result: The proposed method stabilizes training and improves accuracy across various techniques (CReLU, Wasserstein regularization, L2 weight decay) with learned learning-rate trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Conclusion: Single indicators are unreliable predictors of trainability loss; the dual-criteria threshold with per-layer scheduling effectively anticipates and prevents loss of trainability in continual learning with Adam.

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

### [60] [Linear Transformers Implicitly Discover Unified Numerical Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19702)
*Patrick Lutz,Aditya Gangrade,Hadi Daneshmand,Venkatesh Saligrama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A linear attention transformer trained on masked-block matrix completion tasks implicitly discovers a unified iterative solver that works across different computational regimes without explicit guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether transformers can autonomously discover efficient computational algorithms through in-context learning on matrix completion tasks, without being explicitly taught the underlying mathematical principles.

Method: Train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks where prompts are masked low-rank matrices with missing blocks that could be scalar prediction targets or unseen kernel slices for Nyström extrapolation, using only input-output pairs and mean-squared loss.

Result: The trained transformer implicitly discovers a parameter-free update rule that works across three computational regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, distributed computation), achieving second-order convergence on full-batch problems and reducing distributed iteration complexity.

Conclusion: Transformers trained solely to patch missing blocks can autonomously discover unified, resource-adaptive iterative solvers, demonstrating powerful in-context learning capabilities that span prediction, estimation, and Nyström extrapolation.

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-MultiTask is a multi-task meta-learning framework for estimating individualized treatment effects in surgical decision-making, incorporating inverse probability weighting for causal validity and achieving superior performance on spinal fusion and scoliosis datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical decision-making requires understanding causal relationships but current statistical methods struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Accurate individualized treatment effect estimation is crucial for high-stakes procedures like spinal fusion and scoliosis correction.

Method: Developed a multi-task meta-learning framework that models each surgical decision as a distinct task while learning shared representations across tasks. Incorporated inverse probability weighting into the training objective to strengthen causal validity.

Result: Achieved highest average AUC (0.84) in anterior group and competitive performance in posterior group (0.77). Outperformed baselines with lowest overall ε_NN-PEHE (0.2778) and ε_ATE (0.0763) on spinal fusion data, and superior performance on AIS dataset with ε_NN-PEHE = 0.2551 and ε_ATE = 0.0902.

Conclusion: X-MultiTask provides robust, patient-specific causal estimates that can advance personalized surgical care and improve patient outcomes, offering a powerful tool for surgical decision-making.

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address extrapolation error in off-policy RL by drawing an analogy with static friction in classical mechanics, preventing policy drift toward unsupported actions.

Method: Extends batch-constrained RL by constraining the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to the replay buffer while maintaining distance from the orthonormal action space manifold.

Result: The algorithm is robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: The constraint preserves batch-constrained simplicity while providing intuitive physical interpretation of extrapolation error, making the approach effective for continuous control tasks.

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work provides the first rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding why Sobolev training works, demonstrating its acceleration benefits for ReLU networks through improved loss landscape conditioning, with practical implications for modern deep learning applications.

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss

improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep

*Xiaocheng Fang,Jiarui Jin,Haoyu Wang,Che Liu,Jieyi Cai,Guangkun Nie,Jun Li,Hongyan Li,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPGFlowECG is a two-stage framework that translates PPG signals into clinically valuable ECG signals using latent space alignment and rectified flow, enabling accessible cardiovascular disease detection from wearable devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG is the gold standard for cardiac monitoring but requires specialized equipment, while PPG is accessible through wearables but lacks definitive diagnostic information. There's a need to bridge this gap by generating ECG from PPG for continuous monitoring.

Method: Proposes PPGFlowECG with CardioAlign Encoder to align PPG and ECG in shared latent space, followed by latent rectified flow for high-fidelity ECG generation. Validated on MCMED dataset with 10M+ paired samples from 118K+ emergency visits.

Result: Method effectively translates PPG to ECG and enables cardiovascular disease detection. Cardiologist evaluations confirm high fidelity and improved diagnostic reliability of synthesized ECGs.

Conclusion: PPGFlowECG shows strong potential for real-world cardiovascular screening by making ECG-quality monitoring accessible through wearable PPG devices.

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world
cardiovascular screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tanbr is a tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router that enables efficient online MoE inference by estimating task distributions and guiding expert merging without explicit task tags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Sparse Mixture of Experts for online inference is challenging due to large model size, complex expert routing, and lack of task information in edge networks.

Method: Uses historical data to estimate task distribution, employs binary tree to partition merging weight space, and applies neural bandit to learn non-linear mapping from merging weights to model performance for optimal expert merging.

Result: Achieves sublinear regret bound O(√T log(T)), reduces inference latency by at least 45% and memory usage by up to 25% while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Tanbr provides an effective solution for efficient and reliable online MoE inference in resource-constrained environments without requiring explicit task information.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

*Carlo Bosio,Greg Woelki,Noureldin Hendy,Nicholas Roy,Byungsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDAR is a method to learn per-agent relevance in autonomous driving by identifying which agents can be excluded from input to a pre-trained behavior model, achieving comparable performance while processing fewer agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human drivers focus on only a few relevant agents at a time, while current autonomous systems process all agents regardless of relevance, leading to computational inefficiency. Existing attention mechanisms are quadratic and expensive.

Method: Formulate agent masking as a Markov Decision Process where actions are binary masks indicating agent selection. Learn per-agent relevance by identifying which agents can be excluded without affecting driving behavior.

Result: RDAR achieves comparable driving performance (progress, safety, performance) to state-of-the-art behavior models while processing significantly fewer agents on large-scale driving datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed RDAR method successfully learns accurate numerical measures of agent relevance, enabling more efficient autonomous driving systems that mimic human-like selective attention.

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

*Guochao Jiang,Wenfeng Feng,Guofeng Quan,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Guohua Liu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCRL is a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically adjusts training sample difficulty based on reward variance, addressing limitations of existing rollout-based RL methods for LLMs in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rollout-based RL methods for LLMs fail to consider different difficulty levels of samples, which contradicts the natural human learning process of progressing from easy to difficult tasks in mathematical reasoning.

Method: VCRL uses the variance of rollout group rewards as an indicator of sample difficulty (easy/hard samples have low variance, moderate difficulty samples have high variance) and dynamically controls training sample difficulty based on this variance metric.

Result: Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks with two models show that VCRL outperforms current LLM reinforcement learning baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed VCRL framework successfully incorporates curriculum learning principles into reinforcement learning for LLMs, demonstrating improved performance on mathematical reasoning tasks by adapting to appropriate difficulty levels during training.

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

TL;DR: CSF is a novel score-based filtering algorithm that uses a set-transformer encoder and conditional diffusion model to enable efficient posterior sampling without retraining, achieving superior performance in high-dimensional nonlinear filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional nonlinear filtering remains challenging, and existing score-based diffusion methods require impractical repeated retraining for evolving priors.

Method: CSF decouples prior modeling and posterior sampling into offline/online stages using a set-transformer encoder and conditional diffusion model, eliminating the need for retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments show CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Conclusion: CSF provides a scalable and practical solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering by enabling efficient posterior sampling without retraining requirements.

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear
filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based
diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) using B-splines, proving they achieve minimax-optimal convergence rates for Sobolev space functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a solid theoretical foundation for KANs as a structured and interpretable alternative to existing methods in multivariate function approximation.

Method: Theoretical analysis of KANs with B-spline representations, proving convergence rates for both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative architectures, along with guidelines for optimal knot selection.

Result: Proved that KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)}) for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness r, with simulation studies confirming the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: KANs provide a theoretically sound framework for nonparametric regression with optimal convergence properties, making them a promising structured alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

TL;DR: BoreaRL is a new multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for boreal forest management that simulates carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation trade-offs, revealing significant learning challenges for current MORL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, but current tools cannot adequately address the complex trade-offs between carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation.

Method: Developed BoreaRL, a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes, supporting two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity.

Result: Carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw objectives, with standard preference-conditioned approaches failing in generalist settings. A naive curriculum learning approach achieved superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes.

Conclusion: Robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches in multi-objective RL for climate applications.

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

*Henrik Voigt,Paul Kahlmeyer,Kai Lawonn,Michael Habeck,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based symbolic regression models show strong in-distribution performance but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, limiting their practical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained transformer models for symbolic regression beyond their training data distribution.

Method: Conducted empirical study testing state-of-the-art transformer-based symbolic regression approaches on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Result: Significant performance degradation observed in out-of-distribution settings despite strong in-distribution performance, revealing a critical generalization gap.

Conclusion: The generalization gap poses a major barrier for practical application of pre-trained symbolic regression models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to differentiate boundary-critical vs core-redundant data in imbalanced classification, improving F1 scores by up to 10% and enabling 90% dataset compression while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models struggle with imbalanced classification due to inability to distinguish critical boundary instances from redundant core samples, leading to inefficient training and poor performance.

Method: Proposes boundary data oversampling and core-aware reduction methods to systematically identify and differentiate between boundary-critical and core-redundant data points.

Result: Boundary oversampling improves F1 score by up to 10% on 96% of datasets; core-aware reduction compresses datasets up to 90% while preserving accuracy, making it 10x more powerful than original data.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient model training, extends to text/multimodal/self-supervised learning, and paves way for data-efficient learning where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force
expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is

*Shi Yin,Zujian Dai,Xinyang Pan,Lixin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NextHAM is a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction, achieving excellent accuracy and efficiency on a new large benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for Hamiltonian prediction face challenges in generalization due to diverse atomic types, structural patterns, and high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians. Traditional DFT methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes NextHAM with three key innovations: 1) zeroth-step Hamiltonians as informative descriptors and initial estimates, 2) neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-symmetry, 3) novel training objective ensuring accuracy in both real and reciprocal space. Also introduces Materials-HAM-SOC dataset with 17,000 material structures.

Result: Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures, preventing error amplification and ghost states.

Conclusion: NextHAM advances universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction through methodological innovations and a comprehensive benchmark dataset, offering significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has
offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT
methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the
high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the
generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology
and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian
prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and
expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials
electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

*Lorenzo Perini,Daniel Haimovich,Fridolin Linder,Niek Tax,Dima Karamshuk,Milan Vojnovic,Nastaran Okati,Pavlos Athanasios Apostolopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGrad is a novel multicalibration algorithm that addresses limitations of existing methods by not requiring manual subgroup specification, being scalable, and improving rather than harming other ML performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multicalibration methods have limited industry adoption due to requiring manual subgroup specification, lack of scalability, and potential negative impact on other model performance metrics like log loss and PRAUC.

Method: MCGrad is a scalable multicalibration algorithm that automatically identifies calibration subgroups without requiring explicit specification of protected groups, making it practical for industrial deployment.

Result: MCGrad has been successfully deployed in production at Meta and is now part of hundreds of production models, showing improvements in ML evaluation metrics while achieving multicalibration.

Conclusion: MCGrad represents a practical and scalable solution for multicalibration that overcomes key limitations of previous methods, enabling widespread adoption in industrial ML systems.

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

TL;DR: A Bi-Axial Transformer foundation model for critical care time series that outperforms supervised baselines in mortality prediction, especially for small datasets under 5,000 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare are expanding, but critical care time series models remain underexplored due to limited dataset size and availability.

Method: Early-stage pre-trained foundation model based on Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT) trained on pooled electronic health record datasets, with transfer learning via fine-tuning on distinct datasets.

Result: Outperforms supervised baselines for mortality prediction, particularly effective for small datasets (<5,000 samples).

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care time series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in
recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain
relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on
pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer
learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series
to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited
settings.

### [77] [PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894)
*Xueliang Zhao,Wei Wu,Jian Guan,Zhuocheng Gong,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0 is a scalable framework that uses expectation-maximization to iteratively refine rationales for generating harder and more diverse reasoning problems, enabling both self-play improvement and supervised fine-tuning of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training faces a bottleneck in high-quality reasoning problems - human-curated datasets are limited and costly, while synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow.

Method: An expectation-maximization loop that iteratively refines rationales to guide prompt construction, producing more challenging and diverse problems than prior approaches.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results: +4.4-6.1 points on various benchmarks, +35 Elo on Codeforces for 30B models, and boosted smaller models (7B) to 53.4-73.1 accuracy on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Prompt synthesis establishes a new axis for scaling reasoning capabilities, with PromptCoT 2.0 serving as a scalable foundation for future open-source models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

### [78] [Pure Exploration via Frank-Wolfe Self-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19901)
*Xinyu Liu,Chao Qin,Wei You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP), a projection-free, regularization-free method for pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, addressing challenges like nonunique optima and nonsmoothness through differential-inclusion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from finite alternatives in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, overcoming pathological challenges like nonunique optima and boundary nonsmoothness that complicate algorithm design.

Method: Reformulates the maximin optimization as a concave-convex saddle-point problem using mixed strategies, develops FWSP with one-hot updates matching bandit sampling, and employs differential-inclusion arguments with Lyapunov analysis for convergence proofs.

Result: Proves convergence of game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits, demonstrates vanishing duality gap through numerical experiments, and extends to a posterior sampling-based learning algorithm.

Conclusion: FWSP provides a theoretically grounded, practical approach for structured bandit exploration with guaranteed convergence despite structural pathologies, validated by empirical results showing vanishing duality gap.

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits,
aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of
alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a
maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation
between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements
to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We
reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy,
yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to
Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free,
tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit
sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies
that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study
exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm,
bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these
challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the
game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds
through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov
function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and
convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires
differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we
show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from
pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the
optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed
flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we
further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

*Songtao Li,Zhenyu Liao,Tianqi Hou,Ting Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIRF introduces a novel approach for few-shot generation by reframing it as progressive densification of geometrically structured manifolds, using a manifold-preserving latent space and iterative generate-correct-augment cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot generation methods suffer from overfitting, mode collapse, and inherit biases from large models while neglecting the geometric structure of latent space.

Method: LIRF establishes a stable latent space using autoencoder with manifold-preservation loss, then uses iterative generate-correct-augment cycles with geometric correction operators that are provably contractive mappings.

Result: The method demonstrates predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated and true data manifold, scalability to high-resolution images (AFHQ-Cat), and effectiveness through ablation studies.

Conclusion: LIRF provides a theoretically grounded and highly effective solution for data-scarce generative modeling that overcomes limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from
limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling.
Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and
mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting
the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these
limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel
approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of
geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using
an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss}
$L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the
geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we
propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle,
candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a
provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while
preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem}
demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated
and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by
generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies
confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive
correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF
provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only
theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

*Balazs Pejo,Marcell Frank,Krisztian Varga,Peter Veliczky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, showing how both architectural choices (aggregation methods) and intentional manipulation (poisoning attacks) can significantly distort fairness scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in federated learning's contribution evaluation mechanisms, which are critical for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation but may be unreliable.

Method: The study conducts extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures using the Flower framework, examining how different aggregation methods and poisoning attacks affect contribution scores.

Result: Both the choice of aggregation method and presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, with advanced aggregation techniques and strategic model update manipulation significantly altering fairness evaluations.

Conclusion: Current contribution evaluation schemes in federated learning are fragile and require more robust approaches to ensure reliable fairness assessment and participant incentivization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models (LLMs/VLMs) show potential for zero-shot exploration in RL but suffer from a "knowing-doing gap" where they understand objectives but fail at precise control. A hybrid framework demonstrates VLM guidance can improve early-stage sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities of foundation models as zero-shot exploration agents in RL, particularly in sparse-reward settings where exploration is challenging.

Method: Benchmarking LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari games, then investigating a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled best-case scenario.

Result: VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input but consistently fail at precise low-level control. In the hybrid framework, VLM guidance significantly improves early-stage sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Foundation models are better suited for guiding exploration rather than end-to-end control, with clear potential and constraints identified for using them in RL exploration.

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly
in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic
priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL
benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed
bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our
investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level
objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level
control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,
we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case
scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can
significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis
of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide
exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

TL;DR: This paper presents two prompting methods for detecting Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts using large language models, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ADReSS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop training-free methods for Alzheimer's disease detection from speech transcripts using prompting techniques with large language models, improving interpretability by anchoring probabilities to MMSE scores.

Method: Two prompting variants: (1) MMSE-Proxy Prompting with class-balanced few-shot examples carrying MMSE-anchored probabilities, and (2) Reasoning-augmented Prompting using multimodal LLM (GPT-5) to generate reasoning-enhanced examples from Cookie Theft image, transcript, and MMSE data.

Result: MMSE-Proxy Prompting achieved 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC; Reasoning-augmented Prompting achieved 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC, both representing state-of-the-art prompting results on ADReSS dataset.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective zero-shot and few-shot prompting approaches for Alzheimer's detection, with novel contributions in MMSE-anchored probability elicitation and multimodal construction for improved interpretability.

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting
Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we
revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced
protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20
examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art
prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a
probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic
mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii)
Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a
multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript,
and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains
transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this
is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use
multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TABFAIRGDT is a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees with soft leaf resampling to mitigate bias while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often inherit biases from training data, and while generative models show promise for bias mitigation, existing approaches rely on deep architectures despite simpler models being effective for tabular data.

Method: Uses autoregressive decision trees with a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while maintaining predictive performance. The approach is non-parametric and handles mixed feature types without distributional assumptions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep generative models on benchmark fairness datasets, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off and higher synthetic data quality. Achieves 72% average speedup over fastest baseline and can generate fair data for medium-sized datasets in one second on standard CPU.

Conclusion: TABFAIRGDT provides an efficient, lightweight, and CPU-compatible solution for fair synthetic data generation, making it ideal for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as
models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have
recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level
while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite
evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this
work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic
tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we
propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to
reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is
non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed
feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data
distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,
achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as
higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly
efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,
TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across
various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized
datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,
making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: DACL is a hybrid framework combining diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning for robust biosignal representation learning, using diffusion forward process as principled data augmentation and achieving competitive performance on ECG classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation methods fail to capture complex variations in physiological data, necessitating more effective approaches for learning robust biosignal representations.

Method: Uses a lightweight VAE trained on Scattering Transformer features to create latent space, applies diffusion forward process as data augmentation to generate noisy views, and trains a U-Net encoder with supervised contrastive objective for noise-invariant embeddings.

Result: Achieved competitive AUROC of 0.7815 on PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, demonstrating effective class separability.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using diffusion process to drive contrastive objective, creating robust noise-invariant embeddings for biosignal analysis.

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

TL;DR: RaNNDy is a randomized neural network approach for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data, using random hidden layer weights and only training the output layer to achieve faster training with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient method for learning transfer operators that reduces training time and resources while avoiding common deep learning issues like hyperparameter sensitivity and slow convergence.

Method: Randomly select weights for hidden layers and only train the output layer, enabling closed-form solution for output weights that represent eigenfunctions, with uncertainty estimation via ensemble learning.

Result: The approach significantly reduces training time without noticeable accuracy reduction, successfully applied to various operators including Koopman, Perron-Frobenius, and Schrödinger operators across stochastic systems, protein folding, and quantum oscillators.

Conclusion: RaNNDy provides an efficient framework for spectral analysis of transfer operators with faster training and uncertainty quantification, though the paper also acknowledges some weaknesses in the approach.

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning
transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of
the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the
output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable
reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time
and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such
as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the
proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output
layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover,
it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral
properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical
operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have
important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the
strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several
stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum
harmonic oscillator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-Filter is a novel filtering framework that uses large language models for state estimation in dynamical systems by embedding observations with text prototypes, achieving superior performance and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal filtering (estimating hidden states in dynamical systems) is a fundamental problem across science and engineering. The authors aim to leverage the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs to improve state estimation tasks.

Method: The framework uses System-as-Prompt (SaP) design to incorporate task instructions, enabling LLMs to understand estimation tasks. It achieves modality alignment with frozen LLMs and embeds noisy observations with text prototypes.

Result: LLM-Filter outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based approaches, exhibits exceptional generalization in changed or unseen environments, and shows scaling-law behavior where accuracy improves with larger models and longer training.

Conclusion: LLM-Filter demonstrates that LLMs can significantly benefit state estimation tasks and serves as a promising foundation model for filtering applications.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal
filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and
engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework,
\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state
estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various
experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state
estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in
pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,
LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,
we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating
task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.
Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,
capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen
environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where
accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These
findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

### [87] [Learnable Sampler Distillation for Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19962)
*Feiyang Fu,Tongxian Guo,Zhaoqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes learnable sampler distillation (LSD) to accelerate discrete diffusion models by training student samplers to match teacher trajectories with adaptive coefficients and non-uniform time scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models suffer from inefficient sampling requiring many steps, and acceleration methods using larger step sizes degrade generation quality due to compounding decoding and discretization errors.

Method: LSD uses distillation where a student sampler with few steps learns to align its score trajectory with a high-quality teacher sampler through learnable coefficients. LSD+ adds learnable non-uniform time schedules.

Result: Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks show LSD outperforms existing samplers, achieving higher quality with significantly fewer sampling steps.

Conclusion: The proposed LSD approach enables efficient high-quality sampling for discrete diffusion models through learnable distillation and adaptive scheduling.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for
discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical
application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of
sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically
introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the
impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and
discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant
decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable
sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity
samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler
with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of
a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved
by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling
dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time
schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text
generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed
approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially
higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is

### [88] [Discovering Association Rules in High-Dimensional Small Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20113)
*Erkan Karabulut,Daniel Daza,Paul Groth,Victoria Degeler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses association rule mining (ARM) in high-dimensional tabular data, particularly focusing on scalability and low-data regimes. It improves upon Aerial+ by introducing fine-tuning approaches using tabular foundation models to handle high-dimensional, low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Association Rule Mining faces challenges with rule explosion and computational overhead in high-dimensional settings. While neurosymbolic methods like Aerial+ address dimensionality issues, they suffer from reduced performance in low-data regimes, which is problematic for domains like biomedicine with thousands of features but few samples.

Method: The paper proposes two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular foundation models. These approaches are designed to enhance rule quality in high-dimensional, low-data scenarios by leveraging pre-trained foundation models adapted for tabular data.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve rule quality on five real-world datasets. Aerial+ is shown to scale one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and neurosymbolic baselines across these datasets.

Conclusion: The fine-tuning approaches effectively address ARM challenges in high-dimensional, low-data settings, demonstrating practical applicability for domains like biomedicine where datasets have thousands of features but limited samples.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in
datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge
discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making.
However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational
overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective
search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks.
Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address
the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the
data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced
performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in
high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales
one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and
neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce
the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene
expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50
samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular
foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve
rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

*Xilin Dai,Zhijian Xu,Wanxu Cai,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm replaces sampling-based forecasting with direct generation of scenario-probability pairs, achieving SOTA results with TimePrism model


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sampling-based probabilistic forecasting has limitations: lacks explicit probabilities, poor coverage, and high computational costs

Method: TimePrism model with three parallel linear layers that directly produces finite set of {Scenario, Probability} pairs instead of using Monte Carlo sampling

Result: Achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics

Conclusion: Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm shows strong potential for forecasting beyond traditional sampling methods, representing a fundamental reframing of learning objectives

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on
sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from
inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate
coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address
the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of
\{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation.
To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model
composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves
9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two
metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing
of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability
space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and
corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the
Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in
forecasting beyond sampling.

### [90] [An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20184)
*Tiejun Wang,Rui Wang,Xudong Mou,Mengyuan Ma,Tianyu Wo,Renyu Yang,Xudong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StrAD is a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach that incorporates structural information into reconstruction-based methods to better detect both point-wise and pattern-wise anomalies in time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods rely solely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring structural characteristics of time series and failing to detect complex pattern-wise anomalies effectively.

Method: StrAD enriches the optimization objective by incorporating trend, seasonality, and shape information to learn latent structural characteristics. It ensures alignment between original and reconstructed data in terms of structural features through a pluggable mechanism applicable to any reconstruction-based method.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware optimization mechanism enhances model sensitivity to both point-wise and pattern-wise anomalies, making it a valuable enhancement for reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods.

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

### [91] [Faster Than SVD, Smarter Than SGD: The OPLoRA Alternating Update](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19977)
*Abdulla Jasem Almansoori,Maria Ivanova,Andrey Veprikov,Aleksandr Beznosikov,Samuel Horváth,Martin Takáč*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPLoRA is a memory-efficient optimizer that improves LoRA fine-tuning by using alternating least squares updates to closely match full training performance with low-rank projections, while maintaining the same memory budget as Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a performance gap between full training with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA optimization can be further improved to achieve better performance without increasing memory requirements.

Method: OPLoRA casts LoRA optimization as an interpretable sub-problem and solves it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, requiring only 1-2 alternating steps to closely match truncated SVD performance. It also supports momentum through a low-rank estimate using LoRSum subroutine.

Result: Across linear tasks, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches SVDLoRA's performance while using significantly less memory than traditional approaches.

Conclusion: OPLoRA effectively closes the performance gap between full training and LoRA fine-tuning, providing a memory-efficient optimization method that maintains the parameter efficiency of LoRA while achieving near-SVDLoRA performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank
updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters
and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank
projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be
further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient
optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable
sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates,
where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely
match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the
recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA
supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine
(LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of
LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled
variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear
task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches
SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

*Deokjae Lee,Hyun Oh Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-Palette introduces a novel weight-only post-training quantization framework for LLMs using fractional-bit quantizers and mixed-scheme optimization to achieve near-optimal performance with minimal calibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight-only PTQ is essential for reducing LLM memory footprint and latency in edge scenarios, but irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers complicate quantization. Rotation-based methods transform weights to near-Gaussian distributions, but optimal bit allocation requires fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers.

Method: Proposes Q-Palette - a collection of fractional-bit quantizers including trellis-coded, vector, and scalar quantizers with optimized CUDA kernels. Introduces mixed-scheme quantization framework that jointly optimizes quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions under resource constraints.

Result: The method achieves near-optimal quantization performance by approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound, with efficient implementation across various bitwidths suitable for memory-bound inference scenarios.

Conclusion: Q-Palette provides a practical solution bridging theoretical optimal bit allocation with efficient implementation, enabling effective weight-only quantization for LLMs on edge devices with minimal calibration requirements.

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the
weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no
calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint
and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference
scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its
importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs
complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that
transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with
fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first
derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized
weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit
quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to
achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical
insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile
collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded
quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar
quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with
optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging
Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme
quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion
decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at

*Haolin Li,Tianjie Dai,Zhe Chen,Siyuan Du,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAD is a retrieval-augmented framework that explicitly injects external medical knowledge into multimodal models for clinical diagnosis, outperforming current approaches by better aligning with clinical workflows and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI medical approaches rely on implicitly encoded knowledge, neglecting task-specific knowledge needed for diverse downstream diagnostic tasks. There's a need for explicit knowledge injection that aligns with clinical diagnostic workflows.

Method: Three key mechanisms: 1) Retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from multiple medical sources, 2) Guideline-enhanced contrastive loss to constrain latent distance between multimodal features and guideline knowledge, 3) Dual transformer decoder using guidelines as queries to steer cross-modal fusion.

Result: Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and generalizability. RAD enables more precise focus on abnormal regions and critical indicators for evidence-based diagnosis.

Conclusion: RAD provides a novel framework for explicit knowledge injection in clinical diagnosis, achieving superior performance while ensuring trustworthy, evidence-based diagnosis through improved interpretability and alignment with clinical workflows.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code

*Wenhan Wu,Zheyuan Liu,Chongyang Gao,Ren Wang,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current LLM unlearning methods are vulnerable to relearning attacks that can recover supposedly erased knowledge. The paper proposes StableUN, a bi-level optimization framework that finds more stable parameter regions to prevent knowledge recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods drive models to sharp minima where knowledge remains recoverable through minimal fine-tuning, creating a security vulnerability where erased information can be easily retrieved.

Method: StableUN uses bi-level feedback-guided optimization with neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback (using adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods) with remembering feedback to preserve utility, aligning objectives through gradient projection.

Result: Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks show StableUN is significantly more robust against relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses the robustness gap in LLM unlearning by seeking stable parameter regions, making erased knowledge truly unrecoverable while preserving model functionality.

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that
undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove
sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains
precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root
cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual
data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss
landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can
drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks
exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate
the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly
recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical
robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To
address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided
optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via
neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses
adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering
feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through
gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that
our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and
jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

*Sepehr Maleki,Negar Pourmoazemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pi-Transformer is a physics-informed transformer model that uses dual attention pathways (data-driven and prior-based) for multivariate time series anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance by combining reconstruction error with timing/phase mismatch signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalies in multivariate time series often stem from temporal context and cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers, requiring models that can capture complex temporal invariants and inter-channel relationships.

Method: Uses a transformer with two attention pathways: data-driven series attention and physics-informed prior attention encoding temporal invariants (scale-related self-similarity, phase synchrony). Combines reconstruction objective with divergence term for attention agreement, and fuses alignment-weighted reconstruction with mismatch signals for detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1 scores across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, PSM), with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behavior of the two streams and interpretable detections.

Conclusion: Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems, demonstrating the value of combining data-driven learning with domain knowledge.

Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and
cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present
Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a
data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that
encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase
synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction
error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence
term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them
meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is
lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model
combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch
signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a
single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and
PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with
particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show
complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around
regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a
calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate
systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub

TL;DR: HGMamba-ncRNA is a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model that integrates sequence, secondary structure, and expression features of non-coding RNAs to enhance classification performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis, but existing methods have limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion. Accurate classification is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis.

Method: The model uses: 1) MKC-L (parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM) for sequence features, 2) MSGraphTransformer for secondary structure features, 3) CPKAN (Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) for expression features, and 4) HyperGraphMamba with virtual nodes for multimodal integration.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and other metrics. Extensive studies confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability.

Conclusion: HGMamba-ncRNA offers a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification, providing enhanced multimodal feature integration and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is
essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing
limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose
HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which
integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression
features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the
sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM
architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies
of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer
(MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics
of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev
Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and
interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating
virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction,
HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel
heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets
demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies
further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong
transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA

TL;DR: This paper investigates reinforcement learning approaches for penetration testing automation, focusing on overcoming partial observability challenges in real-world network security scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penetration testing is a sequential decision-making problem suitable for RL automation, but partial observability presents a major challenge that invalidates the Markov property, requiring history aggregation or belief state estimation for successful policy learning.

Method: The study compares vanilla PPO with variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including frame-stacking, historical information augmentation, and recurrent/transformer architectures. Systematic empirical analysis is conducted across different host network sizes.

Result: History aggregation methods significantly outperform other approaches, converging three times faster. Manual policy inspection reveals clear distinctions between algorithms that go beyond quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that penetration testing greatly benefits from history aggregation techniques, leading to more robust and transferable policies crucial for reliable performance in diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security
vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for
reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to
real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it
invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state
estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially
observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size,
aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and
representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more
robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable
performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using
vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a
selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including
frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and
employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We
find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three
times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies
by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go
beyond quantitative results.

TL;DR: PGCLODA is a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework that predicts associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases using a tripartite graph with structural and semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infectious diseases threaten public health, but computational models for predicting oligopeptide-disease associations are scarce despite oligopeptides' advantages as antimicrobial candidates.

Method: Constructs a tripartite graph (oligopeptides, microbes, diseases) with structural/semantic info, uses prompt-guided graph augmentation for contrastive learning, dual encoder (GCN + Transformer) for local/global features, and MLP classifier for prediction.

Result: PGCLODA outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy on benchmark datasets; ablation studies confirm module contributions; case studies validate generalization and biological relevance.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development, with source code publicly available.

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,
underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen
novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates
in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high
bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,
computational models specifically designed to predict associations between
oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a
prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover
potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,
microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic
information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a
prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful
paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global
features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a
benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and
hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies
further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to
uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer
valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug
development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-judged benchmarks have design flaws that introduce noise into rankings. The paper introduces two diagnostic tools (schematic adherence and psychometric validity) to quantify reliability issues, finding severe problems in Arena-Hard Auto benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used but their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional benchmarks, potentially producing high-confidence rankings that are largely noise.

Method: Introduces two diagnostic mechanisms: schematic adherence (quantifies how much verdict is explained by explicit schema) and psychometric validity (aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals). Applied these to Arena-Hard Auto benchmark.

Result: Found severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: unexplained variance exceeding 90% for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. ELO-style aggregation masks genuine ranking uncertainty.

Conclusion: Highlights design failures undermining validity and offers principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks.

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model
behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional
ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and
verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence
rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to
diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's
overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing
unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric
validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to
quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools
to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse
across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent
for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We
also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and
masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that
undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped,
reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at

Motivation: To explore whether video models can follow the same trajectory as LLMs towards general-purpose understanding, moving from task-specific models to unified foundation models.

Method: Using Veo 3, a generative video model trained on web-scale data with similar primitives to LLMs, to test zero-shot performance on diverse vision tasks including object segmentation, edge detection, image editing, physical property understanding, and visual reasoning.

Result: Veo 3 successfully solves a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for, demonstrating capabilities in perception, modeling, and manipulation of the visual world, including early forms of visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models, as evidenced by Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities across multiple vision domains.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,

### [101] [You Only Measure Once: On Designing Single-Shot Quantum Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20090)
*Chen-Yu Liu,Leonardo Placidi,Kuan-Cheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Gabriel Matos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Yomo (You Only Measure Once) is a quantum machine learning design that enables accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to single-shot regime, by replacing Pauli expectation-value outputs with probability aggregation and sharp prediction loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QML models require repeated measurements (shots) for reliable predictions, leading to high inference costs and time overhead, especially problematic since quantum hardware access is typically priced proportionally to shot count.

Method: Yomo replaces traditional Pauli expectation-value outputs with a probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage sharp predictions, avoiding shot-scaling limitations of expectation-based models.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Yomo avoids shot-scaling limitations, and experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm Yomo consistently outperforms baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing channels.

Conclusion: Yomo enables accurate single-shot inference, substantially reducing financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby lowering barriers to practical adoption of quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated
measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This
dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time
overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is
typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose
You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves
accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the
single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a
probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage
sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the
shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms
baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing
channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially
reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby
lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based LLMs show strong graph reasoning performance but their internal mechanisms are poorly understood.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the internal reasoning mechanisms of transformer-based LLMs in graph reasoning tasks, which remain underexplored despite their strong performance.

Method: Using circuit-tracer framework to analyze basic decoder-only transformers, visualizing reasoning traces and quantifying behaviors through experiments with varying graph density and model size.

Result: Identified two core mechanisms: token merging and structural memorization, which underlie path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. These behaviors are influenced by graph density and model size.

Conclusion: Provides a unified interpretability framework for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers, revealing fundamental mechanisms behind their graph reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning
tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these
reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the
basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer
framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two
core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,
which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We
further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph
density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework
for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

*Zihan Zhou,Chenguang Wang,Hongyi Ye,Yongtao Guan,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete data using conditional diffusion models to reconstruct missing portions given observed contexts, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing challenges for existing data-driven approaches to learning physical dynamics.

Method: Partitions incomplete samples into observed context and unobserved query components, trains conditional diffusion model to reconstruct missing query portions given available contexts without requiring complete data supervision.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows asymptotic convergence to true generative process; empirical results demonstrate significant outperformance over baselines on fluid flows and weather systems, especially in limited/irregular observation regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based framework provides an effective, theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed physical dynamics.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine
learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently
incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing
data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based
framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To
this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed
context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting
strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing
query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate
imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete
data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating
that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic
convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity
conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks,
including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance
in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and
imputing partially observed dynamics.

*Francesco Emanuele Stradi,Eleonora Fidelia Chiefari,Matteo Castiglioni,Alberto Marchesi,Nicola Gatti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel algorithm for online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) that improves state-of-the-art results in both stochastic and adversarial constraint settings, achieving sublinear regret and constraint violation without requiring Slater's condition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing best-of-both-worlds algorithms for CMDPs, particularly handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists and providing stronger guarantees on positive constraint violation.

Method: Developed a new algorithm for online episodic CMDPs that works under both stochastic (fixed unknown constraint distributions) and adversarial (arbitrarily changing constraints) regimes, without relying on Slater's condition.

Result: Achieves O~(√T) regret and constraint violation in stochastic regime; provides sublinear constraint violation and α-regret with respect to unconstrained optimum in adversarial regime; validated through synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods, handling more challenging constraint scenarios while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs)
under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm
whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art
best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the
stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but
unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby
handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we
provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint
violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early
episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime,
\emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our
algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition,
and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained}
optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation
factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing
the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

*Junjie Yao,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals how data distribution shapes embedding structures in language models through probability signatures that capture semantic relationships, showing these signatures strongly influence embedding organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While language model embeddings are known to capture semantic relationships, the mechanisms driving the formation of ordered structures like digit sequences remain poorly understood.

Method: Proposed probability signatures reflecting semantic relationships, conducted experiments on composite addition tasks using linear models and feedforward networks, analyzed gradient flow dynamics theoretically, and extended analysis to Qwen2.5 LLMs trained on Pile corpus subsets.

Result: Probability signatures significantly influence embedding structures and are faithfully aligned with them, particularly in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings.

Conclusion: The work uncovers the mechanism of how data distribution guides embedding structure formation, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.

### [106] [Generative Model Inversion Through the Lens of the Manifold Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20177)
*Xiong Peng,Bo Han,Fengfei Yu,Tongliang Liu,Feng Liu,Mingyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes why generative model inversion attacks (MIAs) are effective, finding that they work by projecting noisy gradients onto the generator manifold's tangent space. The authors show that models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align with the generator manifold, and propose both training-based and training-free methods to enhance this alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why generative model inversion attacks are so effective at reconstructing private training data from trained models, and to explore the relationship between loss gradient alignment with the generator manifold and model vulnerability to MIAs.

Method: The authors first analyze gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic inputs, then design a novel training objective to promote gradient-manifold alignment. They also introduce a training-free approach to enhance this alignment during inversion.

Result: Empirical measurements show that loss gradients in standard supervised models often deviate from the data manifold. The proposed methods consistently improve state-of-the-art generative MIAs by better aligning gradients with the generator manifold.

Conclusion: Models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align closely with the generator manifold. This insight enables both training-based defenses and enhanced attack methods through improved gradient-manifold alignment.

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative
samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative
adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process,
yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the
private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we
begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic
inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis
reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by
projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out
off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with
the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with
standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations
from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant
directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become
more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the
generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training
objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we
further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold
alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

### [107] [FairEquityFL -- A Fair and Equitable Client Selection in Federated Learning for Heterogeneous IoV Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20193)
*Fahmida Islam,Adnan Mahmood,Noorain Mukhtiar,Kasun Eranda Wijethilake,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairEquityFL is a novel federated learning framework that ensures fairness in client selection for Internet of Vehicles applications by incorporating a sampling equalizer module and outlier detection mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL frameworks lack fairness considerations in client selection for dynamic and heterogeneous IoV environments, where only a subset of clients can participate in each training round, creating potential inequity issues.

Method: The framework introduces a sampling equalizer module within the selector component to ensure equitable participation opportunities, monitors client participation, and implements an outlier detection mechanism to identify malicious clients based on model performance fluctuations.

Result: Simulation results on FEMNIST dataset show that FairEquityFL significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of fairness and performance.

Conclusion: FairEquityFL effectively addresses fairness challenges in FL client selection for IoV environments while maintaining model performance and detecting malicious participants.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of
applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy
preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead.
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can
be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the
clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent
to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of
researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL
frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed
fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV
environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework
to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL
training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module
within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair
collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.
The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling
the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier
detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the
model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or
loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily
suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further
evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,
FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline
models to a considerable extent.

*Albert Kjøller Jacobsen,Johanna Marie Gegenfurtner,Georgios Arvanitidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes geometry-aware input noise methods that account for the underlying manifold structure of data, improving generalization and robustness compared to traditional ambient noise approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research on input perturbation during training only considered ambient noise without accounting for data manifold structure, which may not be optimal for highly curved manifolds.

Method: Develops several geometry-aware noise methods: projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto tangent spaces and mapping via geodesics, and using Brownian motion noise along manifolds. Framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Result: Geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds.

Conclusion: Accounting for the underlying manifold structure when adding input noise provides better regularization than traditional ambient noise approaches, particularly beneficial for complex, curved data manifolds.

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly
regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and
enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the
addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the
underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of
adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional
manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian
noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise
sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also
consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and
robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while
performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our
proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes estimand-agnostic approaches to make do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs by allowing estimation of any identifiable query from a single model, along with computational acceleration and methods for explaining inaccessible data generating processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP is popular but overlooks causal structure, while do-SHAP uses interventional queries but its reliance on estimands hinders practical application on complex graphs.

Method: Proposes estimand-agnostic approaches for do-SHAP, develops a novel algorithm for computational acceleration, and creates a method to explain inaccessible Data Generating Processes.

Result: Demonstrates successful estimation and computational performance, validated on two real-world datasets with reliable explanations.

Conclusion: The approach makes do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs and provides reliable causal explanations while addressing computational limitations.

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular,
but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP
employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its
practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of
estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any
identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex
graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its
computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible
Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational
performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets,
highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

*Konrad Janik,Peter Benner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces T-HénonNets, a novel neural network architecture that extends HénonNets to handle adaptive time steps for learning time-adaptive symplectic integrators, particularly for irregularly sampled Hamiltonian systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods for learning symplectic integrators (SympNets and HénonNets) require training data with fixed step sizes, but real-world measurement data is often sampled irregularly on non-equidistant time grids.

Method: The authors propose T-HénonNets, a symplectic neural network architecture that can handle adaptive time steps. They extend this architecture to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems and provide universal approximation theorems for separable Hamiltonian systems.

Result: Numerical experiments are performed to investigate the theoretical approximation capabilities of the proposed T-HénonNet architecture.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends HénonNets to handle adaptive time steps, though it discusses the difficulties in handling non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed methods.

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and
H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called
TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar
extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture
called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive
time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems
for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it
is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed
methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we
perform different numerical experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a bottom-up methodology to accurately estimate per-query energy consumption for large-scale LLM systems, showing that previous estimates overstate energy use by 4-20x and identifying opportunities for 8-20x efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and reasoning workflows increase token demand, reliable energy estimates are crucial for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate energy use due to limited benchmarks and failure to reflect scale efficiency gains.

Method: The authors introduce a bottom-up methodology based on token throughput, considering GPU utilization and PUE constraints for models running on H100 nodes under realistic workloads. They extend analysis to test-time scaling scenarios and quantify efficiency gains at model, serving platform, and hardware levels.

Result: For frontier-scale models (>200B parameters), median energy per query is 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67). With 15x more tokens per query, energy rises 13x to 4.32 Wh. Individual efficiency interventions achieve 1.5-3.5x reductions, while combined advances can deliver 8-20x reductions. A deployment serving 1B queries uses 0.8 GWh/day baseline, growing to 1.8 GWh/day with 10% long queries.

Conclusion: Targeting efficiency in high-token regimes delivers the largest fleet-wide savings. With targeted interventions, energy use can be reduced to levels similar to web search at scale, echoing historical data center efficiency gains during internet and cloud build-up.

Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and
agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy
use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and
efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate
energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to
reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce
a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM
systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under
realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median
energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200
billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using
production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and
assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling
scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x
to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver
the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the
model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median
reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can
plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we
estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion
queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8
GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,
similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how
data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains
during the internet and cloud build-up.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid forecasting framework combining dynamic lagged feature engineering, adaptive rolling-window representations, and ensemble learners to address e-commerce finance forecasting challenges like irregular invoice schedules and sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional time-series methods and deep learning models perform poorly in e-commerce finance due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, sparse datasets, and limited historical windows under partial observability.

Method: Integrates dynamic lagged feature engineering, adaptive rolling-window representations with classical statistical models and ensemble learners. Incorporates invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom stability-aware loss functions.

Result: Achieves approximately 5% reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, leading to substantial financial savings. Enhances forecast stability over quarterly horizons and strengthens feature-target correlation by capturing both short- and long-term patterns.

Conclusion: Combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral insights significantly advances predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series forecasting for e-commerce finance applications.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly
challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and
user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse
datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional
time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have
shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial
observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature
engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical
statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates
invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom
stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and
irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%
reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial
financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over
quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both
short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and
simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of
combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral
insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar strong performance as SimPO in online RLHF settings, given SimPO's success in offline preference optimization.

Method: Experimental investigation of Maximum Entropy RL in online RLHF settings, comparing its performance and stability against KL-constrained methods.

Result: Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics even at low learning rates, failing to prevent reward hacking unlike stable KL-constrained methods.

Conclusion: Reference-free approaches face distinct challenges in online vs offline settings; SimPO succeeds offline while Maximum Entropy RL struggles online, suggesting different optimization dynamics between the two scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

TL;DR: Hybrid training combining Backpropagation for offline learning and Predictive Coding for online adaptation enables efficient on-device domain adaptation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single static models are insufficient for dynamic real-world environments where input data distributions change due to factors like sensor drift or lighting variations, necessitating continual model adaptation.

Method: Start with offline training using Backpropagation for high initial performance, then use Predictive Coding for online adaptation to recover accuracy lost from input distribution shifts.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show effective adaptation with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach offers a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments, especially suitable for resource-constrained edge devices and neuromorphic accelerators.

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: xLRA is a compact tensor decomposition framework that efficiently predicts local elastic response from microstructures using minimal data and computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting mechanical response from microstructure is computationally expensive with physics-based simulations, and existing data-driven methods require large datasets. xLRA addresses the need for efficient structure-property linkage learning.

Method: Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA) uses canonical polyadic tensor decomposition to map high-dimensional microstructural features to local elastic response, adaptively incorporating higher rank terms with maximum rank of 4.

Result: xLRA accurately predicts local elastic strain fields using only 5% of dataset, achieves transferability across material systems (composites, polycrystals), and outperforms contemporary methods with 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations.

Conclusion: xLRA provides an efficient, scalable framework for predicting elastic response from microstructures, demonstrating superior data efficiency, generalizability, and computational performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of
heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet
this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of
microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the
microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the
development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property
linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven
approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To
address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation
(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It
efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local
elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately
predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a
maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate
predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant
data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results
across representative material systems, including two phase composites and
single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains
essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen
microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods
in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while
requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,
xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from
microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

### [116] [Alignment-Sensitive Minimax Rates for Spectral Algorithms with Learned Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20294)
*Dongming Huang,Zhifan Li,Yicheng Li,Qian Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Effective Span Dimension (ESD), a new complexity measure for spectral algorithms with learned kernels, showing minimax risk scales as σ²K and connecting feature learning to generalization improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework for analyzing spectral algorithms when kernels are learned from data, overcoming limitations of traditional fixed-kernel theories that require restrictive eigen-decay or source conditions.

Method: Introduces Effective Span Dimension (ESD) as an alignment-sensitive complexity measure, analyzes sequence models, over-parameterized gradient flow, and extends the framework to linear models and RKHS regression with numerical validation.

Result: Proves that for sequence models with ESD at most K, minimax excess risk scales as σ²K, and shows gradient flow can reduce ESD, demonstrating provable generalization improvements through adaptive feature learning.

Conclusion: The ESD framework provides a novel perspective on generalization that works for arbitrary kernels and signals, connecting adaptive feature learning with provable benefits in spectral algorithms beyond traditional fixed-kernel analysis.

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

### [117] [Graph Variate Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20311)
*Om Roy,Yashar Moshfeghi,Keith Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs) introduce a novel GNN framework that dynamically constructs signal-dependent connectivity tensors to model evolving spatio-temporal signals without relying on predefined graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs assume fixed underlying graph structures, which may not exist or be independently derived from signals. Real-world spatio-temporal signals require modeling dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without arbitrary sliding windows.

Method: GVNNs build on Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) and graph signal processing tools, using layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with signal-dependent connectivity tensors combining stable long-term support with instantaneous data-driven interactions.

Result: GVNNs achieve linear complexity in sequence length and consistently outperform graph-based baselines in forecasting benchmarks, being competitive with LSTMs and Transformers. They also achieve strong accuracy in EEG motor-imagery classification.

Conclusion: GVNNs provide an effective framework for modeling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals, demonstrating potential for applications like brain-computer interfaces while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.

### [118] [A Recovery Guarantee for Sparse Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20323)
*Sara Fridovich-Keil,Mert Pilanci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical guarantees for sparse recovery of ReLU neural network weights using iterative hard thresholding with linear memory growth relative to nonzero weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical foundations for recovering sparse network weights in neural networks, addressing the memory inefficiency of existing methods like iterative magnitude pruning.

Method: A simple iterative hard thresholding algorithm that recovers sparse network weights exactly under certain structural properties of two-layer, scalar-output ReLU networks.

Result: Theoretical guarantees are validated through experiments on sparse planted MLPs, MNIST classification, and implicit neural representations, showing competitive or superior performance compared to memory-inefficient baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides efficient sparse recovery of neural network weights with linear memory requirements while maintaining or exceeding the performance of more memory-intensive approaches.

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks,
where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered.
Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for
two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard
thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows
linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result
with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST
classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find
performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but
memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

### [119] [Feature Dynamics as Implicit Data Augmentation: A Depth-Decomposed View on Deep Neural Network Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20334)
*Tianyu Ruan,Kuo Gai,Shihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why deep networks generalize well by examining temporal consistency in feature evolution, showing that predictions remain stable when combining shallow features from earlier checkpoints with deeper features from later ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental question of why deep networks generalize well, moving beyond classical generalization theory by examining internal feature evolution rather than just inputs and outputs.

Method: Study temporal consistency in feature evolution across training checkpoints, analyze stability when combining features from different depths, and use statistical tests to examine SGD noise patterns.

Result: Reveals temporal consistency as a form of implicit structured augmentation that supports generalization, extends to unseen/corrupted data but collapses with random labels, and shows SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with principal directions.

Conclusion: Provides a conceptual perspective linking feature dynamics to generalization, suggesting future work on practical surrogates for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization
theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and
outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a
phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow
features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.
This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of
implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that
temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when
semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests
further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal
directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.
Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature
dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates
for measuring temporal feature evolution.

### [120] [Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph Learning for Account Takeover Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20339)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,William Andrew Byron,Xin Sun,Amirfarrokh Iranitalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS is a graph-based framework for Account Takeover fraud detection that models sessions as spatio-temporal graphs, achieving significant improvements in AUC and reducing customer friction compared to traditional tabular methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ATO detection systems using tabular gradient-boosted trees overlook relational and temporal patterns in coordinated fraud attacks, limiting their effectiveness in detecting fraud rings while maintaining low latency and minimal user friction.

Method: ATLAS reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. It links entities via shared identifiers with time-window constraints, enabling causal message passing and latency-aware label propagation using GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling.

Result: On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivered 6.38% AUC improvement and more than 50% reduction in customer friction, significantly improving fraud detection while reducing user impact.

Conclusion: Graph-based approaches like ATLAS effectively capture relational and temporal patterns in ATO fraud, outperforming traditional tabular methods by leveraging spatio-temporal graph structures for more accurate and less intrusive fraud detection.

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer
banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction
for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular
gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions
independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online
activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce
ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a
framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node
classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links
entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates
connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,
time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses
only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We
operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor
sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B
edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38
percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer
friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

*Ramona Rubini,Siavash Khodakarami,Aniruddha Bora,George Em Karniadakis,Michele Dassisti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIF models integrate process knowledge with deep learning for temperature forecasting in pharmaceutical lyophilization, outperforming pure data-driven methods in accuracy, physical consistency, and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for industrial forecasting lack physical consistency and robustness, limiting their reliability in regulated environments like pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Method: Developed process-informed forecasting (PIF) models using various approaches (ARIMA, ETS, KANs) with three loss formulations: fixed-weight loss, dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and Residual-Based Attention mechanism to integrate process knowledge.

Result: PIF models demonstrated superior performance over data-driven counterparts in accuracy, physical plausibility, and resilience to sensor noise, with successful transfer learning to new processes.

Conclusion: This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical pharmaceutical applications by combining process knowledge with modern deep learning techniques.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone
of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel
at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to
physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in
regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models
for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range
of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning
architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three
different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed
trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for
accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.
Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a
transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models
outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical
plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing
reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in
the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

### [122] [The Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19512)
*Charles Dansereau,Junior-Samuel Lopez-Yepez,Karthik Soma,Antoine Fagette*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper identifies a lack of standardized testbeds for cooperative Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), which hinders progress in this underexplored research area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HeMARL addresses real-world problems with heterogeneous agents, but current research is limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks, leading to the use of simple or weakly heterogeneous environments that don't adequately challenge algorithms.

Method: The paper proposes the need for establishing standardized environments for cooperative HeMARL, similar to existing benchmarks like ALE and SMAC used in single-agent RL and homogeneous MARL.

Result: The analysis reveals that current HeMARL research often uses environments where algorithms perform near optimally, failing to provide meaningful benchmarks for evaluating true progress in heterogeneous agent cooperation.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for developing standardized testbeds specifically designed for cooperative HeMARL to enable proper benchmarking and accelerate research in this important domain.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which
gained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to
a much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in
this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where
agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based
on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving
heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored,
as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical
robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and
SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.
However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative
HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,
where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL
environments.

### [123] [Knowledge Base-Aware Orchestration: A Dynamic, Privacy-Preserving Method for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19599)
*Danilo Trombino,Vincenzo Pecorella,Alessandro de Giulii,Davide Tresoldi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: KBA Orchestration enhances multi-agent systems by using dynamic, privacy-preserving relevance signals from agents' knowledge bases to improve task routing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static agent descriptions become outdated in dynamic environments, leading to inefficient task routing as agent capabilities evolve.

Method: Augments static descriptions with dynamic relevance signals derived from agents' internal KBs using lightweight ACK signals without exposing private data, combined with a shared semantic cache.

Result: Significantly outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall system efficiency.

Conclusion: KBA Orchestration enables more accurate and adaptive task routing while preserving agent autonomy and data confidentiality, suitable for large-scale systems requiring higher accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly tasked with solving complex,
knowledge-intensive problems where effective agent orchestration is critical.
Conventional orchestration methods rely on static agent descriptions, which
often become outdated or incomplete. This limitation leads to inefficient task
routing, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities
continuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a
novel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,
privacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal
knowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are
insufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the
subagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against
its private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the
underlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,
providing dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By
combining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves
more accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data
confidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly
outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall
system efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require
higher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.
