In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection in multi-agent systems under inconsistent beliefs, offering probabilistic guarantees and selective communication.", "motivation": "Existing methods assume identical beliefs among agents, which is often impractical due to limited communication, leading to poor coordination and unsafe outcomes.", "method": "Introduction of a decentralized framework that accounts for belief inconsistencies, providing guarantees for action consistency and performance relative to a baseline, with selective communication.", "result": "The approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in simulations.", "conclusion": "The framework effectively addresses belief inconsistencies, enabling safer and more efficient multi-agent decision-making with minimal communication."}}

These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study.

Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentReuse is a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents that reduces latency by effectively reusing previously generated plans for similar user requests via semantic evaluation and intent classification.", "motivation": "The latency for generating plans with LLMs in assistants like Xiao Ai and Blue Heart V can degrade user experience.

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment.

However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHRP is a structured pruning framework for Transformer encoders that removes redundant attention heads via Expert Attention and a shared feed-forward network, achieving high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss for web-scale NLP tasks.", "motivation": "Transformer encoders have high inference latency and memory consumption due to architectural redundancy, especially in the attention module, posing challenges for real-time serving; the independence of attention heads enables structured compression.", "method": "SHRP treats each attention head as an independent expert module, adds a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network to refine outputs, and uses a Top-1 usage-driven mechanism for dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment.", "result": "On GLUE with BERT-base, SHRP reduces parameters by 48% while maintaining 93% of original accuracy; in extreme compression (pruning 11/12 layers), it keeps 84% accuracy, achieves 4.2x throughput gain, and reduces FLOPs to 11.5%.", "conclusion": "SHRP effectively compresses Transformer encoders, balancing accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating practical utility for large-scale, latency-sensitive web deployments by addressing redundancy in attention heads."}}

This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter.
