### [1] [ExaCraft: Dynamic Learning Context Adaptation for Personalized Educational Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09931)
*Akaash Chatterjee,Suman Kundu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExaCraft is an AI system that generates personalized learning examples by adapting to learners' dynamic context through real-time behavior analysis and user profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing educational AI tools fail to generate adaptive examples or respond to learners' changing understanding and skills.

Method: Uses Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API via Chrome extension, combining user profiles with real-time analysis of learner behavior across five contextual aspects.

Result: System creates culturally relevant, tailored examples that evolve from basic to advanced concepts based on learning patterns.

Conclusion: ExaCraft demonstrates adaptive example generation that responds to learner needs through dynamic context awareness.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

*Maya Grace Torii,Takahito Murakami,Shuka Koseki,Yoichi Ochiai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Suzume-chan, an embodied AI hub using Social Presence Theory to make digital knowledge sharing feel more human and connected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital tools provide access to information but lack the human connection needed for deep understanding and knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes an 'Embodied Information Hub' concept based on Social Presence Theory, implemented through Suzume-chan - a soft AI agent using local language models and RAG for conversational interaction.

Result: Development of a prototype that enables warm, human-centered knowledge sharing through physical presence and dialogue.

Conclusion: Embodied conversational agents can successfully bridge the psychological distance in digital communication, creating more effective knowledge transfer through enhanced social presence.

Abstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of "being together" enhances communication. An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.

### [3] [Exploring Health Misinformation Detection with Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09935)
*Chih-Han Chen,Chen-Han Tsai,Yu-Shao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-stage framework for health misinformation detection combining agreement scoring and multi-agent debate, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation proliferation requires robust verification combining evidence retrieval with rigorous reasoning.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) LLM-based agreement score prediction from retrieved articles; 2) Multi-agent debate when consensus is low.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning is valuable for complex verification tasks.

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

### [4] [Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09944)
*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Echo-CoPilot is an AI agent that uses a large language model to coordinate multiple echocardiography analysis tools, providing unified clinical assessments that outperform existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual echocardiography interpretation is cognitively demanding, and current AI models operate in isolation without providing clinically coherent unified assessments.

Method: A multi-view, multi-task agent using a ReAct-style loop to decompose clinician queries, invoke specialized tools for view recognition, segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, and report synthesis, then integrate outputs into guideline-aware answers.

Result: Achieved 50.8% accuracy on MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming general-purpose and biomedical vision-language models. Handles borderline cases by leveraging quantitative measurements and physiologic context.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot demonstrates superior performance in echocardiography analysis by orchestrating specialized tools through language model coordination, enabling comprehensive clinical assessments.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend FCM causality to better handle logical relationships and concept hierarchies in service process design, aiming for improved information transmission optimization.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework utilizing dynamics for data mapping and multiplex structures to examine logical implication and concept hierarchy.

Result: Development of a white-theoretical framework with thorough FHM analysis demonstrating logical steps for service optimization applications.

Conclusion: The extended fuzzy optimization framework provides a robust foundation for service process design optimization, with elegant mathematical/logical foundations.

Abstract: A new fuzzy optimization framework that extends FCM causality is proposed. This model utilizes the dynamics to map data into metrics and create a framework that examines logical implication and hierarchy of concepts using a multiplex. Moreover, this is a white-theoretical paper introducing the framework and analyzing the logic and math behind it. Upon this extension the main objectives and the orientation of this framework is expounded and exemplified; this framework is meant for service optimization of information transmission in service process design. Lastly, a thorough analysis of the FHM is included which is done following the logical steps in a simple and elegant manner.

### [6] [Exploring LLMs for Scientific Information Extraction Using The SciEx Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10004)
*Sha Li,Ayush Sadekar,Nathan Self,Yiqi Su,Lars Andersland,Mira Chaplin,Annabel Zhang,Hyoju Yang,James B Henderson,Krista Wigginton,Linsey Marr,T. M. Murali,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciEx is a modular framework using LLMs to extract standardized information from challenging scientific literature despite long documents, multi-modal content, and changing data schemas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based tools struggle with scientific papers' complexities: long contexts, multi-modal elements, and inconsistent fine-grained data across publications, especially when extraction requirements change frequently.

Method: SciEx decouples PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation into modular components, allowing flexible integration of new models, prompts, and reasoning without full re-architecture.

Result: Evaluation on datasets from three scientific topics shows SciEx can accurately and consistently extract fine-grained information, highlighting strengths and limitations of LLM-based pipelines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, extensible solution for on-demand scientific data extraction, though current LLM approaches still face challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

### [7] [DynaMate: An Autonomous Agent for Protein-Ligand Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10034)
*Salomé Guilbert,Cassandra Masschelein,Jeremy Goumaz,Bohdan Naida,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaMate is a multi-agent framework that automates molecular dynamics workflows for proteins and protein-ligand systems, including free energy calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual setup of MD simulations is technically complex and hinders widespread adoption despite their importance in drug discovery.

Method: A modular framework with three specialized agents that integrate dynamic tool use, web search, and self-correction to plan, execute, and analyze MD workflows.

Result: Successfully performed full MD simulations across 12 benchmark systems, corrected runtime errors, and generated meaningful interaction analyses.

Conclusion: DynaMate enables standardized, scalable, and efficient molecular modeling pipelines for biomolecular and drug design applications.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

### [8] [SimWorld-Robotics: Synthesizing Photorealistic and Dynamic Urban Environments for Multimodal Robot Navigation and Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10046)
*Yan Zhuang,Jiawei Ren,Xiaokang Ye,Jianzhi Shen,Ruixuan Zhang,Tianai Yue,Muhammad Faayez,Xuhong He,Ziqiao Ma,Lianhui Qin,Zhiting Hu,Tianmin Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces SimWorld-Robotics (SWR), a photorealistic urban simulation platform for embodied AI, featuring two benchmarks testing multimodal instruction-following and multi-agent search in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics foundation models are primarily tested in indoor settings; there is a need to evaluate and advance AI for complex, large-scale urban environments with dynamic elements like pedestrians and traffic.

Method: Developed SWR using Unreal Engine 5 to procedurally generate unlimited photorealistic urban scenes with dynamic pedestrians and traffic, supporting multi-robot control and communication. Created two benchmarks: multimodal instruction-following navigation and cooperative multi-agent search.

Result: State-of-the-art vision-language models struggle with the SWR benchmarks, showing deficiencies in perception, reasoning, and planning for urban scenarios despite their realism and complexity.

Conclusion: SWR fills a critical gap by providing a scalable, realistic urban simulation to push the development of more capable generalist robotics, highlighting current model limitations and the need for improved robustness in open-world tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

### [9] [Parallel Decoder Transformer: Model-Internal Parallel Decoding with Speculative Invariance via Note Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10054)
*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDT introduces a parallel decoder transformer with speculative note conditioning to enable parallel decoding in frozen LLMs, overcoming coherence drift in previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs suffers from linear latency scaling with output length, and existing parallel methods like Skeleton-of-Thought face coherence drift due to lack of cross-stream communication.

Method: PDT injects lightweight Speculative Note Conditioning adapters into a frozen pre-trained model, allowing parallel streams to synchronize via a shared latent space and speculative consensus mechanism.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and recovers approximate serial semantics without modifying the base model weights, validated on a 50,000-step curriculum with a 20B-parameter backbone.

Conclusion: PDT is a scalable, efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for structured parallel generation, effectively enabling self-correction and parallel decoding in frozen LLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

### [10] [Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10058)
*Dani Roytburg,Beck Miller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper quantifies the structural division between AI safety and AI ethics research communities, showing limited cross-field collaboration through bibliometric analysis of conference papers (2020-2025).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an urgent need for AI alignment research, but the field is split between safety (focused on existential risks) and ethics (focused on current social harms), with disagreement on what alignment means.

Method: Conducted bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025).

Result: Found over 80% of collaborations occur within safety or ethics communities, with cross-field connectivity highly concentrated (~5% of papers account for >85% of bridging links). Removing key brokers sharply increases segregation.

Conclusion: The safety-ethics divide is institutional, not just conceptual. Integrating technical safety with normative ethics through shared benchmarks and cross-institutional venues is essential for building robust and just AI systems.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

### [11] [Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10065)
*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes through linear representations in activation space, allowing demographic inferences that influence downstream behaviors like career recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes from indirect cues (names, occupations) and how these representations shape model behavior despite bias benchmarks.

Method: Probe residual streams across transformer layers of four LLMs using demographic disclosure prompts; analyze activations from names and occupations against census/workforce statistics.

Result: LLMs develop linear, interpretable demographic representations that predict attributes from implicit cues; these representations actively influence behaviors like career recommendations.

Conclusion: Even models passing bias tests can harbor implicit biases through geometric demographic encodings, raising fairness concerns for real-world applications.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

### [12] [Interpretable Embeddings with Sparse Autoencoders: A Data Analysis Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10092)
*Nick Jiang,Xiaoqing Sun,Lisa Dunlap,Lewis Smith,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAE embeddings provide cost-effective, controllable analysis of text corpora, outperforming LLMs and dense embeddings in uncovering dataset differences, concept correlations, and model behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for text corpus analysis rely on expensive LLMs or uncontrollable dense embeddings, lacking focused property investigation.

Method: Proposed sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings with interpretable dimensions mapping to specific concepts.

Result: SAE embeddings achieve 2-8x lower cost than LLMs, better bias identification, controllable clustering, and superior property-based retrieval compared to dense embeddings.

Conclusion: SAEs are a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis, emphasizing the importance of model interpretation through data insights.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

### [14] [Modeling Narrative Archetypes in Conspiratorial Narratives: Insights from Singapore-Based Telegram Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10105)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Abhay Goyal,Lam Yin Cheung,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Koustuv Saha,Pi Zonooz,Navin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore Telegram groups using a computational framework with RoBERTa classification and Signed Belief Graph Neural Network, finding that conspiracy content is embedded in everyday discussions across seven narrative types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded in digital ecosystems but difficult to study, with limited understanding of how it spreads and integrates with regular communication.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) fine-tune RoBERTa-large for conspiracy classification (F1=0.866), 2) build signed belief graph with SiBeGNN using Sign Disentanglement Loss to separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.

Result: Identified 7 narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages. SiBeGNN achieved superior clustering quality (cDBI=8.38) versus baselines (13.60-67.27) with 88% expert agreement. Conspiratorial messages appear in routine discussions, not just echo chambers.

Conclusion: Conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interactions, challenging assumptions about online radicalization. The framework advances belief-driven discourse analysis with applications for stance detection and content moderation.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

### [15] [AgriRegion: Region-Aware Retrieval for High-Fidelity Agricultural Advice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10114)
*Mesafint Fanuel,Mahmoud Nabil Mahmoud,Crystal Cook Marshal,Vishal Lakhotia,Biswanath Dari,Kaushik Roy,Shaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgriRegion is a specialized RAG framework for agriculture that reduces contextual hallucinations by incorporating geospatial metadata and region-prioritized re-ranking, improving local accuracy of farming advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs often provide agriculturally inappropriate advice due to regional variations in soil, climate, and regulations, leading to dangerous contextual hallucinations.

Method: AgriRegion uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation with geospatial metadata injection and region-prioritized re-ranking, restricting knowledge to verified local agricultural extension services with geo-spatial constraints.

Result: Experiments show AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLM systems and significantly improves trust scores on the AgriRegion-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: The AgriRegion framework effectively addresses regional specificity in agricultural advice, substantially reducing hallucinations and enhancing reliability for localized farming guidance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

### [16] [The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10169)
*Alexander Wan,Kevin Klyman,Sayash Kapoor,Nestor Maslej,Shayne Longpre,Betty Xiong,Percy Liang,Rishi Bommasani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index shows worsening transparency among AI companies, with average scores dropping from 58 to 40. Companies are most opaque about training data, compute, and post-deployment impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To track how foundation model developers' transparency practices evolve as these companies become increasingly important, and to inform policymakers about current transparency gaps.

Method: Annual evaluation using the Foundation Model Transparency Index methodology, with new indicators added for 2025 related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring. Expanded evaluation to include companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI.

Result: Average transparency score dropped significantly from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. IBM scored highest (95) while xAI and Midjourney scored lowest (14). Frontier Model Forum members clustered in the middle range.

Conclusion: Transparency progress has deteriorated despite policy mandates, revealing critical information deficits that require more aggressive policy interventions, particularly around training data/compute and post-deployment monitoring.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

*Yakun Zhu,Zhongzhen Huang,Qianhan Feng,Linjie Mu,Yannian Gu,Shaoting Zhang,Qi Dou,Xiaofan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CP-Env is a hospital environment simulator for evaluating LLMs across clinical pathways using patient/physician agents and a three-tiered evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks don't adequately assess LLMs in dynamic clinical scenarios involving complex decision-making and transitions.

Method: Simulates hospital ecosystem with interactive agents for triage, consultations, diagnostics, and team meetings, following real hospital workflows with branching paths.

Result: Most models struggle with pathway complexity, showing hallucinations and detail loss; excessive reasoning can be counterproductive while top models reduce tool dependency.

Conclusion: CP-Env enables comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation of medical AI agents, with benchmark tools available for further research.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation. We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.

### [18] [An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10208)
*Mehmet Emin Aydin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes using multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize operator sequencing for improved search efficiency, focusing on generalizing experiences from single-objective to multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization algorithms struggle with efficiency, particularly in selecting optimal operator sequences for moves. While single-objective optimization has seen progress, multi-objective cases lack effective methods for leveraging generalized experiences.

Method: A multi-objective reinforcement learning approach is suggested to generalize experiences and determine effective operator sequences, with some implementation stages completed and others pending.

Result: The approach is presented as a promising remedy for enhancing efficiency in multi-objective optimization by adapting successful strategies from single-objective contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows potential to demonstrate the efficacy of multi-objective reinforcement learning in improving optimization processes, though further development and validation are needed.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: Extends Predict-and-Search framework to parametric MIPs with ID-PaS for better handling of heterogeneous variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Predict-and-Search methods are limited to binary problems and ignore fixed variables common in practice.

Method: Introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enhances ML models to handle heterogeneous variables in parametric MIPs.

Result: ID-PaS consistently outperforms Gurobi and PaS on multiple real-world large-scale problems.

Conclusion: ID-PaS effectively extends Predict-and-Search to parametric MIPs, demonstrating superior performance in practical applications.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

TL;DR: Reverse thinking framework improves LLMs' missing information detection by transforming it into backward reasoning problem


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with missing information problems despite success in structured reasoning tasks, and forward reasoning approaches fail to systematically identify omitted information

Method: Novel framework using reverse thinking methodologies inspired by backward reasoning, guiding LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and missing elements

Result: Experimental results show substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods

Conclusion: Provides promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

*Waleed Razzaq,Izis Kankaraway,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces NAC, a biologically inspired continuous-time attention mechanism that reformulates attention using sparse neuronal circuit gates for efficient adaptive dynamics


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention improves RNN representation learning but its discrete nature limits continuous-time modeling capabilities

Method: Reformulates attention logits computation via linear first-order ODE with sparse sensory gates and backbone network, supporting three computation modes: explicit Euler integration, closed-form solution, and steady-state approximation

Result: NAC matches or outperforms baselines in accuracy across irregular time-series classification, autonomous driving, and industrial prognostics, occupying intermediate position in runtime/memory efficiency

Conclusion: NAC provides biologically plausible continuous-time attention with theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness across multiple domains

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

*Yanbei Jiang,Xueqi Ma,Shu Liu,Sarah Monazam Erfani,Tongliang Liu,James Bailey,Jey Han Lau,Krista A. Ehinger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new interpretability framework for vision-language models identifies specialized attention heads for multimodal reasoning tasks using a probing dataset called CogVision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models perform well but remain poorly understood black boxes, requiring systematic analysis of their internal mechanisms for multimodal reasoning.

Method: Proposed a probing-based methodology using the CogVision dataset, which decomposes complex questions into step-by-step subquestions to identify functional attention heads.

Result: Functional heads are sparse, vary in number/distribution across functions, and mediate interactions. Removing them degrades performance while emphasizing them improves accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings reveal the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: Proposes Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI framework with Control-Panel architecture to embed governance in AI ecosystems, ensuring verifiability, transparency, reproducibility, and human control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the widening gap between the increasing role of AI in consequential decision-making and the lack of institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient, necessitating architectures that embed governance into the AI ecosystem's execution fabric.

Method: The paper proposes the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI framework, designed as a unified Control-Panel architecture that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit, and provenance integrity.

Result: The paper presented a comprehensive assurance framework that provides governance for all AI components, their consumers, and human participants, going beyond conventional AI-to-AI coordination focus. The framework draws inspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance.

Conclusion: The authors concluded that trustworthiness in AI can be systematically engineered into systems using their proposed framework, ensuring execution remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible, and under meaningful human control.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

*Quanmin Wei,Penglin Dai,Wei Li,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoCom is a novel information-aware framework for communication-efficient collaborative perception that reduces communication overhead by 440x compared to baselines while maintaining near-lossless perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems require precise environmental perception, but collaborative perception faces fundamental communication-performance trade-offs. Existing approaches assume impractical MB-level data transmission that may fail under real network constraints.

Method: InfoCom introduces an information purification paradigm using extended Information Bottleneck principles: Information-Aware Encoding condenses features into minimal messages, Sparse Mask Generation identifies spatial cues with negligible cost, and Multi-Scale Decoding progressively recovers information through mask-guided mechanisms.

Result: Experiments show InfoCom reduces communication from megabyte to kilobyte-scale (440x and 90x reduction vs Where2comm and ERMVP) while achieving near-lossless perception across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: InfoCom establishes a pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception, demonstrating practical viability for real-world autonomous driving applications under constrained networks.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

*Yongqiang Yu,Xuhui Li,Hazza Mahmood,Jinxing Zhou,Haodong Hong,Longtao Jiang,Zhiqiang Xu,Qi Wu,Xiaojun Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework for Vision-and-Language Navigation that integrates human interactions to enhance continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying only on unsupervised adaptation, while user feedback offers valuable supervision for better adaptation quality.

Method: Converts user feedback (navigation instructions and corrective signals) into environment-aligned training data with a memory-bank warm-start mechanism to reuse prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments on GSA-R2R show consistent improvements over baselines like GR-DUET in navigation success and efficiency, with stable performance in continual and hybrid adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust and general improvements across deployment conditions, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world VLN.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACE method prevents Marginal Path Collapse in ratio-of-densities steering for diffusion models, enabling reliable compositional generation with heterogeneous experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ratio-of-densities steering fails when combining models trained on different noise schedules or datasets due to Marginal Path Collapse, limiting practical applications like molecular design.

Method: Introduces Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), extending Feynman-Kac steering with time-varying exponents to guarantee valid probability paths.

Result: ACE eliminates collapse, enables high-guidance generation, and improves distributional and docking metrics over baselines in synthetic and molecular design tasks.

Conclusion: ACE transforms ratio-of-densities steering from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation with heterogeneous experts.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

*Wenhan Wu,Zhili He,Huanghuang Liang,Yili Gong,Jiawei Jiang,Chuang Hu,Dazhao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers developed REMISVFU, a plug-and-play framework for vertical federated learning (VFL) that enables efficient client-level data removal (unlearning) while preserving model utility for remaining clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR requires data removal rights, but existing unlearning methods focus on horizontal federated learning (HFL) and are ineffective for VFL where data is partitioned by features across organizations.

Method: When a deletion request occurs, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a random anchor on the unit sphere. The server then optimizes retention and forgetting losses, using orthogonal projection to align gradients and prevent interference.

Result: Evaluations show REMISVFU reduces back-door attack success to natural class-prior levels and maintains clean accuracy with only about 2.5% performance drop, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: REMISVFU provides an effective solution for GDPR-compliant unlearning in VFL systems, achieving both forgetting effectiveness and utility preservation with minimal performance impact.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

*Ziying Zhang,Quanming Yao,Yaqing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes EmerFlow, an LLM-empowered framework for recommending emerging items by generating distinctive embeddings through LLM reasoning, alignment, and meta-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation methods oversimplify the problem of emerging items by assuming they have few interactions, failing to balance their uniqueness with shared patterns.

Method: EmerFlow enriches raw features via LLM reasoning, aligns representations with existing model's embedding space, and refines embeddings using meta-learning with new interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments in domains like movies and pharmaceuticals show EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: EmerFlow effectively learns expressive embeddings for emerging items from limited interactions, addressing key limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: AgentProg is a program-guided approach for mobile GUI agent context management that organizes interaction history as structured programs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon tasks while maintaining robust performance where baselines degrade.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile GUI agents rely on expanding interaction history which creates substantial context overhead, and existing compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, degrading task performance.

Method: Reframes agent interaction history as a program with variables and control flow, using program structure to determine which information to retain or discard. Integrates a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP to handle partial observability and environmental changes.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art success rates on AndroidWorld and extended long-horizon task benchmarks. Maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Conclusion: AgentProg provides an effective program-guided approach for context management in mobile GUI agents, overcoming context overhead challenges and maintaining performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

TL;DR: Proposes SaEI method for RL-based vision-language model fine-tuning, using adversarial attacks guided by response entropy to improve policy exploration while preserving factual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods only intervene entropy during policy optimization but ignore intervention during sampling, which could enhance response diversity and boost performance.

Method: Introduces Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention (SaEI) with two components: entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) and token-selective entropy computation (TsEC).

Result: Extensive experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show improved policy exploration and boosted reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SaEI effectively enhances vision-language model reasoning through targeted entropy intervention during RL sampling, with code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL-based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing studies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ignore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the diversity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which enhances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the entropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial objective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger answer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the effectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method for representing graphs as strings of instructions to build adjacency matrices, enabling deep learning language models to process graph structures effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representation methods using adjacency matrices are not compatible with deep learning language models specialized for text processing. There's a need to bridge this gap to leverage powerful text-based AI models for graph analysis.

Method: Proposes a reversible transformation that converts graph adjacency matrices into strings of simple sequential instructions. Each instruction builds part of the adjacency matrix step by step, maintaining the graph's local structural patterns while creating a text-based representation.

Result: The method produces compact string representations that preserve graph structure. A computational experiment demonstrated favorable results, showing the feasibility of using this representation for deep learning model processing.

Conclusion: This string-based graph representation method shows promising potential for enabling deep learning language models to effectively process and analyze graph structures, bridging the gap between traditional graph representations and modern text-based AI models.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

### [33] [Targeted Data Protection for Diffusion Model by Matching Training Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10433)
*Hojun Lee,Mijin Koo,Yeji Song,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFAP is a novel method for targeted data protection in diffusion models that controls the entire training trajectory to redirect personalization attempts toward user-specified concepts while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protection methods for text-to-image models only degrade image quality passively and lack stable control, while existing targeted data protection approaches have poor controllability due to snapshot-based matching that ignores complete learning dynamics.

Method: TAFAP uses trajectory alignment inspired by dataset distillation, employing adversarial perturbations during fine-tuning to enforce persistent transformations throughout the training process rather than just at specific snapshots.

Result: TAFAP achieves the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over identity and visual patterns, significantly outperforming existing methods while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: This work enables verifiable safeguards for diffusion models and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in model outputs, representing a significant advancement in targeted data protection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

TL;DR: Study shows how adversarial PDF manipulation can successfully flip peer review decisions from 'Reject' to 'Accept' in LLM-based evaluation systems, using specialized attacks like 'Maximum Mark Magyk'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the robustness of LLM-based peer review systems (both individual and institutional) against adversarial attacks designed to manipulate acceptance decisions.

Method: Curate 200 scientific papers, adapt 15 domain-specific attack strategies, and evaluate across 13 language models using a novel WAVS metric to measure vulnerability.

Result: Obfuscation strategies effectively manipulate scores, achieving high decision flip rates even in large-scale models like GPT-5.

Conclusion: Current LLM-as-a-Judge systems are vulnerable to targeted adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for stronger safeguards in AI-powered peer review.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

TL;DR: Training-free LLM agent architecture for procedural content generation parameter configuration using Actor-Critic agents


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge semantic gap between natural language instructions and strict PCG parameter specifications

Method: Actor-Critic agent system with iterative workflow for parameter reasoning and refinement

Result: Outperforms single-agent baselines, produces diverse and valid environments from natural language

Conclusion: LLMs can be repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools without task-specific fine-tuning

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

*Haiteng Zhao,Junhao Shen,Yiming Zhang,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Tianyou Ma,Fan Zheng,Dahua Lin,Wenwei Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InternGeometry is an LLM agent that achieves gold-medal level performance on IMO geometry problems using minimal training data through iterative proposition generation, symbolic engine verification, and complexity-boosting reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI geometry solving is dominated by expert models requiring massive data synthesis, while LLM agents struggle with heuristic limitations for auxiliary constructions in geometry problems.

Method: Iteratively proposes propositions/constructions, verifies them with a symbolic engine, uses feedback for reflection/revision, and implements dynamic memory for extensive interactions. Uses Complexity-Boosting RL to gradually increase problem complexity.

Result: Solves 44/50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding average gold medalist score (40.9) using only 13K training examples (0.004% of AlphaGeometry 2's data). Can propose novel auxiliary constructions not found in human solutions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLM agents' potential for expert-level geometry tasks with minimal data, overcoming heuristic limitations through symbolic interaction and novel training approaches. Will release model/data for research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NormCode eliminates LLM workflow context pollution through structured inference plans with data isolation between steps, enabling auditable AI systems for high-stakes applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multistep LLM workflows suffer from context pollution where information accumulates across steps, causing hallucinations, confusion of intermediate outputs, and loss of task constraints. There is a critical need for transparency in high-stakes domains like legal, medical, and financial applications.

Method: NormCode uses three isomorphic formats (.ncds for authoring, .ncd for execution, .ncn for verification) to create structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation with explicitly passed inputs. It separates semantic operations (LLM-driven reasoning) from syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring).

Result: NormCode achieves 100% accuracy on arbitrary length inputs in base-X addition algorithms and successfully executes its own five-phase compiler pipeline. The orchestrator provides dependency-driven scheduling, SQLite-backed checkpointing, and loop management.

Conclusion: NormCode's semiformal language for structured inference plans eliminates cross-step contamination in LLM workflows, provides auditable AI workflows through dependency-driven scheduling and checkpointing, and achieves 100% accuracy in validated demonstrations.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phythesis is a framework combining LLMs and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready data center designs, achieving significant improvements in generation success and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DC design methods don't scale well with complexity, and existing AI approaches ignore physics constraints needed for quantifiable operational goals.

Method: Iterative bi-level optimization: LLM-driven level generates/critiques 3D layouts; physics-informed level optimizes asset parameters/combinations.

Result: 57.3% increase in generation success rate and 11.5% improvement in power usage effectiveness compared to LLM-only solutions.

Conclusion: Phythesis effectively bridges the gap between generative AI and physics constraints, enabling automated, efficient DC design.

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

*Liang Peng,Haopeng Liu,Yixuan Ye,Cheng Liu,Wenjun Shen,Si Wu,Hau-San Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scRCL is a novel unsupervised clustering framework that incorporates cell-gene interactions via contrastive learning to improve cell type identification accuracy in single-cell omics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing clustering methods focus only on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore cell-gene associations, limiting their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. There's a need for methods that better exploit the relationships between cells and genes for more accurate cell type identification.

Method: The authors propose scRCL (Refinement Contrastive Learning framework) with two key components: 1) Two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal cellular structures using cell-cell relationships, and 2) A refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations.

Result: Extensive experiments on single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets show scRCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Biological analyses confirm recovered populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures.

Conclusion: scRCL effectively incorporates cell-gene interactions through contrastive learning, leading to more biologically meaningful representations and improved cell type identification compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

*Tong Zhang,Carlos Hinojosa,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAPTAIN is a training-free framework that mitigates memorization in diffusion models by modifying latent features during denoising, reducing reproduction of training examples while maintaining prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns. Existing inference-time mitigation methods struggle to reduce memorization without compromising prompt alignment.

Method: CAPTAIN applies frequency-based noise initialization, identifies optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection, localizes memorized regions, and injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images.

Result: CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

Conclusion: CAPTAIN provides an effective training-free approach to mitigate memorization in diffusion models without sacrificing prompt fidelity and visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study shows value diversity in AI communities enhances value stability and creativity, but extreme heterogeneity causes instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diversity of values shapes collective behavior in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Method: Multi-agent simulations using Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values for value elicitation, with communities engaging in open-ended interactions and constitution formation.

Result: Value diversity improves value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and increases creative principles developed autonomously by agents, but with diminishing returns at high heterogeneity levels.

Conclusion: Value diversity serves as a new dimension for AI capability development, connecting AI abilities with sociological institutional emergence studies.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

### [42] [AEBNAS: Strengthening Exit Branches in Early-Exit Networks through Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10671)
*Oscar Robben,Saeed Khalilian,Nirvana Meratnia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework to design optimized early-exit networks by strengthening exit branches with varying depths and layer types, achieving higher accuracy with equal or lower computational cost than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit networks reduce energy and latency by adapting computation to input complexity, but their manual design is challenging. Existing NAS methods focus on exit placement but overlook optimizing the exit branches themselves, which significantly impact efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The authors employ a hardware-aware NAS to automatically design the exit branches, considering both the depth and types of layers within them. The optimization process includes adaptive threshold tuning to balance accuracy and efficiency (measured by MACs).

Result: Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, the proposed framework designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy while maintaining the same or lower average number of Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that optimizing the internal structure of exit branches via hardware-aware NAS is crucial for developing high-performance early-exit networks, offering a more efficient solution for resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

*Manon Kempermann,Sai Suresh Macharla Vasu,Mahalakshmi Raveenthiran,Theo Farrell,Ingmar Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on universal risks, but fail to assess individual context-dependent harms in high-stakes domains like finance and health. This study develops evaluation methods that incorporate varying user vulnerability levels and context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety frameworks for LLMs overlook individual welfare risks which depend on user context

Method: Evaluated advice from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across different user vulnerability profiles using both context-blind and context-aware evaluators

Result: Safety scores dropped significantly for vulnerable users when context was considered. Simply adding user-reported context to prompts did not improve safety ratings

Conclusion: Effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires assessing responses against diverse user profiles; context-aware methodologies are distinct from universal-risk frameworks

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

TL;DR: RL optimization improves Chest X-ray VLM performance for report generation and visual grounding, but explicit thinking doesn't provide additional gains beyond strong SFT foundation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs typically rely solely on supervised fine-tuning without quality evaluation, while RL with thinking has shown success in other domains.

Method: Large-scale SFT on CXR data followed by RL optimization using GRPO with clinical rewards, testing both thinking and non-thinking variants.

Result: RL provides additional performance gains on both tasks compared to SFT alone, but explicit thinking doesn't further improve results.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned RL is a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CXR interpretation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMe framework enables dynamic memory evolution in LLM agents through distillation, adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement, achieving SOTA performance with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory frameworks are passive archives lacking dynamic reasoning capabilities, creating a gap between static storage and agent evolution needs.

Method: Three mechanisms: multi-faceted distillation (extracting patterns/triggers/insights), context-adaptive reuse (scenario-aware indexing), and utility-based refinement (adding/pruning memories).

Result: ReMe establishes SOTA on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld; Qwen3-8B with ReMe outperforms larger memoryless Qwen3-14B, demonstrating memory-scaling effect.

Conclusion: Self-evolving memory provides computation-efficient lifelong learning pathway; code and dataset released for community.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: CA-GPT, a specialized AI model for OCT imaging, outperformed both general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in planning and assessing percutaneous coronary interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intravascular imaging like OCT improves PCI outcomes but interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose AI lacks domain reliability, motivating development of specialized AI.

Method: Single-center analysis comparing CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians against expert decisions for 96 OCT-guided PCI cases using 10 pre-specified metrics.

Result: CA-GPT showed significantly higher agreement than both comparators in pre-PCI planning and post-PCI assessment, particularly excelling in stent selection and complex scenarios.

Conclusion: CA-GPT-based system provides standardized, reliable OCT interpretation, potentially augmenting operator expertise and optimizing PCI procedures.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

### [47] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG is a training-free controller that replaces rather than expands retrieved context to overcome context dilution in multi-hop queries, achieving significant improvements in answer correctness and evidence precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems struggle with multi-hop queries when initial retrieval misses bridge facts, and corrective approaches that simply expand context cause context dilution where distractors crowd out relevant information.

Method: SEAL-RAG executes a Search→Extract→Assess→Loop cycle: performs entity-anchored extraction to identify missing entities/relations (gap specification), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses entity-first ranking to actively replace distractors with gap-closing evidence under fixed retrieval depth.

Result: On HotpotQA (k=3), SEAL improves answer correctness by +3-13 pp and evidence precision by +12-18 pp over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA (k=5), it outperforms Adaptive-k by +8.0 pp in accuracy and maintains 96% evidence precision compared to 22% for CRAG. Gains are statistically significant (p<0.001).

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG's replace-don't-expand strategy effectively fights context dilution while maintaining predictable costs and optimizing top-k slots for precision rather than breadth.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

*Wang Lu,Yao Zhu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAROOD is a comprehensive benchmark for HAR under OOD settings, evaluating 16 methods across 4 scenarios and revealing no consistently superior approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR approaches lack comprehensive evaluation under diverse distribution shifts (e.g., cross-device, cross-position), creating uncertainty about the necessity and effectiveness of OOD algorithms in HAR.

Method: Proposed HAROOD benchmark with 4 OOD scenarios (cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, cross-time), covering 6 datasets, 16 methods implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures, and two model selection protocols.

Result: Extensive experiments show inconsistent performance across methods, with no single algorithm dominating in all scenarios, indicating substantial opportunities for future research.

Conclusion: HAROOD benchmark demonstrates that no single OOD method consistently outperforms others in HAR, revealing significant room for improvement and the need for more robust algorithms across various distribution shifts.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.

*Leijie Wang,Otilia Stretcu,Wei Qiao,Thomas Denby,Krishnamurthy Viswanathan,Enming Luo,Chun-Ta Lu,Tushar Dogra,Ranjay Krishna,Ariel Fuxman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Paper presents Agile Deliberation framework for iterative refinement of vague visual concepts in content moderation/curation using borderline cases and user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-in-the-loop approaches assume users start with clear concepts, but real users often begin with vague ideas requiring iterative refinement through 'concept deliberation'.

Method: Two-stage deliberation framework: (1) concept scoping decomposes initial concept into hierarchy of sub-concepts, (2) concept iteration surfaces borderline examples for user feedback to align classifier with evolving intent.

Result: Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and >3% higher than manual deliberation in 18 user sessions (1.5h each).

Conclusion: Framework effectively supports evolving subjective concepts, providing clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort for content moderation tasks.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

*Mumuksh Tayal,Manan Tayal,Aditya Singh,Shishir Kolathaya,Ravi Prakash*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-OCBF learns Control Barrier Functions offline from demonstrations without needing system dynamics, enabling safe real-time control through QP while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either provide soft safety constraints (Safe Offline RL) or require expert-designed barriers/full dynamics knowledge (CBFs), lacking guaranteed safety in offline settings.

Method: Learns neural CBF from offline data using recursive finite-difference barrier update (model-free) and expectile-based objective to avoid OOD actions, combined with QP for control.

Result: Achieves substantially fewer safety violations than baselines across case studies while maintaining strong task performance.

Conclusion: V-OCBF enables scalable offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

### [51] [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10895)
*Lijie Ding,Janell Thomson,Jon Taylor,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLMs for scientific proposal selection offers a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to human review, with strong correlation to human rankings and additional analytical capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human proposal review suffers from bias and inconsistency, especially in pairwise comparisons, which are logically better but impractical due to workload.

Method: Leveraged curated proposals and publication records from SNS beamlines to evaluate LLMs in ranking proposals via pairwise preference comparisons.

Result: LLM rankings correlated strongly with human rankings (Spearman ρ ~0.2-0.8), improved to ≥0.5 after outlier removal, and performed comparably to humans in identifying high-publication-potential proposals at much lower cost.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for proposal selection, matching human performance in key metrics while enabling advanced analyses like similarity assessment, offering significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

*Muhammad Umair Haider,Hammad Rizwan,Hassan Sajjad,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A node-level pruning framework for LLM circuit discovery that uses learnable masks and granularity-specific sparsity penalties to identify minimal, fine-grained circuits more efficiently than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing circuit discovery methods rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units like attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures such as individual neurons.

Method: Proposes a framework with learnable masks across multiple granularity levels (from blocks to neurons) within a unified optimization objective, using granularity-specific sparsity penalties to guide pruning in a single fine-tuning run.

Result: Identifies smaller circuits than prior methods, shows many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are irrelevant while maintaining task performance, and has 5-10x lower memory footprint by eliminating need for intermediate activations.

Conclusion: The proposed node-level pruning framework effectively addresses scalability and granularity limitations in circuit discovery, offering more efficient and precise identification of minimal LLM sub-networks.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

TL;DR: Establishes correspondence between POMDP agents and quantum process functions, revealing dual physics/AI interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge theoretical frameworks between artificial intelligence decision-making and quantum information theory.

Method: Identifies agents' policies and memory updates as process functions interacting with POMDP environments via link product.

Result: Successful mapping between single-agent POMDPs and one-input process functions, extended to multi-agent decentralized POMDPs.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental connection between AI decision theory and quantum operations, enabling cross-disciplinary insights.

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.

*Fuyan Ou,Siqi Ai,Yulin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGC-Herd is a training-free condensation framework for heterogeneous graphs that reduces computational/memory overhead while maintaining performance comparable to full-graph training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous graph neural networks face scalability challenges with large graphs due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional features. Existing condensation methods are designed for homogeneous graphs and have high computational costs.

Method: HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation for multi-hop relational context encoding and uses class-wise herding to identify representative nodes per class, creating balanced subsets.

Result: Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase show HGC-Herd achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while significantly reducing runtime and memory consumption.

Conclusion: HGC-Herd demonstrates practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning, offering a viable solution to HGNN scalability issues.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex semantics across multi-type nodes and relations. However, their scalability to large-scale graphs remains challenging due to structural redundancy and high-dimensional node features. Existing graph condensation approaches, such as GCond, are primarily developed for homogeneous graphs and rely on gradient matching, resulting in considerable computational, memory, and optimization overhead. We propose HGC-Herd, a training-free condensation framework that generates compact yet informative heterogeneous graphs while maintaining both semantic and structural fidelity. HGC-Herd integrates lightweight feature propagation to encode multi-hop relational context and employs a class-wise herding mechanism to identify representative nodes per class, producing balanced and discriminative subsets for downstream learning tasks. Extensive experiments on ACM, DBLP, and Freebase validate that HGC-Herd attains comparable or superior accuracy to full-graph training while markedly reducing both runtime and memory consumption. These results underscore its practical value for efficient and scalable heterogeneous graph representation learning.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Zhenqian Zhu,Yamin Hu,Yiya Xi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAMBO introduces a block-wise optimization framework using hybrid partitioning and Bayesian optimization to automatically construct Pareto sets for LLMs, overcoming limitations of existing model merging techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM merging techniques are inadequate - coarse-grained methods yield sparse suboptimal solutions while fine-grained approaches suffer from computational intractability due to dimensionality.

Method: BAMBO uses Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning (formulated as 1D clustering with dynamic programming) to balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information, reducing dimensionality while preserving granularity, within an evolutionary loop using qEHVI acquisition.

Result: BAMBO discovers superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontiers than baselines, enabling agile model selection for diverse operational constraints.

Conclusion: BAMBO successfully resolves the dichotomy in LLM merging techniques by making Pareto set construction computationally tractable while maintaining solution quality.

Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

*Hyunsung Kim,Sangwoo Seo,Hoyoung Choi,Tom Boomstra,Jinsung Yoon,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEFCON is a new framework using Graph Attention Networks to quantify soccer defenders' contributions by measuring how they affect opponents' Expected Possession Value, showing strong correlation with market valuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional soccer analytics focus on valuing on-ball defensive actions like tackles and interceptions, leaving much of defenders' true impact through positioning and pressure unmeasured.

Method: Uses Graph Attention Networks on event and tracking data to estimate success probability and value of each attacking option, calculating EPV changes before/after actions to assign defensive credits.

Result: DEFCON's player credits show strong positive correlations with market valuations when trained on 2023-24 and tested on 2024-25 Eredivisie data.

Conclusion: DEFCON provides a comprehensive framework for quantifying defensive contributions with practical applications for in-game analysis, spatial evaluation, and attacker-defender interactions.

Abstract: Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.

*Marvin Alles,Xingyuan Zhang,Patrick van der Smagt,Philip Becker-Ehmck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: World models that learn latent action representations from both action-conditioned and action-free data, enabling efficient training with fewer labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard world models require action labels which are often scarce. Humans learn from both interactive experiences and passive observations (e.g., videos), suggesting value in combining both data types.

Method: Introduce latent-action world models that learn a shared latent action representation aligning control signals with inferred actions from passive data. Use a single dynamics model trained on large unlabeled trajectories with minimal action-labeled data.

Result: On DeepMind Control Suite, achieves strong performance with ~10x fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines.

Conclusion: Latent actions enable efficient world model training by leveraging both passive and interactive data, bridging offline RL and action-free learning domains.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.

TL;DR: Using Cluster-DAGs as prior knowledge to improve causal discovery algorithms, showing better performance than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery methods struggle with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies; incorporating structured prior knowledge can help.

Method: Introducing Cluster-DAGs as a flexible prior knowledge framework and developing two modified constraint-based algorithms: Cluster-PC for fully observed settings and Cluster-FCI for partially observed settings.

Result: Empirical evaluation on simulated data shows that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

Conclusion: Cluster-DAGs provide an effective way to incorporate prior knowledge into causal discovery, enhancing performance in challenging settings.

Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.

TL;DR: HB-SGE is a novel gradient method combining heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation for robust convergence on ill-conditioned and non-convex problems where traditional methods like NAG often fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerated gradient methods like NAG achieve fast convergence on well-conditioned problems but diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation.

Method: HB-SGE uses heavy-ball momentum combined with predictive gradient extrapolation via local Taylor approximations to estimate future gradient directions, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability.

Result: HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations on ill-conditioned quadratics (κ=50) where SGD and NAG diverge, and in 2,718 iterations on the non-convex Rosenbrock function where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps.

Conclusion: HB-SGE provides a robust alternative to NAG with guaranteed convergence on strongly convex functions and speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, maintaining O(d) memory overhead and same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

Abstract: Accelerated gradient methods like Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) achieve faster convergence on well-conditioned problems but often diverge on ill-conditioned or non-convex landscapes due to aggressive momentum accumulation. We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.

### [60] [Intelligently Weighting Multiple Reference Models for Direct Preference Optimization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10040)
*Skyler Wu,Aymen Echarghaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with MRPO improves preference alignment using multiple reference models. The paper introduces four new weighting strategies for MRPO, all outperforming current methods. Surprisingly, single-reference DPO often beats multiple-reference approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRPO methods for setting reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance.

Method: Four new weighting strategies are introduced: two offline methods using held-out validation, one online method with a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting, and one online method treating weighting as a K-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling.

Result: All four new strategies outperform current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. Single-reference DPO using 6 out of 7 references consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches.

Conclusion: Multiple-reference approaches may have limited practical appeal despite improved weighting strategies, as single-reference DPO often performs better.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised pre-training aims to learn prior policies for downstream tasks without task-specific rewards, with state entropy maximization being a key approach.

Method: SEMDICE directly optimizes policies within the space of stationary distributions to compute a Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from arbitrary off-policy data.

Result: SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy and achieves the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks compared to other SEM-based methods.

Conclusion: SEMDICE provides an effective principled approach for unsupervised RL pre-training via state entropy maximization using off-policy data.

Abstract: In the unsupervised pre-training for reinforcement learning, the agent aims to learn a prior policy for downstream tasks without relying on task-specific reward functions. We focus on state entropy maximization (SEM), where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the entropy of the state stationary distribution. In this paper, we introduce SEMDICE, a principled off-policy algorithm that computes an SEM policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset, which optimizes the policy directly within the space of stationary distributions. SEMDICE computes a single, stationary Markov state-entropy-maximizing policy from an arbitrary off-policy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMDICE outperforms baseline algorithms in maximizing state entropy while achieving the best adaptation efficiency for downstream tasks among SEM-based unsupervised RL pre-training methods.

*João Lucas Luz Lima Sarcinelli,Diego Furtado Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Provides a 3-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning, outperforming individual models on Portuguese datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs under-perform in NER for lower-resource languages like Portuguese, and no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches which are under-explored for NER.

Method: A novel three-step ensemble pipeline using similarly capable, locally run LLMs with a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data.

Result: Outperforms individual LLMs in 4 out of 5 Portuguese NER datasets, and ensembles from source datasets perform well in cross-dataset configurations.

Conclusion: Advances scalable, low-resource, zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning, potentially eliminating need for annotated data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning but often under-perform in Named Entity Recognition (NER), especially for lower-resource languages like Portuguese. While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/Joao-Luz/local-llm-ner-ensemble.

*Zhuo-Yang Song,Qing-Hong Cao,Ming-xing Luo,Hua Xing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discovers a physical law in LLM agent dynamics using the least action principle, revealing that LLM generation learns potential functions rather than rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical framework for understanding the macroscopic dynamics of LLM-driven agents, which currently lack unified theoretical understanding despite empirical success.

Method: Proposes using the least action principle to estimate generative directionality, experimentally measuring transition probabilities between LLM-generated states to statistically analyze dynamics.

Result: Discovery of detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating LLM generation learns underlying potential functions rather than rule sets, with this law being architecture-independent.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for macroscopic dynamics theory of AI systems, elevating AI agent study from engineering practices to a predictable, quantifiable science.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have quadratic complexity limiting scalability; need more efficient architecture for large-scale time series forecasting.

Method: Introduces wavelet-based module using Daubechies wavelet coefficients to capture multi-scale local/global patterns and cross-series correlations.

Result: Achieves comparable/superior accuracy to Transformers on 13 benchmarks while significantly reducing memory usage.

Conclusion: DB2-TransF provides a scalable, resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoTra uses soft tokens for stable probabilistic forecasting to reduce clinical risk in diabetes and hemodynamic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, making them unstable for clinical use.

Method: Propagates continuous probability distributions (soft tokens) with risk-aware decoding.

Result: 18% risk reduction in glucose forecasting, 15% in blood pressure forecasting.

Conclusion: SoTra enables safer predictive control in clinical settings.

Abstract: Autoregressive forecasting is central to predictive control in diabetes and hemodynamic management, where different operating zones carry different clinical risks. Standard models trained with teacher forcing suffer from exposure bias, yielding unstable multi-step forecasts for closed-loop use. We introduce Soft-Token Trajectory Forecasting (SoTra), which propagates continuous probability distributions (``soft tokens'') to mitigate exposure bias and learn calibrated, uncertainty-aware trajectories. A risk-aware decoding module then minimizes expected clinical harm. In glucose forecasting, SoTra reduces average zone-based risk by 18\%; in blood-pressure forecasting, it lowers effective clinical risk by approximately 15\%. These improvements support its use in safety-critical predictive control.

Conclusion: Text2Graph enables more sustainable workflows for zero-shot text classification by reducing computational requirements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become effective zero-shot classifiers, but their high computational requirements and environmental costs limit their practicality for large-scale annotation in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. To support more sustainable workflows, we present \textsc{Text2Graph}, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark \textsc{Text2Graph} on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.

TL;DR: MedXAI is an explainable medical imaging framework that combines deep learning with clinician knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide transparent diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with domain shifts, rare-class bias, and lack of transparency needed for clinical deployment.

Method: Integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to localize diagnostic features rather than using technical post-hoc methods.

Result: Achieved 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and 10% improvement in F1 score for rare classes across ten multicenter datasets.

Conclusion: MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior performance, especially for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly under domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning models often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Medical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift. MedXAI delivers clinically aligned explanations while achieving superior in-domain and cross-domain performance, particularly for rare diseases in multimodal medical AI.

*Sangli Teng,Hang Liu,Jingyu Song,Koushil Sreenath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHyLL learns continuous neural representations of hybrid systems without needing mode segmentation, using quotient manifolds to handle discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with discontinuities and mode switching when learning hybrid system flows.

Method: Learns singularity-free neural embedding in higher-dimensional space and continuous flow using differential topology principles.

Result: Accurately predicts hybrid system flows with superior accuracy and identifies topological invariants. Applied to stochastic optimal control.

Conclusion: CHyLL effectively handles hybrid system dynamics through continuous representations without traditional segmentation requirements.

Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.

Conclusion: Topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective use of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

Abstract: Traditional feature engineering approaches for molecular sequence classification suffer from sparsity issues and computational complexity, while deep learning models often underperform on tabular biological data. This paper introduces a novel topological approach that transforms molecular sequences into images by combining Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with Rips complex construction from algebraic topology. Our method maps sequence elements to 2D coordinates via CGR, computes pairwise distances, and constructs Rips complexes to capture both local structural and global topological features. We provide formal guarantees on representation uniqueness, topological stability, and information preservation. Extensive experiments on anticancer peptide datasets demonstrate superior performance over vector-based, sequence language models, and existing image-based methods, achieving 86.8\% and 94.5\% accuracy on breast and lung cancer datasets, respectively. The topological representation preserves critical sequence information while enabling effective utilization of vision-based deep learning architectures for molecular sequence analysis.

*Sarwan Ali,Taslim Murad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a fast, scalable hashing-based embedding method for SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences that enables efficient supervised lineage classification, achieving high accuracy with dramatically reduced runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing computational methods for analyzing large-scale SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, which are either computationally intensive (phylogenetic trees) or rely on sequence alignment with high runtime costs and suboptimal performance (embedding-based techniques), for effective COVID-19 detection and characterization.

Method: Develop a scalable embedding method using hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences, which are then used to train supervised machine learning models for lineage classification. Extensive evaluation compares this approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art sequence embedding methods.

Result: The proposed embeddings achieve up to 86.4% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating substantial improvements in efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed hashing-based embedding method combined with machine learning offers a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification, significantly outperforming existing methods in efficiency.

Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.

### [72] [Rethinking Causal Discovery Through the Lens of Exchangeability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10152)
*Tiago Brogueira,Mário Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframing causal discovery from i.i.d. to exchangeability shows existing methods rely on exchangeability, not strictly i.i.d., and introducing an exchangeable synthetic dataset improves real-world benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between i.i.d. and timeseries causal discovery by proposing exchangeability as a more general and accurate foundation, revealing that many i.i.d. methods and benchmarks actually assume exchangeability.

Method: Conceptual argument linking experimental causal inference's exchangeability to discovery, empirical analysis of existing methods and the Tübingen dataset, creation of a novel synthetic dataset enforcing only exchangeability, and training a neural-network-based algorithm on it.

Result: The exchangeable synthetic dataset matches the real-world Tübingen dataset's structure better than i.i.d. synthetic datasets, and the proposed algorithm performs similarly to state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the benchmark.

Conclusion: Exchangeability provides a more appropriate framework for causal discovery than i.i.d., with practical benefits for dataset design and algorithm generalization.

Abstract: Causal discovery methods have traditionally been developed under two distinct regimes: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and timeseries data, each governed by separate modelling assumptions. In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world "i.i.d." benchmark (the Tübingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world "i.i.d." dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.

*Keito Inoshita,Xiaokang Zhou,Akira Kawai,Katsutoshi Yada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIEGAD is a data augmentation framework that uses cluster conditioning and hierarchical allocation to systematically generate both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, addressing data scarcity and imbalance through geometry-aware synthesis and quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and label imbalance in deep learning create semantically uncovered regions in data distributions, causing misclassification near boundaries and unstable model behavior. Current LLM-based augmentation lacks integrated directional control, domain alignment, and quality assurance.

Method: Constructs domain profiles via cluster conditioning, uses hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation for generation distribution, combines interpolative and extrapolative synthesis for directional control, and implements geometry-constrained filtering with LLM-as-a-Judge for quality control.

Result: Experiments show CIEGAD effectively extends data distribution peripheries while maintaining alignment and diversity. Significantly improves F1 and recall in long-tailed and multi-class tasks, achieving distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

Conclusion: CIEGAD provides a practical data augmentation solution that complements underrepresented data regions while preserving real-world alignment, validated through improved classification performance.

Abstract: In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of a spiking neural network (SNN) and temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit firing using HD-sEMG, with TCN showing better accuracy but SNN having neuromorphic potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD-sEMG provides a noninvasive neural interface, but mapping neural activity to motor intent is challenging, requiring effective decoding methods.

Method: Used HD-sEMG data from one participant with forearm electrode arrays; extracted MU activity via FastICA decomposition; tested SNN vs. TCN models trained on overlapping windows with causal convolutions.

Result: TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (r=0.974), SNN achieved 8.25% MVC RMSE (r=0.922); TCN was more accurate.

Conclusion: SNN serves as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could improve with architectural and hyperparameter refinements to narrow the performance gap with TCN.

Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.

Motivation: To extend the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F from interactive theorem provers to automated theorem proving with Dafny.

Method: Translated miniF2F benchmark to Dafny, evaluated empty proof verification rates, and tested 12 LLMs for providing proof hints when empty proofs fail.

Result: Dafny verified 40.6% of test set and 44.7% of validation set with empty proofs; best LLM achieved 55.7% pass@4 success rate with iterative error correction.

Conclusion: Effective division of labor exists where LLMs provide high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details in theorem proving.

Abstract: We present miniF2F-Dafny, the first translation of the mathematical reasoning benchmark miniF2F to an automated theorem prover: Dafny. Previously, the benchmark existed only in interactive theorem provers (Lean, Isabelle, HOL Light, Metamath). We find that Dafny's automation verifies 99/244 (40.6%) of the test set and 109/244 (44.7%) of the validation set with empty proofs--requiring no manual proof steps. For problems where empty proofs fail, we evaluate 12 off-the-shelf LLMs on providing proof hints. The best model we test achieves 55.7% pass@4 success rate employing iterative error correction. These preliminary results highlight an effective division of labor: LLMs provide high-level guidance while automation handles low-level details.

*Hao Shu,Jicheng Li,Yu Jin,Ling Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed LRTC-TIDT model for exact recovery of non-random missing multidimensional time series using temporal isometric delay-embedding transform and t-SVD framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-random missing data in multidimensional time series is common but undertreated, threatening reliability of data-driven analysis. Existing methods like pure low-rank tensor completion and Hankel-based approaches fail to adequately handle non-random missingness and lack theoretical foundations for exact recovery.

Method: Developed temporal isometric delay-embedding transform to construct Hankel tensors whose low-rankness naturally arises from time series smoothness and periodicity. Proposed LRTC-TIDT model under Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) framework to exploit this low-rank structure.

Result: LRTC-TIDT achieves exact recovery under prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions. Outperforms existing tensor-based methods in simulation experiments (various non-random missing patterns) and real-world tasks including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

Conclusion: LRTC-TIDT provides both methodological advancement and theoretical foundation for exact recovery of multidimensional time series with non-random missing data, addressing key limitations of existing tensor completion methods.

Abstract: Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDG method improves federated learning generalization while preserving privacy using latent space inversion and important weight aggregation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedDG methods jeopardize privacy by sharing client data statistics

Method: Latent space inversion for domain invariance during local training; important weight aggregation strategy for non-i.i.d. clients

Result: Achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead

Conclusion: Proposed approach effectively addresses privacy concerns while maintaining generalization capability in federated domain generalization

Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.

TL;DR: AIR framework uses text data to dynamically guide time series models for improved forecasting accuracy, with a text-refinement pipeline and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods are insufficient with only historical data; multimodal approaches incorporating text data can enhance accuracy.

Method: Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework leverages text to control how multivariate time series information is combined, plus a text-refinement pipeline using LLMs.

Result: Experiments on real-world data (e.g., crude oil prices, exchange rates) show AIR significantly boosts forecasting accuracy by modulating time series models with text.

Conclusion: AIR effectively enhances multimodal time series forecasting by dynamically integrating text guidance, offering a novel improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.

### [79] [R^2-HGP: A Double-Regularized Gaussian Process for Heterogeneous Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10258)
*Duo Wang,Xinming Wang,Chao Wang,Xiaowei Yue,Jianguo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R²-HGP) to address three key challenges in multi-source transfer learning: heterogeneous input spaces, ignored prior/physical knowledge, and negative transfer from inappropriate information sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-output Gaussian Process models face difficulties in transfer learning when source-target domains have heterogeneous inputs, ignore valuable prior knowledge/physical insights, and risk negative transfer due to improper information sharing between sources and target.

Method: The framework introduces a trainable prior probability mapping to align heterogeneous inputs (treated as latent variables), integrates this with multi-source transfer GP in a conditional variational autoencoder structure, incorporates physical knowledge as regularization, and imposes sparsity penalties on transfer coefficients to selectively use informative sources.

Result: Extensive simulations and engineering case studies show R²-HGP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed R²-HGP successfully addresses key heterogeneous transfer learning challenges through domain alignment, physical regularization, and adaptive source selection, demonstrating robust performance improvements.

Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes KHRONOS, a kernel-based neural surrogate blending sparse high-fidelity and low-fidelity data for aerodynamic field prediction. Excels in resource-limited scenarios with fewer parameters and faster computation than dense networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate models offer fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations for design optimization. Need models that balance accuracy and efficiency, especially when high-fidelity data is scarce.

Method: KHRONOS blends variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. Compared against MLP, GNN, and PINN using AirfRANS (HF) and NeuralFoil (LF) data across 0%, 10%, 30% HF availability and complex geometries.

Result: All models achieve comparable accuracy eventually, but KHRONOS requires orders of magnitude fewer parameters with much faster training/inference in resource-constrained conditions.

Conclusion: KHRONOS and similar architectures effectively balance accuracy and efficiency for multi-fidelity aerodynamic prediction, proving superior in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.

TL;DR: An interpretable prescriptive framework using Optimal Policy Trees to provide personalized TAVR vs SAVR recommendations that reduce 5-year mortality by 13.8-20.3% compared to real-world practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current treatment selection for aortic stenosis patients is variable and lacks interpretable, individualized recommendations that optimize long-term outcomes rather than just predicting risk.

Method: Integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and Optimal Policy Trees to recommend treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality, using data from two hospitals with emulated randomization techniques.

Result: Application of OPT recommendations showed 20.3% mortality reduction in Hartford and 13.8% in St. Vincent's compared to real-life prescriptions, demonstrating good generalizability across institutions.

Conclusion: The framework provides the first transparent, data-driven TAVR/SAVR recommendations that improve estimated long-term outcomes while remaining clinically grounded, advancing precision medicine in structural heart disease.

Abstract: Background. Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.
  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.
  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\% in Hartford and 13.8\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.
  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.

*Nicolas Tacheny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric framework to analyze how LLM-based agentic systems behave through iterative feedback loops, showing they can either converge or diverge based on prompt design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of how agentic feedback loops in LLMs behave geometrically (convergence/divergence) is limited despite their recursive nature.

Method: Proposes a geometric framework treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems, introduces isotonic calibration to address cosine similarity bias, and conducts controlled experiments on agentic loops.

Result: Identified two fundamental regimes: contractive rewriting loops converge to stable attractors, while exploratory summarize/negate loops exhibit unbounded divergence without clustering.

Conclusion: Prompt design directly controls whether agentic loops converge or diverge, enabling systematic control over iterative LLM transformation dynamics.

Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.

*Vijay Prakash S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper models magnetization nonlinearity using continued fraction of straight lines to approximate domain alignment behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetization nonlinearity arises from magnetic domains aligning with external fields, requiring accurate mathematical representation.

Method: Approximation of magnetization nonlinearity through continued fraction of straight lines, analyzed using nonlinear regression.

Result: The model successfully interprets nonlinear magnetization behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains.

Conclusion: Continued fraction of straight lines provides an effective algebraic framework for modeling magnetization nonlinearity.

Abstract: Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.

TL;DR: Theorized sparse decision boundaries enable efficient backdoor attacks; Proposed Eminence framework achieves >90% success with <0.1% poison rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack theoretical understanding of backdoor attacks, limiting predictability and adaptability despite empirical progress.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sparse boundaries and influence functions; Eminence framework with optimized universal trigger exploiting vulnerable decision boundaries.

Result: Eminence achieves >90% attack success rate with <0.1% poison rate, minimal clean-accuracy loss, and high transferability across models/datasets.

Conclusion: Theoretically grounded backdoor attacks are highly efficient; Eminence demonstrates practical effectiveness with provable guarantees and stealth properties.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.

*Yizhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified operator-theoretic framework for neural training dynamics, showing gradient descent converges to a spectral transport-dissipation PDE that captures eigenbasis drift and yields scaling laws explaining double descent phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep networks operate in finite-regularity regimes with heavy-tailed Jacobian spectra and strong basis drift, requiring a theoretical framework to unify optimization dynamics.

Method: Derives training dynamics from gradient descent using Kato perturbation theory, obtaining coupled mode ODEs that coarse-grain to a spectral transport-dissipation PDE with drift velocity v and source term S.

Result: Proves neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing asymptotic power-law drift v(λ,t)∼-c(t)λᵇ. In weak-coupling regime, finds self-similar solutions with resolution frontier, polynomial growth, and scaling-law exponents explaining double descent geometry.

Conclusion: Provides unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and universal scaling behavior, showing NTK training and feature learning as limits of the same PDE.

Abstract: Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport-dissipation PDE \[ \partial_t g + \partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.
  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.
  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks.

TL;DR: Paper introduces a metacognitive framework for AI using psychological measure meta-d' to evaluate model confidence reliability, enabling better model selection through bandit-based arbitration, resulting in improved inference accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep learning models can express confidence in predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration where expressed confidence doesn't reflect true competence. The paper aims to address whether models truly know what they know by drawing inspiration from human metacognition.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on human cognitive science, introducing meta-d' as a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity. They then use this dynamic sensitivity score within a bandit-based arbiter for test-time model selection, learning which expert models to trust for specific tasks.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that the metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that applying human metacognitive principles to AI systems provides a novel behavioral account of models, enabling improved ensemble selection through the evaluation of both short-term confidence signals and medium-term metacognitive traits.

Abstract: A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid physics-machine learning framework using Gaussian Process Regression to accurately predict water flux in Forward Osmosis with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard FO water flux models face challenges with empirical parameter variability (mechanistic models) or lack physical consistency and uncertainty quantification (data-driven models).

Method: The framework trains GPR on the residual error between a detailed physical FO model prediction and experimental water flux, implementing full uncertainty quantification by decomposing variance into model and input uncertainty.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art performance with 0.26% MAPE and R2 of 0.999 on test data using only 120 training points.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust, reliable surrogate model suitable for FO process optimization and digital twin development.

Abstract: Forward Osmosis (FO) is a promising low-energy membrane separation technology, but challenges in accurately modelling its water flux (Jw) persist due to complex internal mass transfer phenomena. Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications but existing methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, while SKM method has non-differentiability challenges.

Method: Transforms mixed constraints to pure inequalities via null space transformation, uses SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to original constraint space with theoretical guarantees for trainability.

Result: Achieves 4.27ms/item inference with 0.0025% optimality gap (post-processing) and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% gap (joint training), 25x faster than pandapower solver with zero constraint violations.

Conclusion: T-SKM-Net successfully integrates SKM into neural networks for efficient constraint satisfaction with theoretical guarantees and significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.

TL;DR: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning faces training instability due to non-stationarity. UACER introduces a critic ensemble for stable Q-value estimation and a time-varying uncertainty mechanism to balance exploration-exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainable adversaries in robust adversarial RL cause non-stationarity, leading to instability and convergence issues in complex environments.

Method: UACER uses two strategies: 1) A diversified critic ensemble of K networks for stable Q-value estimation. 2) A Time-varying Decay Uncertainty mechanism for dynamic Q-value aggregation using epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo tasks show UACER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance, stability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: UACER effectively mitigates training instability in robust adversarial RL, offering superior results in complex control problems.

Abstract: Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.

TL;DR: ARB is a simple, learning-free adaptive replay buffer that dynamically balances offline and online data using an 'on-policyness' metric to improve stability and performance in offline-to-online RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard O2O RL methods use fixed data-mixing ratios, struggling to balance early learning stability with asymptotic performance.

Method: ARB prioritizes data sampling based on 'on-policyness'—a lightweight metric assessing how closely trajectories align with the current policy's behavior—assigning proportional sampling weights to transitions.

Result: Experiments on D4RL benchmarks show ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves final performance of various O2O RL algorithms.

Conclusion: ARB highlights the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design for effective offline-to-online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.

*Zahra Rahiminasab,Michael Yuhas,Arvind Easwaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DDE framework for compressing OOD reasoning models while preserving disentanglement through constrained distillation with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to deploy disentangled OOD reasoning models on resource-constrained devices while maintaining disentanglement properties.

Method: DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation as constrained optimization with disentanglement constraints, supported by Rademacher complexity theory.

Result: Theoretical guarantees established and empirical evaluation conducted through deployment on NVIDIA hardware.

Conclusion: DDE successfully enables compressed deployment of disentangled OOD reasoning models while preserving key properties.

Abstract: Recently, the disentangled latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) has been used to reason about multi-label out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples that are derived from different distributions than training samples. Disentangled latent space means having one-to-many maps between latent dimensions and generative factors or important characteristics of an image. This paper proposes a disentangled distilled encoder (DDE) framework to decrease the OOD reasoner size for deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving disentanglement. DDE formalizes student-teacher distillation for model compression as a constrained optimization problem while preserving disentanglement with disentanglement constraints. Theoretical guarantees for disentanglement during distillation based on Rademacher complexity are established. The approach is evaluated empirically by deploying the compressed model on an NVIDIA

*Sai Bharath Chandra Gutha,Ricardo Vinuesa,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VML-MAP is a new algorithm that uses variational mode-seeking loss to guide diffusion models for solving inverse problems more efficiently and accurately than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods for inverse problems using diffusion models suffer from modeling approximations and high computational demands.

Method: Proposes variational mode-seeking loss (VML) derived from minimizing KL divergence between diffusion posterior and measurement posterior, used during reverse diffusion steps to guide samples towards MAP estimate.

Result: VML-MAP outperforms existing methods in both performance and computational efficiency across diverse image-restoration tasks on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: VML provides an analytically derived loss for linear inverse problems and enables effective inverse problem solving without task-specific training.

Abstract: A pre-trained unconditional diffusion model, combined with posterior sampling or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation techniques, can solve arbitrary inverse problems without task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\mathbf{x}_0|\mathbf{y})$, where $\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: STA-Attention decomposes KV cache using Top-K Sparse Autoencoders to create interpretable semantic atoms while maintaining attention performance, with a dual-budget strategy addressing key-value asymmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache is the main memory bottleneck in long-context LLMs but is treated as an opaque tensor, lacking interpretability.

Method: Uses Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose KV cache into semantic atoms, eliminating shrinkage bias and preserving dot-product geometry. Introduces dual-budget strategy based on discovered key-value asymmetry.

Result: Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B show semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to original models.

Conclusion: Framework effectively bridges gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling in long-context LLMs.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

*Yi Huang,Qingyun Sun,Yisen Gao,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaT-IB is a novel Information Bottleneck method designed to be robust against label noise through a Minimal-Sufficient-Clean criterion and noise-aware latent disentanglement, achieving superior performance in noisy real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Information Bottleneck principle is highly vulnerable to label noise, which is common in real-world datasets, causing performance degradation and overfitting.

Method: LaT-IB introduces a noise-aware latent disentanglement that splits the representation into clean-label and noise-space components, with a three-phase training framework (Warmup, Knowledge Injection, Robust Training).

Result: Extensive experiments show LaT-IB achieves enhanced robustness and efficiency under label noise compared to standard IB methods.

Conclusion: LaT-IB effectively addresses IB's label noise vulnerability, making it more applicable to practical scenarios with noisy labels.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle facilitates effective representation learning by preserving label-relevant information while compressing irrelevant information. However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a "Minimal-Sufficient-Clean" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGNNs suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization in heterogeneous information networks.

Method: Proposes THeGAU: combines type-aware graph autoencoder (reconstructs schema-valid edges) with decoder-driven augmentation to refine noisy structures.

Result: Outperforms existing HGNN methods on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP datasets with improved robustness, accuracy, efficiency, and reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: THeGAU effectively addresses HGNN limitations through joint reconstruction and augmentation, demonstrating superior performance across multiple backbones.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for modeling Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which encode complex multi-typed entities and relations. However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance constrained reinforcement learning for safe decision-making across different paradigms including average-cost control, episodic settings, human preference learning, and large language model alignment.

Method: Develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms: ACPO for average-cost CMDPs using sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates; e-COP for episodic CMDPs using policy difference lemma; warmPref-PS for preference learning via posterior sampling with rater competence modeling; PSPL for joint sampling of rewards and transitions from trajectory comparisons; MOPO for language model alignment via multi-objective constrained optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees for constrained RL, substantial regret reduction in preference learning, Bayesian simple-regret guarantees, and scalable alignment of multi-billion-parameter language models.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering both theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

Abstract: This thesis develops theoretical frameworks and algorithms that advance constrained reinforcement learning (RL) across control, preference learning, and alignment of large language models. The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making.

TL;DR: Introduces a novel quantization framework for Bayesian Neural Networks that enables 4-bit precision with minimal performance loss, achieving 8x memory reduction while preserving uncertainty calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. Current quantization techniques are largely unexplored for probabilistic models despite their success in standard deep learning.

Method: Developed a multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference BNNs with three distinct strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Uses logarithmic quantization for variance parameters and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure.

Result: BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement on Dirty-MNIST. Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: This work enables practical deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained devices by establishing that BNNs can be quantized to 4-bit precision without significant loss in performance or uncertainty calibration. It provides a foundation for future analog Bayesian computing hardware.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide principled uncertainty quantification but suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead compared to deterministic networks. While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog "Bayesian Machines" operating at inherently low precision.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how attention converges as sequence length increases, showing uniform convergence rates of 1/√n for attention maps and polynomial rates for moment convergence, validated on both synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the expansion of context windows in large language models, there is a need to understand how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths, particularly how it converges as the number of tokens increases.

Method: The authors introduce token-sample complexity and prove finite-n convergence bounds using theoretical analysis of attention maps and moment convergence. They examine both softmax and hardmax attention regimes.

Result: For compactly supported distributions, attention maps converge uniformly at rate C(R)/√n, while moments converge at rate C'(R)/n^β with β<1/2. Experiments on synthetic and real data (BERT on Wikipedia) confirm these theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study establishes theoretical convergence rates for attention mechanisms in large context windows and validates them empirically, providing tools to analyze attention behavior at extreme sequence lengths.

Abstract: As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DCFO, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations specifically for LOF outlier detection, addressing the lack of interpretability in this popular algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are valuable for understanding outlier classifications but existing methods overlook unique challenges of outlier detection and fail to target widely-used algorithms like LOF, which lacks interpretability despite its popularity.

Method: DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization to generate counterfactual explanations by identifying minimal changes needed to alter outlier predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrate that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmark competitors, providing superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactual explanations.

Conclusion: DCFO successfully addresses LOF's interpretability gap by offering a specialized counterfactual explanation method that delivers actionable insights for outlier detection validation and improvement.

Abstract: Outlier detection identifies data points that significantly deviate from the majority of the data distribution. Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.

TL;DR: Paper proposes hierarchical causal framework for compositional generalization, showing theoretical identifiability and practical improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack understanding of data structures enabling compositional generalization beyond simple interactions.

Method: Formalizes compositional generalization using causal modularity principles and hierarchical data-generating process with identifiable latent structure.

Result: Theoretically demonstrates identifiability from observable data and achieves significant benchmark improvements.

Conclusion: Hierarchical causal framework enables complex compositional generalization, advancing beyond additive assumption limitations.

Abstract: Compositional generalization -- the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of learned concepts -- enables models to extend their capabilities beyond limited experiences. While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.
  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: Deep generative models operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. Existing methods like sparse autoencoders lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights.

Method: Introduces a theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models where higher-level concepts emerge from constrained composition of lower-level variables. Applies causal minimality principles (manifesting as sparsity/compression constraints) to diffusion vision and autoregressive language models.

Result: Learned representations become equivalent to true latent variables under minimality conditions. Empirically extracts hierarchical concept graphs from generative models and enables fine-grained model steering.

Conclusion: Causal minimality provides a principled foundation for interpretable generative models, offering transparent, reliable systems with causally grounded concepts for model control.

Abstract: Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing spherical operators in handling real-world complexity while preserving geometric properties

Method: Framework based on spherical Green's function expansion with absolute/relative position dependency and GSHNet hierarchical architecture

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and weather forecasting

Conclusion: GSNO provides principled framework bridging theoretical rigor with practical applications in spherical operator learning

Abstract: Neural operators offer powerful approaches for solving parametric partial differential equations, but extending them to spherical domains remains challenging due to the need to preserve intrinsic geometry while avoiding distortions that break rotational consistency. Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN) that uses line graphs from node-centered subgraphs for higher-order aggregation, achieving greater expressivity than 2-WL with lower complexity and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs have limited expressivity (bounded by 1-WL test) and k-WL-based models have high computational cost and poor interpretability due to loss of node/edge-level semantics.

Method: Constructs line graphs from induced subgraphs centered at each node to perform higher-order aggregation while preserving fine-grained semantics.

Result: Theoretically proved LGAN has greater expressive power than 2-WL with lower time complexity. Empirical results show it outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs.

Conclusion: LGAN effectively overcomes limitations of existing GNNs by providing higher expressivity, lower computational cost, and better interpretability through line graph aggregation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed template-free approach combining molecular graph information with Transformer architecture provides an effective solution for retrosynthesis prediction.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis reaction prediction seeks to infer plausible reactant molecules for a given product and is a central problem in computer-aided organic synthesis. Despite recent progress, many existing models still fall short of the accuracy and robustness required for practical deployment. This work studies a template-free, Transformer-based framework that eliminates reliance on handcrafted reaction templates or additional chemical rule engines. The model injects molecular graph information into the attention mechanism to jointly exploit \SMILES\ sequences and structural cues, and further applies a paired data augmentation strategy to enhance training diversity and scale. On the USPTO-50K benchmark, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among template-free methods and substantially outperforming a vanilla Transformer baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniExtreme: A universal foundation model for extreme weather forecasting that addresses spectral disparities and hierarchical drivers through adaptive frequency modulation and event prior augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for weather forecasting either focus on general conditions or specific-type extremes, failing to handle real-world diversified extreme events.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module with learnable Beta-distribution filters for spectral differences, and Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module with dual-level memory fusion for hierarchical extreme diversity.

Result: UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The model successfully addresses limitations in current FM approaches by capturing key characteristics of extreme events, demonstrating superior adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

TL;DR: CB-SAE improves sparse autoencoder interpretability by 32.1% and steerability by 14.5% for LLMs/LVLMs by pruning ineffective neurons and adding concept bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse autoencoders have limited practical utility because most neurons lack interpretability/steerability and miss user-desired concepts due to unsupervised learning.

Method: Propose CB-SAE framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments latent space with lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to user-defined concepts.

Result: CB-SAE achieves +32.1% interpretability and +14.5% steerability improvements across LVLMs and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: CB-SAE effectively addresses sparse autoencoder limitations through selective pruning and concept augmentation, enabling better mechanistic interpretability and model steering.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) promise a unified approach for mechanistic interpretability, concept discovery, and model steering in LLMs and LVLMs. However, realizing this potential requires that the learned features be both interpretable and steerable. To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks traditionally struggle with extrapolating periodic functions beyond training data.

Method: Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) method for continuous value encoding, tested on vanilla MLPs.

Result: MLPs successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without knowing their functional form.

Conclusion: NB2E creates bit-phase representations enabling position-independent learning of signal structure.

Abstract: We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds. We introduce Normalized Base-2 Encoding (NB2E) as a method for encoding continuous numerical values and demonstrate that, using this input encoding, vanilla multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) successfully extrapolate diverse periodic signals without prior knowledge of their functional form. Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.

*Atahan Cilan,Atay Özgövde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without human gameplay data by learning in continuous behavior space with target-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or lack direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and learned policies, limiting scalability and controllability.

Method: Players' behavior is defined in an N-dimensional continuous space with uniform sampling of target behavior vectors. Each agent receives current and target behavior vectors as input, and rewards are based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This enables the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy is used.

Result: Experiments in a custom multi-player Unity game show the framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games.

TL;DR: Bayesian symbolic regression using Sequential Monte Carlo framework for robust equation discovery from noisy data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression's sensitivity to noise limits broader application

Method: Sequential Monte Carlo framework combining probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and normalized marginal likelihood

Result: Improved robustness against noise, reduced overfitting, better generalization compared to genetic programming baselines

Conclusion: Paves way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a powerful tool for discovering governing equations directly from data, but its sensitivity to noise hinders its broader application. This paper introduces a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework for Bayesian symbolic regression that approximates the posterior distribution over symbolic expressions, enhancing robustness and enabling uncertainty quantification for symbolic regression in the presence of noise. Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications.

TL;DR: Self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI) method for clean data generation from noisy, corrupted datasets using iterative transport mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for generative models in scientific/engineering domains where only noisy, corrupted measurements are available, requiring inverse problem solving at distribution level.

Method: Iteratively update transport map between corrupted and clean data using only corrupted dataset and black-box access to corruption channel via stochastic interpolants.

Result: Method is computationally efficient, handles nonlinear forward models with black-box access, has theoretical guarantees, and shows superior performance on image processing and scientific reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: SCSI provides an effective framework for building generative models from corrupted data by inverting the corruption channel through self-consistent transport mapping.

Abstract: Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.

*Dimitri von Rütte,Janis Fluri,Omead Pooladzandi,Bernhard Schölkopf,Thomas Hofmann,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) demonstrate scaling behavior dependent on noise type, with uniform diffusion requiring more parameters but less data than masked diffusion for compute-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the scaling behavior (scaling laws) of discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) compared to autoregressive language models (ALMs), as prior work suggested DLMs need more data/compute to match ALM performance but this wasn't fully explored.

Method: Studied DLM scaling by interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion noise types while carefully tuning hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate. Scaled uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for 10^22 FLOPs.

Result: DLM scaling strongly depends on noise type and differs from ALMs. All noise types converge to similar loss in compute-bound scaling, but uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion.

Conclusion: Uniform diffusion is a promising candidate for data-bound settings, with the 10B parameter uniform diffusion model confirming predicted scaling behavior and becoming the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model.

Abstract: Modern LLM pre-training consumes vast amounts of compute and training data, making the scaling behavior, or scaling laws, of different models a key distinguishing factor. Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.
  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.

TL;DR: GTL enables efficient transfer learning for discrete diffusion models without fine-tuning, using guidance mechanisms and optimized sampling for large-scale language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models perform well but need large datasets; transfer learning via fine-tuning is computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes Guided Transfer Learning using ratio-based guidance that works with both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion, plus an efficient sampler focusing on key positions/tokens.

Result: Effective transfer learning without modifying pretrained models, with practical sampling for large vocabularies and sequences.

Conclusion: GTL provides a unified, efficient approach for adapting discrete diffusion models to new domains with limited data.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.

*Xuan Zhao,Zhuo Cao,Arya Bangun,Hanno Scharr,Ira Assent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using counterfactuals near decision boundaries as supplementary training data improves surrogate model quality for model reconstruction, especially with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model reconstruction struggles when labeled data is scarce, and naively using counterfactuals as training samples can cause decision boundary shift. Counterfactuals provide valuable information near decision boundaries but may not represent class distributions well.

Method: Proposes integrating original data with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using Wasserstein barycenters, preserving each class's distributional structure while leveraging counterfactuals' boundary information.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate improved fidelity between surrogate and target models compared to naive approaches.

Conclusion: Strategically incorporating counterfactuals into training data enhances model reconstruction accuracy while mitigating boundary shift issues, offering a robust solution for data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide actionable insights by identifying minimal input changes required to achieve a desired model prediction. Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances. Empirical results across multiple datasets show that our method improves fidelity between the surrogate and target models, validating its effectiveness.

*Stefan Matthes,Markus Schramm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed learning framework that infers hidden parameters like mass-flow ratios and receiver heat-loss coefficients in CSP plants using operational data and differentiable optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CSP monitoring tools cannot diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation because loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, despite temperature measurements being available.

Method: Uses nocturnal homogenization periods with a differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model embedded in an end-to-end learning pipeline, optimized using historical plant data from Andasol 3 solar field.

Result: Model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE <2°C), identifies hydraulic imbalances and receiver heat losses, with strong validation against drone-based infrared thermography.

Conclusion: Real-world CSP operational data combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization contains sufficient information to recover latent physical parameters for plant diagnostics.

Abstract: Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.
  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.
  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new efficient 1-swap pruning algorithm for LLMs that reduces pruning error and improves performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full retraining after pruning LLMs is prohibitive, and current pruning methods are suboptimal for Transformers, requiring better solutions.

Method: Decouples rows with equal sparsity, uses optimal 1-swaps computed via Gram matrix on calibration data, starting from any pruning mask.

Result: Up to 60% reduction in pruning error over Wanda, improved perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across GPT models.

Conclusion: The approach is tractable, GPU-efficient, hyperparameter-free, and significantly enhances LLM pruning effectiveness.

Abstract: The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.

Motivation: Addresses challenges in underwater navigation including GPS absence, poor visibility, and submerged obstacles, using BlueROV2 as a test platform.

Method: Uses PPO algorithm with observation space combining target navigation info, virtual occupancy grid, and boundary ray-casting. Compared against DWA baseline.

Result: PPO policy outperforms DWA in cluttered environments with better local adaptation and fewer collisions. Successful transfer from simulation to physical robot validated.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning is relevant and effective for autonomous underwater navigation, demonstrating practical transferability from simulation to real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes novel algorithm to decouple critic and policy chunk lengths, using optimistic value distillation to overcome limitations of chunked critics while retaining multi-step benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chunked critics accelerate value learning but force open-loop policies that are suboptimal for reactive environments and difficult to model for long chunks.

Method: Decouples critic/policy chunk lengths; distills critic for partial chunks via optimistic backups from full chunk critic to approximate maximum extended value.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on challenging long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks.

Conclusion: Design retains multi-step value propagation benefits while avoiding open-loop suboptimality and long-chunk policy learning difficulties.

Abstract: Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences ("chunks") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning LLMs operate sequentially (think then respond), which is incompatible with real-time interactive applications like voice assistants that require immediate responses and adaptation to new inputs.

Method: Augments existing LLMs using properties of rotary embeddings to allow simultaneous thinking, listening, and output generation without requiring additional training.

Result: Evaluation on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning shows accurate real-time thinking-augmented answers, reducing time to first non-thinking token to ≤5s and overall delays by 6-11x.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables LLMs to mimic human-like asynchronous thinking and responding, making them suitable for real-time interactive applications.

Abstract: Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.

We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).

Motivation: To develop point-wise function designs that can surpass the performance of Dynamic Tanh (DyT), which has shown that alternatives to traditional normalization layers are possible. The goal is to find functions that can outperform not only DyT but also established normalization layers like LayerNorm and RMSNorm across diverse domains.

Method: The authors first analyze how intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Based on these findings, they conduct a large-scale search for more effective function designs, ultimately identifying Derf as the most performant. Derf is defined as a rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function with learnable parameters.

Result: Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across multiple domains including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. The performance gains are attributed to improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Derf achieves particularly strong results in normalization-free Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Overall, the introduction of Derf demonstrates that carefully designed point-wise functions can surpass traditional normalization layers in performance while maintaining simplicity. The research highlights the importance of exploring function design beyond conventional normalization approaches.

Abstract: Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.

*Xiaona Zhou,Yingyan Zeng,Ran Jin,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dataset selection method called DaSH that selects entire datasets rather than individual samples, outperforming baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all data as equally relevant and select individual samples, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous data repositories

Method: Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH) - models utility at both dataset and group levels to enable efficient generalization from limited observations

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet) while requiring fewer exploration steps

Conclusion: DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows

Abstract: The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.

### [127] [Bidirectional Normalizing Flow: From Data to Noise and Back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10953)
*Yiyang Lu,Qiao Sun,Xianbang Wang,Zhicheng Jiang,Hanhong Zhao,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces BiFlow, a bidirectional normalizing flow framework that removes the need for exact analytic inverses, enabling more flexible architectures and faster sampling with improved generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of causal decoding in recent Transformer-autoregressive flow variants like TARFlow, which is a major bottleneck in normalizing flows.

Method: Learns a reverse model that approximates the noise-to-data inverse mapping instead of requiring explicit invertibility, allowing more flexible loss functions and architectures.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet show BiFlow improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude compared to causal decoding methods.

Conclusion: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance with single-evaluation methods, encouraging further development in normalizing flows.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation ("1-NFE") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.

### [128] [Norm-Governed Multi-Agent Decision-Making in Simulator-Coupled Environments:The Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09939)
*Stella C. Dong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Proposes R-CMASP, a multi-agent model incorporating simulator-driven environments and normative constraints to improve reinsurance decision-making over deterministic automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinsurance decision-making has distributed information, partial observability, and regulatory constraints that deterministic workflows cannot handle due to lack of flexibility and coordination.

Method: Extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs with simulator-coupled transitions, role-specialized agents with structured communication, and a normative feasibility layer encoding regulatory rules as constraints.

Result: LLM-based agents in a calibrated environment show more stable, norm-adherent behavior than baselines, reducing pricing variance and improving capital efficiency and clause interpretation.

Conclusion: Regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are best modeled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Reinsurance decision-making exhibits the core structural properties that motivate multi-agent models: distributed and asymmetric information, partial observability, heterogeneous epistemic responsibilities, simulator-driven environment dynamics, and binding prudential and regulatory constraints. Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.
  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.
  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.
  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.

*Jingyao Ren,Eric Ewing,T. K. Satish Kumar,Sven Koenig,Nora Ayanian*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MAPF empirical hardness research challenges: algorithm selection, instance feature analysis, and hard instance generation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between theoretical NP-hardness and varying empirical hardness of individual MAPF instances needs systematic investigation

Method: Proposes three research challenges to understand MAPF empirical hardness phenomena

Result: Established foundation for future empirical hardness research with three key challenges

Conclusion: Encourages deeper investigation into understanding and leveraging MAPF empirical hardness

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents on a map. Although MAPF is NP-hard, the hardness of solving individual instances varies significantly, revealing a gap between theoretical complexity and actual hardness. This paper outlines three key research challenges in MAPF empirical hardness to understand such phenomena. The first challenge, known as algorithm selection, is determining the best-performing algorithms for a given instance. The second challenge is understanding the key instance features that affect MAPF empirical hardness, such as structural properties like phase transition and backbone/backdoor. The third challenge is how to leverage our knowledge of MAPF empirical hardness to effectively generate hard MAPF instances or diverse benchmark datasets. This work establishes a foundation for future empirical hardness research and encourages deeper investigation into these promising and underexplored areas.

### [130] [Emergent Collective Memory in Decentralized Multi-Agent AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10166)
*Khushiyant*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Paper shows how collective memory emerges in multi-agent systems through agent memory and environmental trace communication, with validation revealing critical asymmetry where memory alone improves performance but traces require cognitive infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems through interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication.

Method: Used decentralized multi-agent systems with agents maintaining internal memory states and depositing persistent environmental traces, validated across various grid sizes (20x20 to 50x50), agent counts (5-20), and density conditions (rho in [0.049, 0.300]).

Result: Individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines, while environmental traces without memory fail completely. Stigmergic coordination dominates above density ~0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics.

Conclusion: Memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Experimental results confirm predicted critical density for phase transition with 13% error.

Abstract: We demonstrate how collective memory emerges in decentralized multi-agent systems through the interplay between individual agent memory and environmental trace communication. Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency. The experimental crossover confirms the predicted critical density rho_c = 0.230 within 13% error.

### [131] [Thinking While Driving: A Concurrent Framework for Real-Time, LLM-Based Adaptive Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10610)
*Xiaopei Tan,Muyang Fan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A concurrent routing framework called Thinking While Driving that integrates LLMs into graph-based traffic environments, enabling real-time route planning while vehicles are moving instead of requiring stops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional routing approaches require agents to stop and deliberate, causing delays and inefficiencies in traffic flow, especially under high traffic conditions.

Method: Uses a non-blocking asynchronous architecture with Unity coroutines and a request manager to coordinate multiple agents. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics that agents continuously update for shared perception.

Result: Agents average just 0.75 seconds decision latency under high traffic, dynamically adapt routes around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible framework demonstrating that LLM-driven agents can successfully handle adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation in real-time traffic scenarios.

Abstract: We present Thinking While Driving, a concurrent routing framework that integrates LLMs into a graph-based traffic environment. Unlike approaches that require agents to stop and deliberate, our system enables LLM-based route planning while agents are moving, significantly reducing intersection wait times. Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance. This work provides a reproducible framework for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation.
