These issues make it difficult\nto evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,\nLLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,\nand evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:\ndynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation\nmethods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs\nacross mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in\ndistinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel\nfindings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but\nnot limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional\nquestion-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit\n''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones\nwith a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high\nconsistency (robustness)."}

Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka\nmicro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing\nruns of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a\nkey limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data\nscaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across\ncompute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically\nanalyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling\ncurves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can\ninform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition\nmethods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and\navailable compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a\npre-trained model with 7 billion parameters.

However, because ground-truth labels are typically\nunavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model\nperformance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods\naddress this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.\nDespite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate\nthe model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where\nstrong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are\ntwofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction\nmethods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark\ntheir performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well\nas simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix\nestimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on\nmedical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift\nscenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation\ntechniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment\ncontexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for\npostmarket surveillance of medical AI models."}

Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we\nintroduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an\niterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence\nlower bound. We show that the \\textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing\nlog-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models.
