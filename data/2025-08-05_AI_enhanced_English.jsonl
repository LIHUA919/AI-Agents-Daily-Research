We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality.

Our core innovation is an efficient\nparameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable\ndiagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining\ncomputational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,\nwe integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned\nmanifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution\nconvergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that\nunifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method\ndemonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark\ndatasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,\nthe learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying\ngraph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARGNN introduces a framework for adaptive Riemannian metric learning in graphs, outperforming fixed-curvature GNNs by capturing diverse local geometries.", "motivation": "Existing geometric GNNs fail to handle graphs with varying local curvature, necessitating a flexible approach.", "method": "ARGNN learns a continuous, anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field per node, using a diagonal parameterization and Ricci flow-inspired regularization.", "result": "Superior performance on homophilic and heterophilic datasets, with interpretable learned geometries.", "conclusion": "ARGNN unifies prior GNNs, offers theoretical guarantees, and adaptively captures graph structure diversity."}}

While Transformer-based models have recently achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from\ninterpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical\nuncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting\nframework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the\ntheoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular\nencoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a\nspectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose\nstructural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy\nregularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and\ninterpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic\ndynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface\npressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation\ndataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all\nexperiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline\nTransformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term\nforecasting stability.

Recent studies\nhave investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing\nmodel size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a\ncomplementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank\ncompression by capturing salient features in the residual space.
