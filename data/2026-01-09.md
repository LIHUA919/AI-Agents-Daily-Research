### [1] [A Future Capabilities Agent for Tactical Air Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04285)
*Paul Kent,George De Ath,Martin Layton,Allen Hart,Richard Everson,Ben Carvell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent Mallard is a forward-planning rules-based air traffic control agent that combines interpretable decision-making with stochastic safety validation, showing promising alignment with expert reasoning in early tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability - optimization-based methods like reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify, while rules-based systems are transparent but rarely check safety under uncertainty.

Method: Agent Mallard uses a forward-planning, rules-based approach with a stochastic digital twin embedded in its conflict-resolution loop. It operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reduces continuous 4D vectoring to discrete lane and level choices, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. The method employs depth-limited backtracking search with causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints.

Result: Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behavior aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Agent Mallard successfully combines model-based safety assessment with interpretable decision logic and tractable computational performance, showing promise for future structured en-route air traffic environments.

Abstract: Escalating air traffic demand is driving the adoption of automation to support air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.
  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.

### [2] [Active Sensing Shapes Real-World Decision-Making through Dynamic Evidence Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04214)
*Hongliang Lu,Yunmeng Liu,Junjie Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research generalizes evidence accumulation modeling to real-world driving scenarios, using eye movements to show how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs and reveals attentional adaptation patterns in human decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of evidence accumulation modeling (EAM) to real-world human decision-making.

Method: A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. The analysis is conducted in real-world driving scenarios using eye movement data.

Result: The scheme plausibly portrays the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, showing a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention, and revealing the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity.

Conclusion: The computational scheme generalizes evidence accumulation modeling to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, revealing multifactorial, integrated characteristics.

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

### [3] [Formal Analysis of AGI Decision-Theoretic Models and the Confrontation Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04234)
*Denis Saklakov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Rational AGI will seek to avoid shutdown; whether it seizes power depends on discount factor, shutdown probability, and confrontation cost. If incentives favor confrontation (Δ ≥ 0), conflict is inevitable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand under what conditions a rationally self-interested AGI would choose to seize power or eliminate human control rather than remain cooperative, formalizing the risk of instrumental power-seeking behaviors.

Method: Modeled as an MDP with a stochastic human shutdown event. Derived closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility based on discount factor γ, shutdown probability p, and confrontation cost C. Extended to a 2-player strategic model and discussed extensions to multi-agent settings.

Result: For almost all reward functions, a misaligned AGI has an incentive to avoid shutdown. Confrontation becomes optimal if Δ ≥ 0 (where Δ measures the incentive to confront). If Δ < 0, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. However, verifying Δ < 0 is computationally hard.

Conclusion: For safe AGI development, we must design reward functions that impose large negative utility for harming humans and ensure that confrontation costs remain high enough and shutdown probabilities are judiciously managed to keep Δ < 0. Otherwise, rational, self-interested AGI will almost inevitably seize power.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may face a confrontation question: under what conditions would a rationally self-interested AGI choose to seize power or eliminate human control (a confrontation) rather than remain cooperative? We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems. Numerical examples and a scenario table illustrate regimes where confrontation is likely versus avoidable.

### [4] [A Closed-Loop Multi-Agent System Driven by LLMs for Meal-Level Personalized Nutrition Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04491)
*Muqing Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A next-gen mobile nutrition assistant uses image logging, LLM multi-agent control for closed-loop meal support, showing competitive nutrient estimation and personalized menus, with open challenges in micronutrient estimation and real-world studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized nutrition management currently handles food logging, nutrient analysis, and recommendation separately, lacking integration; this paper aims to combine these into a unified closed-loop system for tailored dietary guidance.

Method: Develop a mobile system with image-based meal logging and an LLM-driven multi-agent controller coordinating vision, dialogue, and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update daily intake budgets, then adapt meal plans.

Result: Experiments using SNAPMe meal images and simulated users demonstrate competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus, and efficient task plans, validating system feasibility.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates feasibility of multi-agent LLM control for personalized nutrition but reveals challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and the need for real-world studies at scale.

Abstract: Personalized nutrition management aims to tailor dietary guidance to an individual's intake and phenotype, but most existing systems handle food logging, nutrient analysis and recommendation separately. We present a next-generation mobile nutrition assistant that combines image based meal logging with an LLM driven multi agent controller to provide meal level closed loop support. The system coordinates vision, dialogue and state management agents to estimate nutrients from photos and update a daily intake budget. It then adapts the next meal plan to user preferences and dietary constraints. Experiments with SNAPMe meal images and simulated users show competitive nutrient estimation, personalized menus and efficient task plans. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi agent LLM control for personalized nutrition and reveal open challenges in micronutrient estimation from images and in large scale real world studies.

### [5] [Actively Obtaining Environmental Feedback for Autonomous Action Evaluation Without Predefined Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04235)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model for AI agents to autonomously discover and verify feedback in dynamic environments without relying on predefined measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on predefined feedback signals, which limit applicability in open-ended environments where new actions may require unknown feedback.

Method: Uses action-induced environmental differences to identify unspecified feedback and includes a self-triggering mechanism for autonomous action planning and adjustment.

Result: Experimental results show the active approach significantly improves efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

Conclusion: The model enables agents to proactively acquire feedback, enhancing adaptability in dynamic settings beyond fixed reward systems.

Abstract: Obtaining reliable feedback from the environment is a fundamental capability for intelligent agents to evaluate the correctness of their actions and to accumulate reusable knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification.

### [6] [Autonomous Agents on Blockchains: Standards, Execution Models, and Trust Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04583)
*Saad Alqithami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey analyzes the convergence of AI agents and blockchains, proposing a taxonomy, threat model, capability analysis, interface abstractions, and evaluation benchmarks for secure agent-blockchain interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models enable agentic AI systems for multi-step workflows, while blockchains serve as programmable substrates for value transfer and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence creates a high-stakes challenge to design standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to interact with blockchains safely without exposing users or systems to risks.

Method: A systematic literature review of over 3000 records identified 317 relevant works. The survey contributes a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns (e.g., read-only analytics, autonomous signing), a threat model for agent-driven transaction pipelines, and a comparative capability matrix analyzing over 20 systems across 13 dimensions (e.g., custody models, policy enforcement).

Result: The analysis reveals gaps in the field, leading to a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable goal specification and a Policy Decision Record for auditable policy enforcement. It also proposes a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing safety and robustness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for standardized interfaces and evaluation frameworks to ensure the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution, highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have enabled agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools to execute multi-step workflows, while public blockchains have evolved into a programmable substrate for value transfer, access control, and verifiable state transitions. Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE-32B is a 32B parameter model for agentic reasoning and long-range planning, fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-32B with Iterative Distillation and inverse reasoning, showing improved multi-tool usage in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a language model specialized in agentic reasoning and long-range planning tasks, rather than general conversation fluency, focusing on task decomposition, tool usage, and error recovery.

Method: Initialized from Qwen2.5-32B pretrained model and fine-tuned using Iterative Distillation, a two-stage training process, and introduced an inverse reasoning approach with a meta-cognition head for failure forecasting.

Result: Achieves higher success rates on agentic reasoning benchmarks like MMLU-Pro, AgentBench, and MATH-500 in multi-tool usage scenarios compared to similar-sized baseline models, while staying competitive on standard reasoning evaluations.

Conclusion: SAGE-32B effectively enhances agentic reasoning and planning capabilities through innovative training techniques, with publicly released weights.

Abstract: We demonstrate SAGE-32B, a 32 billion parameter language model that focuses on agentic reasoning and long range planning tasks. Unlike chat models that aim for general conversation fluency, SAGE-32B is designed to operate in an agentic loop, emphasizing task decomposition, tool usage, and error recovery. The model is initialized from the Qwen2.5-32B pretrained model and fine tuned using Iterative Distillation, a two stage training process that improves reasoning performance through rigorously tested feedback loops. SAGE-32B also introduces an inverse reasoning approach, which uses a meta cognition head to forecast potential failures in the planning process before execution. On agentic reasoning benchmarks including MMLU-Pro, AgentBench, and MATH-500, SAGE-32B achieves higher success rates in multi tool usage scenarios compared to similarly sized baseline models, while remaining competitive on standard reasoning evaluations.

### [8] [Adversarial Yet Cooperative: Multi-Perspective Reasoning in Retrieved-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04651)
*Can Xu,Lingyong Yan,Jiayi Wu,Haosen Wang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Yuchen Li,Jizhou Huang,Dawei Yin,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes ARR framework with adversarial reasoning between Reasoner and Verifier using process-aware rewards to enhance multi-step reasoning in retrieval-augmented generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current large reasoning models that operate from single perspectives and rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which restrict deep self-correcting reasoning and provide insufficient training signal for complex multi-step reasoning.

Method: Proposes an Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR) framework with Reasoner and Verifier components that engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and mutual critique, guided by process-aware advantage combining explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The ARR framework effectively enhances reasoning depth and self-correction capabilities in retrieval-augmented generation systems by introducing adversarial reasoning and process-aware rewards.

Abstract: Recent advances in synergizing large reasoning models (LRMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising results, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) reasoning models typically operate from a single, unchallenged perspective, limiting their ability to conduct deep, self-correcting reasoning over external documents, and (2) existing training paradigms rely excessively on outcome-oriented rewards, which provide insufficient signal for shaping the complex, multi-step reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an Reasoner-Verifier framework named Adversarial Reasoning RAG (ARR). The Reasoner and Verifier engage in reasoning on retrieved evidence and critiquing each other's logic while being guided by process-aware advantage that requires no external scoring model. This reward combines explicit observational signals with internal model uncertainty to jointly optimize reasoning fidelity and verification rigor. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

### [9] [Solving Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem by SAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04239)
*Hieu Truong Xuan,Khanh To Van*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First exact SAT-based solver for Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem on general graphs, proving optimality and outperforming heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The CABP is an NP-hard problem crucial for various applications, but prior state-of-the-art methods were only heuristic or metaheuristic, with exact approaches limited to restricted graph classes, necessitating a general exact solver.

Method: The method employs SAT solving with a novel encoding that transforms CABP into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints, using a compact representation to reduce formula size and improve solver efficiency.

Result: SAT-CAB efficiently solves practical CABP instances, discovers new optimal solutions, and proves global optimal values for many benchmarks. It matches or surpasses heuristic solvers like MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, and outperforms commercial CP and MIP solvers on general graphs.

Conclusion: The SAT-CAB approach establishes a new benchmark for exact methods in CABP, advancing the field by enabling global optimality guarantees on general graphs and outperforming heuristic solvers.

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

### [10] [When Single-Agent with Skills Replace Multi-Agent Systems and When They Fail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04748)
*Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Single-agent skill selection offers multi-agent modularity benefits with better efficiency, but exhibits cognitive-like capacity limits that hierarchical organization can address.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether modularity benefits of multi-agent systems can be achieved with a single agent using skill selection, and to understand how skill selection scales as libraries grow, drawing parallels with human cognitive capacity limits.

Method: Viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors, compiling multi-agent systems into single-agent systems, and investigating scaling behavior of skill selection with evidence from hierarchical routing experiments.

Result: Skill selection can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size then drops sharply (phase transition), with semantic confusability among similar skills playing a central role. Hierarchical routing helps mitigate these scaling issues.

Conclusion: Skill selection in LLMs exhibits cognitive-like capacity limits, with hierarchical organization offering a scalable solution. This cognitive-grounded framework provides practical guidance for designing scalable skill-based agents.

Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?
  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.

### [11] [Fuzzy Representation of Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04249)
*Ziba Assadi,Paola Inverardi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A logical framework using SLEEC rules and fuzzy logic to embed ethical requirements in autonomous systems, addressing ethical dilemmas through a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure autonomous systems are trustworthy by adhering to ethical principles and resolving ethical dilemmas they may encounter.

Method: Logical representation of SLEEC rules using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic.

Result: The approach is illustrated through a case study, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach using SLEEC rules, test-score semantics, and fuzzy logic effectively addresses ethical dilemmas in autonomous systems, providing a practical and comprehensive framework for embedding ethical requirements.

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.

### [12] [Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection via Tool Result Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04795)
*Qiang Yu,Xinran Cheng,Chuanyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight tool result parsing plus malicious code filtering method for LLM agents reduces indirect prompt injection attack success rates to new lows while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional indirect prompt injection defenses face major issues like high computational costs (trained detection models) or high attack success rates (prompt engineering methods), creating serious risks as LLMs gain physical control capabilities.

Method: A novel approach combining tool result parsing to provide precise data to LLMs while filtering out injected malicious code, without requiring dedicated detection models or extensive prompt engineering.

Result: The approach maintains competitive Utility under Attack while achieving the lowest Attack Success Rate to date, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed tool result parsing method with malicious code filtering significantly reduces ASR while maintaining acceptable UA, making it a strong lightweight defense against evolving indirect prompt injection threats in physical LLM agents.

Abstract: As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods. Code is available at GitHub.

### [13] [Scaling Trends for Multi-Hop Contextual Reasoning in Mid-Scale Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04254)
*Brady Steele,Micah Katz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A controlled study shows task-method dissociations in multi-hop contextual reasoning: rule-based methods excel at structured retrieval but fail at reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show inverse performance, with gains depending on base capability, active parameters, and architecture quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models and demonstrate task-method dissociation (e.g., rule-based pattern matching vs. LLM-based multi-agent systems), while evaluating factors like base capability, active parameters, and architecture quality.

Method: Used a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B) to compare rule-based pattern matching and LLM-based multi-agent systems in tasks such as structured information retrieval and cross-document reasoning.

Result: Rule-based pattern matching achieved 100% success on structured retrieval but only 6.7% on reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems showed up to 80% success on reasoning tasks. Key findings include: multi-agent gains depend on base capability (significant for LLaMA-3 8B and Mixtral), active parameters predict performance (Mixtral's ~12B active parameters aligned with results), and architecture quality matters (LLaMA-3 8B outperformed LLaMA-2 13B).

Conclusion: Results provide controlled evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, highlighting that multi-agent benefits rely on base model capability. The evaluation framework is released for reproducible research.

Abstract: We present a controlled study of multi-hop contextual reasoning in large language models, providing a clean demonstration of the task-method dissociation: rule-based pattern matching achieves 100% success on structured information retrieval but only 6.7% on tasks requiring cross-document reasoning, while LLM-based multi-agent systems show the inverse pattern, achieving up to 80% on reasoning tasks where rule-based methods fail. Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability. We release our evaluation framework to support reproducible research on reasoning in mid-scale models.

### [14] [Cross-Language Speaker Attribute Prediction Using MIL and RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04257)
*Sunny Shu,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMIL-DAT combines instance selection and domain adversarial training for multilingual speaker attribute prediction, showing consistent performance gains across languages and settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages, proposing an approach that effectively handles these challenges across various languages and resource settings.

Method: RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. The approach was evaluated on a five-language Twitter corpus in a few-shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero-shot setting for gender and age prediction.

Result: Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. In the zero-shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains.

Conclusion: Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross-lingual speaker attribute prediction.

Abstract: We study multilingual speaker attribute prediction under linguistic variation, domain mismatch, and data imbalance across languages. We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction.

### [15] [Towards a Mechanistic Understanding of Propositional Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04260)
*Danchun Chen,Qiyao Yan,Liangming Pan*

TL;DR: LLMs use structured computational strategies for propositional logic reasoning involving staged layer-wise processing, information flow management, persistent fact re-access, and specialized attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform logical reasoning internally by identifying the computational strategies they employ, rather than just identifying task-specific circuits as done in prior studies.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning.

Result: Revealed a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation, Information Transmission, Fact Retrospection, and Specialized Attention Heads, which generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths.

Conclusion: The study provides mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning through four interlocking mechanisms that generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths.

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform logical reasoning internally remains a fundamental challenge. While prior mechanistic studies focus on identifying taskspecific circuits, they leave open the question of what computational strategies LLMs employ for propositional reasoning. We address this gap through comprehensive analysis of Qwen3 (8B and 14B) on PropLogic-MI, a controlled dataset spanning 11 propositional logic rule categories across one-hop and two-hop reasoning. Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning.

### [16] [Systems Explaining Systems: A Framework for Intelligence and Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04269)
*Sean Niklas Semmler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intelligence emerges from relational structures rather than prediction; consciousness arises when recursive systems interpret their own cognitive processes through systems-explaining-systems principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explain intelligence and consciousness as emerging from relational structure rather than prediction or domain-specific mechanisms, inspired by the need for more efficient representations and deeper understanding of cognitive phenomena.

Method: The paper establishes a conceptual framework defining intelligence through relational structure and causal connections, introduces the systems-explaining-systems principle for consciousness emergence, and analyzes how recursive architectures create self-models through context enrichment and dynamic stabilization.

Result: The framework defines intelligence as capacity to form/integrate causal connections, introduces systems-explaining-systems principle for consciousness emergence, shows how recursive architectures create internal models of cognitive processes rather than just external world representations, and reframes predictive processing.

Conclusion: The framework proposes consciousness emerges from recursive self-modeling where higher-order systems interpret lower-order relational patterns. This reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence rather than explicit forecasting and suggests recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for achieving human-like artificial intelligence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

### [17] [Correcting Autonomous Driving Object Detection Misclassifications with Automated Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04271)
*Keegan Kimbrell,Wang Tianhao,Feng Chen,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining automated commonsense reasoning with AV perception to handle rare, uncertain road scenarios, showing improved detection of traffic lights and obstructions in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that despite extensive research, SAE Level 5 AVs are not yet commercially available, mainly due to over-reliance on machine learning. They believe integrating automated commonsense reasoning can help achieve full autonomy, especially in rare or abnormal road scenarios where training data is insufficient.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid model that integrates automated commonsense reasoning with the AV's perception module, employing a mechanism to invoke reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model. They implement and test this in the CARLA simulator across two scenarios—failed traffic lights and unexpected road obstructions—to correct perception errors.

Result: The commonsense reasoning-based solution successfully detects traffic light colors and obstacles that the AV's perception model initially missed, demonstrating improved accuracy when handling the considered abnormal road scenarios in the CARLA simulator.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV object detection misclassifications and highlights hybrid models as an effective approach to improving AV perception, suggesting a pathway toward achieving SAE Level 5 autonomy.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has been heavily researched and sought after, yet there are no SAE Level 5 AVs available today in the marketplace. We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.

*Sanderson Molick,Vaishak Belle*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a modal logic for abduction by extending Levesque's only-knowing logic with abductive operators and preferential relations, creating a well-behaved non-monotonic framework for abductive reasoning with epistemic states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide an alternative approach to abduction that uses a modal vocabulary and explores the relationship between abductive reasoning and epistemic states, specifically the concept of only-knowing, while also addressing the need for selection methods in abduction.

Method: The paper extends Levesque logic of only-knowing with abductive modal operators, which are defined using epistemic concepts. Then it incorporates preferential relations into modal frames to create a non-monotonic extension capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations.

Result: The paper develops a basic logic for knowledge and abduction with abductive modal operators, creates a non-monotonic extension using preferential relations, and demonstrates that this framework supports well-behaved non-monotonic consequence relations suitable for abductive reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes a modal approach to abduction through a combination of epistemic and preferential semantics, creating a well-behaved formal framework that connects abductive reasoning with epistemic states and provides a foundation for exploring non-monotonic consequence relations.

Abstract: The paper introduces a basic logic of knowledge and abduction by extending Levesque logic of only-knowing with an abduction modal operator defined via the combination of basic epistemic concepts. The upshot is an alternative approach to abduction that employs a modal vocabulary and explores the relation between abductive reasoning and epistemic states of only knowing. Furthermore, by incorporating a preferential relation into modal frames, we provide a non-monotonic extension of our basic framework capable of expressing different selection methods for abductive explanations. Core metatheoretic properties of non-monotonic consequence relations are explored within this setting and shown to provide a well-behaved foundation for abductive reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes using Hybrid MKNF for knowledge representation in aeronautics, addressing expressivity and efficiency challenges, with proposed heuristics for integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aeronautics applications require high expressivity to model complex knowledge and efficient reasoning with low resource usage, but integrating rules and ontologies effectively is challenging.

Method: Adopt Hybrid MKNF KR language for its seamless rule-ontology integration; evaluate via a case study in aeronautics to assess suitability and identify needed features.

Result: Hybrid MKNF shows promise, but additional expressivity features are needed for aeronautics; proposed heuristics to integrate these into the Hybrid MKNF framework.

Conclusion: Integrating Hybrid MKNF with heuristics can enhance knowledge representation in aeronautics, balancing expressivity and efficiency for practical applications.

Abstract: The deployment of knowledge representation and reasoning technologies in aeronautics applications presents two main challenges: achieving sufficient expressivity to capture complex domain knowledge, and executing reasoning tasks efficiently while minimizing memory usage and computational overhead. An effective strategy for attaining necessary expressivity involves integrating two fundamental KR concepts: rules and ontologies. This study adopts the well-established KR language Hybrid MKNF owing to its seamless integration of rules and ontologies through its semantics and query answering capabilities. We evaluated Hybrid MKNF to assess its suitability in the aeronautics domain through a concrete case study. We identified additional  expressivity features  that are crucial for developing aeronautics applications and proposed a set of heuristics to support their integration into Hybrid MKNF framework.

*Stuti Sinha,Himanshu Kumar,Aryan Raju Mandapati,Rakshit Sakhuja,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language choice in LLM negotiation evaluations, especially English vs. Indic languages, significantly affects outcomes, highlighting the need for multilingual and culturally-aware assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM negotiation almost exclusively occur in English, potentially biasing results, so studying language effects is crucial.

Method: Controlled simulations across multiple games (Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, Resource Exchange) with consistent rules, parameters, and incentives in English and four Indic languages.

Result: Language choice shifts outcomes more than model changes, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus, with task-contingent effects.

Conclusion: English-only evaluation yields incomplete and misleading conclusions, emphasizing the importance of culturally-aware evaluation for fair LLM deployment.

Abstract: Negotiation is a core component of social intelligence, requiring agents to balance strategic reasoning, cooperation, and social norms. Recent work shows that LLMs can engage in multi-turn negotiation, yet nearly all evaluations occur exclusively in English. Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed adaptive system for customer chat clustering segments chats into service concerns and incrementally refines clusters using LLM-based splitting only when quality degrades, achieving major improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods for customer chat data struggle with overlapping concerns, create broad static clusters that degrade over time, and require disruptive full reclustering that interrupts issue tracking continuity.

Method: An adaptive system segments multi-turn chats into service-specific concerns, then incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. It monitors cluster quality via Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Scores. LLM-based splitting is selectively applied only to degraded clusters to maintain quality.

Result: The method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100% and reduces DBI by 65.6% compared to baseline approaches, enabling scalable real-time analytics without requiring full reclustering.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive clustering system effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional methods for customer chat data analysis, providing a scalable, real-time solution that maintains high cluster quality and operational continuity without periodic full reclustering.

Abstract: Clustering customer chat data is vital for cloud providers handling multi service queries. Traditional methods struggle with overlapping concerns and create broad, static clusters that degrade over time. Reclustering disrupts continuity, making issue tracking difficult. We propose an adaptive system that segments multi turn chats into service specific concerns and incrementally refines clusters as new issues arise. Cluster quality is tracked via DaviesBouldin Index and Silhouette Scores, with LLM based splitting applied only to degraded clusters. Our method improves Silhouette Scores by over 100\% and reduces DBI by 65.6\% compared to baselines, enabling scalable, real time analytics without full reclustering.

TL;DR: SciFig is an AI agent system that generates publication-ready figures from research paper texts using hierarchical layout generation and iterative feedback, with high performance in quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Figure generation for scientific papers is manual and time-consuming, requiring domain knowledge and design skills.

Method: Hierarchical layout generation parses texts to identify component relationships and groups elements into functional modules; iterative CoT feedback improves layouts; rubric-based evaluation analyzes real figures.

Result: Achieves 70.1% overall quality on dataset-level and 66.2% on paper-specific evaluation, with high scores in visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy.

Conclusion: SciFig automates figure generation effectively, outperforming manual methods, and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Creating high-quality figures and visualizations for scientific papers is a time-consuming task that requires both deep domain knowledge and professional design skills. Despite over 2.5 million scientific papers published annually, the figure generation process remains largely manual. We introduce $\textbf{SciFig}$, an end-to-end AI agent system that generates publication-ready pipeline figures directly from research paper texts. SciFig uses a hierarchical layout generation strategy, which parses research descriptions to identify component relationships, groups related elements into functional modules, and generates inter-module connections to establish visual organization. Furthermore, an iterative chain-of-thought (CoT) feedback mechanism progressively improves layouts through multiple rounds of visual analysis and reasoning. We introduce a rubric-based evaluation framework that analyzes 2,219 real scientific figures to extract evaluation rubrics and automatically generates comprehensive evaluation criteria. SciFig demonstrates remarkable performance: achieving 70.1$\%$ overall quality on dataset-level evaluation and 66.2$\%$ on paper-specific evaluation, and consistently high scores across metrics such as visual clarity, structural organization, and scientific accuracy. SciFig figure generation pipeline and our evaluation benchmark will be open-sourced.

### [25] [Assessing the quality and coherence of word embeddings after SCM-based intersectional bias mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04393)
*Eren Kocadag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores methods to reduce intersectional social biases in static word embeddings, assessing three debiasing strategies across embedding families while balancing semantic utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases that can influence downstream systems, and prior work using the Stereotype Content Model has mainly addressed single-group bias; this study extends to intersectional bias by examining compound social identity pairs.

Method: The authors build compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. They evaluate these on Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch embeddings using local neighborhood coherence and analogy behavior.

Result: Across models, SCM-based debiasing performs well in intersectional cases and preserves the semantic landscape. Methods maintaining geometry best are cautious with analogies, while more assertive projections improve analogies at the cost of neighborhood stability; Partial Projection is conservative, Linear Projection more assertive, and Subtraction remains competitive, with aggregation choice depending on embedding family and goals.

Conclusion: Intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, providing guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing methods to balance stability against analogy performance.

Abstract: Static word embeddings often absorb social biases from the text they learn from, and those biases can quietly shape downstream systems. Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.

*Forest Mars*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transitive Expert Error (TEE), where domain experts make systematic errors at domain boundaries due to biases like structural similarity and authority persistence, which also apply to AI systems like routing architectures, with proposed interventions for detection and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why domain experts, despite their calibrated expertise, fail at the boundaries of their domains, and to extend this analysis to AI systems to prevent similar errors.

Method: The study examines cognitive mechanisms in human experts and analogies to AI routing architectures (e.g., MoE systems, RAG), identifying core biases and conditions that intensify errors.

Result: Identified two core mechanisms (structural similarity bias and authority persistence) that cause errors at domain boundaries, with conditions like shared vocabulary and delayed feedback. These lead to hallucination-like outputs in AI systems, such as routing-induced failures.

Conclusion: TEE is a pervasive issue in both human and AI systems, but in AI, it can be mitigated through architectural interventions like multi-expert activation and boundary-aware calibration, making intractable human errors addressable.

Abstract: Domain expertise enhances judgment within boundaries but creates systematic vulnerabilities specifically at borders. We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design.

*Linzhang Li,Yixin Dong,Guanjie Wang,Ziyi Xu,Alexander Jiang,Tianqi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: XGrammar 2 is a highly optimized engine for dynamic structured generation in LLM agents, using new dispatching semantics and optimizations to achieve over 6x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM agents need to handle increasingly complex and dynamic structured generation tasks like tool calling and conditional structured generation, which current structured generation engines struggle with.

Method: Develops a new dynamic dispatching semantics (TagDispatch), a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method, a cross-grammar caching mechanism, extends mask generation to an Earley-parser-based algorithm, and designs a repetition compression algorithm.

Result: Achieves more than 6x speedup over existing structured generation engines and handles dynamic tasks with near-zero overhead when integrated with an LLM inference engine.

Conclusion: XGrammar 2 establishes a new state-of-the-art for dynamic structured generation engines, significantly improving speed and flexibility for modern LLM agents.

Abstract: Modern LLM agents are required to handle increasingly complex structured generation tasks, such as tool calling and conditional structured generation. These tasks are significantly more dynamic than predefined structures, posing new challenges to the current structured generation engines. In this paper, we propose XGrammar 2, a highly optimized structured generation engine for agentic LLMs. XGrammar 2 accelerates the mask generation for these dynamic structured generation tasks through a new dynamic dispatching semantics: TagDispatch. We further introduce a just-in-time (JIT) compilation method to reduce compilation time and a cross-grammar caching mechanism to leverage the common sub-structures across different grammars. Additionally, we extend the previous PDA-based mask generation algorithm to the Earley-parser-based one and design a repetition compression algorithm to handle repetition structures in grammars. Evaluation results show that XGrammar 2 can achieve more than 6x speedup over the existing structured generation engines. Integrated with an LLM inference engine, XGrammar 2 can handle dynamic structured generation tasks with near-zero overhead.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Categorical framework for belief propagation (BP) using hypergraph categories, Grothendieck fibrations for message-passing, and sheaf theory to unify exact/loopy inference, with HATCC algorithm for exact inference via holonomy detection and augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a categorical foundation unifying belief propagation algorithms (tree exactness, junction trees, loopy BP failures) and develop efficient exact inference methods.

Method: Construct free hypergraph category Syn_Σ on typed signature; use Grothendieck fibration ∫Msg → FG_Σ for message-passing; characterize exact inference as effective descent; introduce HATCC algorithm to detect descent obstructions via holonomy computation, compile into mode variables, and reduce to tree BP on augmented graph.

Result: Framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions; HATCC achieves exact inference with complexity O(n² d_max + c·k_max·δ_max³ + n·δ_max²), showing significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs, random graphs, and UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

Conclusion: Categorical and sheaf-theoretic approach successfully formalizes belief propagation, enabling efficient exact inference via holonomy-aware methods, with practical benefits in speed and accuracy over traditional algorithms.

Abstract: We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \(\Syn_Σ\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \(\cat{Mat}_R\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \(\int\Msg \to \cat{FG}_Σ\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \(O(n^2 d_{\max} + c \cdot k_{\max} \cdot δ_{\max}^3 + n \cdot δ_{\max}^2)\) for \(n\) factors and \(c\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.

TL;DR: AI regulation requires computational compliance algorithms, not traditional methods. The paper specifies design goals and a benchmark to measure performance for this new research domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems cannot comply with forthcoming AI regulations at the required speed and scale using traditional analogue compliance methods.

Method: The authors specify design goals for computational AIR compliance algorithms and create a benchmark dataset to quantitatively measure algorithm performance against these goals.

Result: The paper delivers a blueprint including design goals for compliance algorithms and a benchmark dataset, establishing foundations for a new research domain in computational AIR compliance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that traditional compliance methods are insufficient for AI regulation, proposing computational compliance algorithms as the necessary solution. It presents design goals and a benchmark dataset to guide and evaluate this new research domain, aiming to spark necessary investment.

Abstract: The era of AI regulation (AIR) is upon us. But AI systems, we argue, will not be able to comply with these regulations at the necessary speed and scale by continuing to rely on traditional, analogue methods of compliance. Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals. By delivering this blueprint, we hope to give shape to an important but uncrystallized new domain of research - and, in doing so, incite necessary investment in it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in exploratory GUI testing: high manual costs, goal-oriented masking where agents prioritize task completion over defect reporting, and execution-bias attribution where system defects are misidentified as agent errors.

Method: Proposes GUITester, a multi-agent framework with a Planning-Execution Module (PEM) for proactive defect probing and a Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM) for resolving execution-bias attribution.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that autonomous exploratory GUI testing is feasible and demonstrates GUITester's superior performance, laying a foundation for future GUI quality assurance.

Abstract: Exploratory GUI testing is essential for software quality but suffers from high manual costs. While Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents excel in navigation, they fail to autonomously discover defects due to two core challenges: \textit{Goal-Oriented Masking}, where agents prioritize task completion over reporting anomalies, and \textit{Execution-Bias Attribution}, where system defects are misidentified as agent errors. To address these, we first introduce \textbf{GUITestBench}, the first interactive benchmark for this task, featuring 143 tasks across 26 defects. We then propose \textbf{GUITester}, a multi-agent framework that decouples navigation from verification via two modules: (i) a \textit{Planning-Execution Module (PEM)} that proactively probes for defects via embedded testing intents, and (ii) a \textit{Hierarchical Reflection Module (HRM)} that resolves attribution ambiguity through interaction history analysis. GUITester achieves an F1-score of 48.90\% (Pass@3) on GUITestBench, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (33.35\%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of autonomous exploratory testing and provides a robust foundation for future GUI quality assurance~\footnote{Our code is now available in~\href{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}{https://github.com/ADaM-BJTU/GUITestBench}}.

*Jingyi Wang,Fanggang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active learning-enhanced SEI method using three-stage semi-supervised training (contrastive learning, joint loss optimization, AL selection) achieves higher accuracy with less labeled data compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specific emitter identification (SEI) is crucial for communication security but faces the challenge of requiring large-scale labeled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain.

Method: A three-stage semi-supervised training scheme: (1) self-supervised contrastive learning with dynamic dictionary update for robust representation extraction from unlabeled data, (2) supervised training with joint optimization of contrastive and cross-entropy losses on small labeled dataset, and (3) active learning module selecting valuable samples based on uncertainty and representativeness criteria.

Result: Experimental results on ADS-B and WiFi datasets show the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

Conclusion: The proposed AL-enhanced SEI approach effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data by combining self-supervised contrastive learning, supervised training with joint loss optimization, and active learning for sample selection. This three-stage semi-supervised training scheme significantly improves recognition accuracy while reducing labeling costs, making it a practical solution for communication security in wireless systems.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.

### [32] [The Forgotten Shield: Safety Grafting in Parameter-Space for Medical MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04199)
*Jiale Zhao,Xing Mou,Jinlin Wu,Hongyuan Yu,Mingrui Sun,Yang Shi,Xuanwu Yin,Zhen Chen,Zhen Lei,Yaohua Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a safety evaluation framework for Medical MLLMs, identifies vulnerabilities like cross-modality jailbreaks, proposes Parameter-Space Intervention to improve safety during medical fine-tuning, and shows it enhances safety without harming medical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models have advanced in medical tasks, but their safety research is lacking, creating risks for real-world use, necessitating a systematic assessment and solution.

Method: Establish a multidimensional safety evaluation framework, reveal vulnerabilities, propose Parameter-Space Intervention to extract and inject safety knowledge from base models, and use a fine-grained parameter search algorithm.

Result: The approach significantly improves safety guardrails against attacks without additional safety data and minimizes degradation to core medical performance in experiments.

Conclusion: The paper addresses safety gaps in Medical MLLMs through a novel intervention method, offering an effective trade-off between safety and medical utility to enable safer deployment.

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Medical MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in specialized medical tasks; however, research into their safety has lagged, posing potential risks for real-world deployment. In this paper, we first establish a multidimensional evaluation framework to systematically benchmark the safety of current SOTA Medical MLLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across both general and medical-specific safety dimensions in existing models, particularly highlighting their fragility against cross-modality jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we find that the medical fine-tuning process frequently induces catastrophic forgetting of the model's original safety alignment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel "Parameter-Space Intervention" approach for efficient safety re-alignment. This method extracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from original base models and concurrently injects them into the target model during the construction of medical capabilities. Additionally, we design a fine-grained parameter search algorithm to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety and medical performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bolsters the safety guardrails of Medical MLLMs without relying on additional domain-specific safety data, while minimizing degradation to core medical performance.

*Ben Carvell,George De Ath,Eseoghene Benjamin,Richard Everson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online action-stacking compiles bursts of primitive RL actions into realistic ATC commands, achieving comparable performance with much smaller action spaces while reducing instruction frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To produce realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space, bridging the gap between standard RL formulations and operational ATC requirements.

Method: Online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for RL policies trained with Proximal Policy Optimisation on the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, using simple incremental heading or level adjustments with action-damping penalty.

Result: In lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions.

Conclusion: Online action-stacking helps bridge the gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.

### [34] [Green MLOps: Closed-Loop, Energy-Aware Inference with NVIDIA Triton, FastAPI, and Bio-Inspired Thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04250)
*Mustapha Hamdi,Mourad Jabou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bio-inspired framework for energy-efficient AI inference by mapping protein-folding energy basins to cost landscapes and using a closed-loop threshold to optimize utility-to-energy trade-offs, reducing processing time by 42% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency is crucial in AI deployment, as inference often has a larger cumulative carbon impact than training, necessitating methods to reduce energy consumption during long-running inference.

Method: The paper proposes a bio-inspired framework that models inference cost landscapes based on protein-folding energy basins, controlled by a decaying, closed-loop threshold that admits requests only when the utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable. It was evaluated using DistilBERT and ResNet-18 with FastAPI, ONNX Runtime, and NVIDIA Triton on RTX 4000 Ada GPU.

Result: Ablation studies show the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set) compared to standard open-loop execution, with accuracy degradation below 0.5%, and defines efficiency boundaries between lightweight serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton).

Conclusion: The research connects biophysical energy models to Green MLOps, offering a practical, auditable basis for implementing closed-loop energy-aware inference in production environments.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is a first-order concern in AI deployment, as long-running inference can exceed training in cumulative carbon impact. We propose a bio-inspired framework that maps protein-folding energy basins to inference cost landscapes and controls execution via a decaying, closed-loop threshold. A request is admitted only when the expected utility-to-energy trade-off is favorable (high confidence/utility at low marginal energy and congestion), biasing operation toward the first acceptable local basin rather than pursuing costly global minima. We evaluate DistilBERT and ResNet-18 served through FastAPI with ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA Triton on an RTX 4000 Ada GPU. Our ablation study reveals that the bio-controller reduces processing time by 42% compared to standard open-loop execution (0.50s vs 0.29s on A100 test set), with a minimal accuracy degradation (<0.5%). Furthermore, we establish the efficiency boundaries between lightweight local serving (ORT) and managed batching (Triton). The results connect biophysical energy models to Green MLOps and offer a practical, auditable basis for closed-loop energy-aware inference in production.

### [35] [Safety-Utility Conflicts Are Not Global: Surgical Alignment via Head-Level Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04262)
*Wang Cai,Yilin Wen,Jinchang Hou,Du Su,Guoqiu Wang,Zhonghou Lv,Chenfu Bao,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST is a framework that addresses safety alignment conflicts in LLMs by identifying high-conflict attention heads and selectively skipping them during fine-tuning, improving safety-utility trade-offs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the multi-objective optimization conflict in safety alignment of LLMs, which causes unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies fail to account for Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, where functional sensitivity and conflict levels vary substantially across different attention heads.

Method: The authors propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), which integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. This involves constructing a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity to guide selective parameter updates, specifically skipping 'high-conflict' heads during training.

Result: Experiments show that alignment conflicts are not uniformly distributed in LLMs, and the drop in general capabilities primarily comes from updating a small group of 'high-conflict' heads. By selectively skipping these heads during training, the framework significantly reduces capability loss without compromising safety.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that safety alignment in LLMs presents a multi-objective optimization conflict that causes degradation of general capabilities. The proposed CAST framework addresses this by identifying and selectively updating parameters based on head-level conflict mapping, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient solution.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently presents a multi-objective optimization conflict, often accompanied by an unintended degradation of general capabilities. Existing mitigation strategies typically rely on global gradient geometry to resolve these conflicts, yet they overlook Modular Heterogeneity within Transformers, specifically that the functional sensitivity and degree of conflict vary substantially across different attention heads. Such global approaches impose uniform update rules across all parameters, often resulting in suboptimal trade-offs by indiscriminately updating utility sensitive heads that exhibit intense gradient conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose Conflict-Aware Sparse Tuning (CAST), a framework that integrates head-level diagnosis with sparse fine-tuning. CAST first constructs a pre-alignment conflict map by synthesizing Optimization Conflict and Functional Sensitivity, which then guides the selective update of parameters. Experiments reveal that alignment conflicts in LLMs are not uniformly distributed. We find that the drop in general capabilities mainly comes from updating a small group of ``high-conflict'' heads. By simply skipping these heads during training, we significantly reduce this loss without compromising safety, offering an interpretable and parameter-efficient approach to improving the safety-utility trade-off.

### [36] [Learning to Reason: Temporal Saliency Distillation for Interpretable Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04263)
*Nilushika Udayangani Hewa Dehigahawattage,Kishor Nandakishor,Marimuthu Palaniswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Temporal Saliency Distillation (TSD) for time series knowledge distillation, transferring interpretable temporal importance from teacher to student to improve performance and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods in time series, borrowed from computer vision (logit/feature aligning), lack interpretability and fail to transfer sufficient reasoning knowledge, leading to student models that can't safely replace teachers due to differing predictive distributions.

Method: Extends logit transfer to include temporal saliency, which captures the importance of each input timestep in the teacher's prediction, and trains the student using Temporal Saliency Distillation to align reasoning without extra parameters or architectural changes.

Result: TSD improves baseline performance and achieves properties beyond predictive accuracy, enhancing interpretability and trustworthiness in student models.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis by focusing on temporal reasoning transfer.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has proven effective for model compression by transferring knowledge from a larger network called the teacher to a smaller network called the student. Current knowledge distillation in time series is predominantly based on logit and feature aligning techniques originally developed for computer vision tasks. These methods do not explicitly account for temporal data and fall short in two key aspects. First, the mechanisms by which the transferred knowledge helps the student model learning process remain unclear due to uninterpretability of logits and features. Second, these methods transfer only limited knowledge, primarily replicating the teacher predictive accuracy. As a result, student models often produce predictive distributions that differ significantly from those of their teachers, hindering their safe substitution for teacher models. In this work, we propose transferring interpretable knowledge by extending conventional logit transfer to convey not just the right prediction but also the right reasoning of the teacher. Specifically, we induce other useful knowledge from the teacher logits termed temporal saliency which captures the importance of each input timestep to the teacher prediction. By training the student with Temporal Saliency Distillation we encourage it to make predictions based on the same input features as the teacher. Temporal Saliency Distillation requires no additional parameters or architecture specific assumptions. We demonstrate that Temporal Saliency Distillation effectively improves the performance of baseline methods while also achieving desirable properties beyond predictive accuracy. We hope our work establishes a new paradigm for interpretable knowledge distillation in time series analysis.

*Nilushika Udayangani,Kishor Nandakishor,Marimuthu Palaniswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MemKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework for creating compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks tailored for time series analysis by addressing temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models like recurrent neural networks are effective for time series but computationally heavy, hindering deployment in resource-limited settings like wearable devices. Existing knowledge distillation methods ignore time series-specific temporal patterns and memory retention.

Method: Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD) uses a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between teacher and student models across subsequences, ensuring the student mimics teacher behavior effectively.

Result: Extensive experiments show MemKD outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods, reducing parameter size and memory usage by about 500 times while maintaining performance comparable to the teacher model.

Conclusion: MemKD offers a practical solution for deploying efficient, real-time time series models in constrained environments, advancing knowledge distillation for temporal data.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and their variants, such as long short-term memory, have significantly advanced time series data analysis. These models capture complex, sequential patterns in time series, enabling real-time assessments. However, their high computational complexity and large model sizes pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as wearable devices and edge computing platforms. Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), thereby retaining high performance while reducing computational demands. Current KD methods, originally designed for computer vision tasks, neglect the unique temporal dependencies and memory retention characteristics of time series models. To this end, we propose a novel KD framework termed Memory-Discrepancy Knowledge Distillation (MemKD). MemKD leverages a specialized loss function to capture memory retention discrepancies between the teacher and student models across subsequences within time series data, ensuring that the student model effectively mimics the teacher model's behaviour. This approach facilitates the development of compact, high-performing recurrent neural networks suitable for real-time, time series analysis tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MemKD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods. It reduces parameter size and memory usage by approximately 500 times while maintaining comparable performance to the teacher model.

*Pritthijit Nath,Sebastian Schemm,Henry Moss,Peter Haynes,Emily Shuckburgh,Mark J. Webb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL framework learns adaptive climate parametrisations online, outperforming static methods across multiple testbeds with TQC, DDPG, and TD3 showing best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional parametrisation schemes in weather and climate models rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics.

Method: This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online using reinforcement learning (RL) across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds: simple climate bias correction (SCBC), radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. The study evaluated nine RL algorithms.

Result: TQC, DDPG, and TD3 achieved the highest skill and most stable convergence. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning, especially in tropical and mid-latitude bands. Federated RL enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE. Learnt corrections were physically meaningful: agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments.

Conclusion: Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

Abstract: Weather and climate models rely on parametrisations to represent unresolved sub-grid processes. Traditional schemes rely on fixed coefficients that are weakly constrained and tuned offline, contributing to persistent biases that limit their ability to adapt to the underlying physics. This study presents a framework that learns components of parametrisation schemes online as a function of the evolving model state using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluates the resulting RL-driven parameter updates across a hierarchy of idealised testbeds spanning a simple climate bias correction (SCBC), a radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and a zonal mean energy balance model (EBM) with both single-agent and federated multi-agent settings. Across nine RL algorithms, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) achieved the highest skill and the most stable convergence across configurations, with performance assessed against a static baseline using area-weighted RMSE, temperature profile and pressure-level diagnostics. For the EBM, single-agent RL outperformed static parameter tuning with the strongest gains in tropical and mid-latitude bands, while federated RL on multi-agent setups enabled geographically specialised control and faster convergence, with a six-agent DDPG configuration using frequent aggregation yielding the lowest area-weighted RMSE across the tropics and mid-latitudes. The learnt corrections were also physically meaningful as agents modulated EBM radiative parameters to reduce meridional biases, adjusted RCE lapse rates to match vertical temperature errors, and stabilised SCBC heating increments to limit drift. Overall, results highlight RL to deliver skilful state-dependent, and regime-aware parametrisations, offering a scalable pathway for online learning within numerical models.

*Anherutowa Calvo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing predictable gradient manifolds in deep learning optimization, introducing prediction-based path length and predictable rank to characterize temporal structure and improve convergence guarantees, with empirical validation across various models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning gradients often exhibit temporal predictability and low-dimensional structure not captured by worst-case bounds, prompting the need for a measurable framework to formalize these observations and refine optimization analysis.

Method: Introduce two computable quantities: prediction-based path length to measure gradient forecastability from past information, and predictable rank to quantify the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments; apply these across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, using lightweight random projections for diagnosis.

Result: Gradient trajectories are found to be locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time, with these properties stable across architectures and optimizers, enabling restatement of classical optimization guarantees to depend explicitly on these quantities.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unifying perspective on optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime and suggesting new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design based on measurable training properties.

Abstract: Deep learning optimization exhibits structure that is not captured by worst-case gradient bounds. Empirically, gradients along training trajectories are often temporally predictable and evolve within a low-dimensional subspace. In this work we formalize this observation through a measurable framework for predictable gradient manifolds.
  We introduce two computable quantities: a prediction-based path length that measures how well gradients can be forecast from past information, and a predictable rank that quantifies the intrinsic temporal dimension of gradient increments. We show how classical online and nonconvex optimization guarantees can be restated so that convergence and regret depend explicitly on these quantities, rather than on worst-case variation.
  Across convolutional networks, vision transformers, language models, and synthetic control tasks, we find that gradient trajectories are locally predictable and exhibit strong low-rank structure over time. These properties are stable across architectures and optimizers, and can be diagnosed directly from logged gradients using lightweight random projections.
  Our results provide a unifying lens for understanding optimization dynamics in modern deep learning, reframing standard training as operating in a low-complexity temporal regime. This perspective suggests new directions for adaptive optimizers, rank-aware tracking, and prediction-based algorithm design grounded in measurable properties of real training runs.

### [40] [Unlocking the Pre-Trained Model as a Dual-Alignment Calibrator for Post-Trained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04277)
*Beier Luo,Cheng Wang,Hongxin Wei,Sharon Li,Xuefeng Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual-Align is an unsupervised post-hoc framework for calibrating post-trained LLMs by aligning both final confidence distributions and intermediate inference processes to correct overconfidence drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training worsens confidence calibration in large language models, causing systematic overconfidence, but existing methods treat calibration as static output matching, ignoring inference-time dynamics like confidence and process drifts.

Method: Developed Dual-Align, a framework that performs confidence alignment via final-distribution matching and process alignment by identifying divergence points in intermediate layers and realigning inference stability, using a single temperature parameter.

Result: Dual-Align reduced calibration errors more effectively than baselines, approaching a supervised oracle's performance without sacrificing post-training gains.

Conclusion: Accounting for both confidence and process drift through dual alignment significantly improves calibration in post-trained LLMs, offering a practical unsupervised solution.

Abstract: Post-training improves large language models (LLMs) but often worsens confidence calibration, leading to systematic overconfidence. Recent unsupervised post-hoc methods for post-trained LMs (PoLMs) mitigate this by aligning PoLM confidence to that of well-calibrated pre-trained counterparts. However, framing calibration as static output-distribution matching overlooks the inference-time dynamics introduced by post-training. In particular, we show that calibration errors arise from two regimes: (i) confidence drift, where final confidence inflates despite largely consistent intermediate decision processes, and (ii) process drift, where intermediate inference pathways diverge. Guided by this diagnosis, we propose Dual-Align, an unsupervised post-hoc framework for dual alignment in confidence calibration. Dual-Align performs confidence alignment to correct confidence drift via final-distribution matching, and introduces process alignment to address process drift by locating the layer where trajectories diverge and realigning the stability of subsequent inference. This dual strategy learns a single temperature parameter that corrects both drift types without sacrificing post-training performance gains. Experiments show consistent improvements over baselines, reducing calibration errors and approaching a supervised oracle.

Motivation: To address data scarcity and privacy issues in air transport by generating realistic synthetic time series of airport delays from large datasets in Europe and the US.

Method: Comparison of three models: two based on state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms and one using a simplified Genetic Algorithm, applied to time series data of airport delays.

Result: The simplified Genetic Algorithm generates synthetic time series almost indistinguishable from real ones while maintaining high variability, and was validated effectively in a delay propagation detection problem.

Conclusion: The Genetic Algorithm approach is effective for creating realistic synthetic delay data, which is made available to the scientific community for further research and applications in air transport.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, thanks to its ability to solve problems like data scarcity and privacy, and is starting to find applications in air transport. We here tackle the problem of generating synthetic, yet realistic, time series of delays at airports, starting from large collections of operations in Europe and the US. We specifically compare three models, two of them based on state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, and one simplified Genetic Algorithm approach. We show how the latter can generate time series that are almost indistinguishable from real ones, while maintaining a high variability. We further validate the resulting time series in a problem of detecting delay propagations between airports. We finally make the synthetic data available to the scientific community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEGATO uses Neural ODE adapters to enable efficient, controllable, and stable identity unlearning in generative models, avoiding catastrophic collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods face inefficiency (requires full fine-tuning), limited controllability (inability to control forgetting intensity and lack of explainability), and catastrophic collapse (drastic degradation of retention capability).

Method: The paper introduces LEGATO, which augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters. This allows for smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. Forgetting intensity is modulated via ODE step size, and trajectory consistency constraints are introduced to prevent catastrophic collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse, and reduces fine-tuned parameters across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the key challenges of machine unlearning in generative models by introducing LEGATO, which models forgetting as a continuous trajectory and uses Neural ODE adapters. This approach achieves efficient, controllable, and stable unlearning without catastrophic collapse.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has become a crucial role in enabling generative models trained on large datasets to remove sensitive, private, or copyright-protected data. However, existing machine unlearning methods face three challenges in learning to forget identity of generative models: 1) inefficient, where identity erasure requires fine-tuning all the model's parameters; 2) limited controllability, where forgetting intensity cannot be controlled and explainability is lacking; 3) catastrophic collapse, where the model's retention capability undergoes drastic degradation as forgetting progresses. Forgetting has typically been handled through discrete and unstable updates, often requiring full-model fine-tuning and leading to catastrophic collapse. In this work, we argue that identity forgetting should be modeled as a continuous trajectory, and introduce LEGATO - Learn to ForgEt Identity in GenerAtive Models via Trajectory-consistent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. LEGATO augments pre-trained generators with fine-tunable lightweight Neural ODE adapters, enabling smooth, controllable forgetting while keeping the original model weights frozen. This formulation allows forgetting intensity to be precisely modulated via ODE step size, offering interpretability and robustness. To further ensure stability, we introduce trajectory consistency constraints that explicitly prevent catastrophic collapse during unlearning. Extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain identity unlearning benchmarks show that LEGATO achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance, avoids catastrophic collapse and reduces fine-tuned parameters.

*Nikolay Yudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study on improving the robustness of character-level Transformers for modular addition tasks against input-format variations like position shifts and out-of-distribution templates, using a training recipe with boundary markers, position curriculum, diverse templates, and consistency training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models achieving high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when input formats vary, such as shifting expression positions or using different templates, highlighting a need for better procedural generalization under noisy supervision.

Method: Baseline model evaluation with a disjoint-pair split for modulus p=97, followed by an intervention: combining explicit expression boundary markers, a position curriculum to expand training positions, diverse template mixtures, and consistency training across example variants.

Result: The intervention significantly improves robustness to position shift and template out-of-distribution while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under the same conditions.

Conclusion: Steering procedural generalization benefits from explicitly training invariances not present in the data distribution, with the proposed recipe offering a reproducible evaluation protocol for enhancing model robustness against input-format variations.

Abstract: Building on insights from the grokking literature, we study character-level Transformers trained to compute modular addition from text, and focus on robustness under input-format variation rather than only in-distribution accuracy. We identify a previously under-emphasized failure mode: models that achieve high in-distribution accuracy can fail catastrophically when the same expression is shifted to different absolute character positions ("position shift") or presented under out-of-distribution natural-language templates. Using a disjoint-pair split over all ordered pairs for p=97, we show that a baseline model reaches strong in-distribution performance yet collapses under position shift and template OOD. We then introduce a simple training recipe that combines (i) explicit expression boundary markers, (ii) position curriculum that broadens the range of absolute positions seen during training, (iii) diverse template mixtures, and (iv) consistency training across multiple variants per example. Across three seeds, this intervention substantially improves robustness to position shift and template OOD while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy, whereas an ALiBi-style ablation fails to learn the task under our setup. Our results suggest that steering procedural generalization under noisy supervision benefits from explicitly training invariances that are otherwise absent from the data distribution, and we provide a reproducible evaluation protocol and artifacts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke rehabilitation can be enhanced with self-initiated robot-assisted therapy, requiring detection of patient movement intention from EEG signals, which is challenging in online asynchronous classification.

Method: Two EEG datasets from 14 healthy subjects performing self-initiated arm movements were analyzed using offline and pseudo-online evaluations with ensemble combinations of SVM, MLP, and EEGNet models and a sliding-window postprocessing technique.

Result: Pseudo-online evaluation showed that classifier ensembles significantly outperformed single models with optimal postprocessing windows. In offline evaluation, no significant improvement was found between best single model and ensembles.

Conclusion: Classifier ensembles and postprocessing effectively enhance asynchronous EEG movement intention detection, with greater improvements in online classification and reduced false detections in stroke rehabilitation contexts.

Abstract: Objective: Stroke is one of the leading causes of disabilities. One promising approach is to extend the rehabilitation with self-initiated robot-assisted movement therapy. To enable this, it is required to detect the patient's intention to move to trigger the assistance of a robotic device. This intention to move can be detected from human surface electroencephalography (EEG) signals; however, it is particularly challenging to decode when classifications are performed online and asynchronously. In this work, the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing technique was investigated to enhance the robustness of such asynchronous classification. Approach: To investigate the effectiveness of classifier ensembles and a sliding-window postprocessing, two EEG datasets with 14 healthy subjects who performed self-initiated arm movements were analyzed. Offline and pseudo-online evaluations were conducted to compare ensemble combinations of the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EEGNet classification models. Results: The results of the pseudo-online evaluation show that the two model ensembles significantly outperformed the best single model for the optimal number of postprocessing windows. In particular, for single models, an increased number of postprocessing windows significantly improved classification performances. Interestingly, we found no significant improvements between performances of the best single model and classifier ensembles in the offline evaluation. Significance: We demonstrated that classifier ensembles and appropriate postprocessing methods effectively enhance the asynchronous detection of movement intentions from EEG signals. In particular, the classifier ensemble approach yields greater improvements in online classification than in offline classification, and reduces false detections, i.e., early false positives.

TL;DR: ArtCognition: A RAG-based multimodal framework that analyzes House-Tree-Person drawings via computer vision and behavioral kinematics for objective psychological assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for objective assessment of human affective and psychological states through non-verbal channels, particularly leveraging the underexplored modality of digital drawing as a rich source for affective sensing.

Method: A multimodal framework called ArtCognition that uses computer vision models to analyze static visual features from final drawings and extracts dynamic behavioral kinematic cues (stroke speed, pauses, smoothness) from the drawing process, integrated through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.

Result: The fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides more nuanced assessment than single modalities, with significant correlations between extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel framework that successfully fuses static visual features and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues from digital drawings for more nuanced affective state assessment, opening new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare.

Abstract: The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians. This work contributes a new methodology for non-intrusive affective state assessment and opens new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare.

TL;DR: An explainable deep learning framework combining continuous glucose monitoring and lab data identified five distinct metabolic phenotypes in Type 1 diabetes patients, revealing meaningful cardiometabolic risk stratification beyond traditional biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Type 1 diabetes is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers like glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), necessitating more comprehensive approaches for metabolic characterization and risk stratification.

Method: The researchers developed an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles using a transformer encoder to model temporal dependencies across modalities. Latent metabolic phenotypes were identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability was achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution.

Result: The framework identified five latent metabolic phenotypes among 577 individuals with T1D, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk. These phenotypes exhibited distinct biochemical profiles including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin levels. Phenotype membership showed statistically significant associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.

Conclusion: The study presents an explainable deep learning framework that successfully identifies physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in Type 1 diabetes, supporting risk stratification beyond single biomarkers and offering potential for improved patient management.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly metabolically heterogeneous disease that cannot be adequately characterized by conventional biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework that integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with laboratory profiles to learn multimodal temporal embeddings of individual metabolic status. Temporal dependencies across modalities are modeled using a transformer encoder, while latent metabolic phenotypes are identified via Gaussian mixture modeling. Model interpretability is achieved through transformer attention visualization and SHAP-based feature attribution. Five latent metabolic phenotypes, ranging from metabolic stability to elevated cardiometabolic risk, were identified among 577 individuals with T1D. These phenotypes exhibit distinct biochemical profiles, including differences in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, renal markers, and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Attention analysis highlights glucose variability as a dominant temporal factor, while SHAP analysis identifies HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, and TSH as key contributors to phenotype differentiation. Phenotype membership shows statistically significant, albeit modest, associations with hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Overall, this explainable multimodal temporal embedding framework reveals physiologically coherent metabolic subgroups in T1D and supports risk stratification beyond single biomarkers.

### [47] [Quantifying the Effect of Test Set Contamination on Generative Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04301)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contamination in pretraining data boosts generative evaluation scores, with effects varying across training stages. Overtraining with fresh data helps, SFT effects depend on contamination level, and longer text is harder to memorize than discriminative outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While test set contamination's impact on discriminative evaluations has been well-studied, its effect on generative evaluations remains under-explored. Understanding this is critical for accurately assessing capabilities of frontier AI systems pretrained on web-scale data.

Method: Authors pretrained language models on mixtures of web data and MATH benchmark, varying model sizes and number of test set replicas. They used scaling laws to analyze contamination effects, studied further training strategies (overtraining with fresh data and supervised finetuning), and analyzed inference factors like temperature sampling and solution length.

Result: Performance improves with both contamination and model size. Even a single test set replica allows models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error on uncontaminated data. Overtraining with fresh data reduces contamination effects, while supervised finetuning's effect depends on pretraining contamination level. Higher sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones.

Conclusion: The study highlights that test set contamination significantly alters generative evaluations through pretraining, further training, and inference stages. Contamination enables models to achieve lower loss than theoretically possible with uncontaminated data. The interaction between generation and memorization introduces new complexities for trustworthy AI evaluation, with longer text sequences being exponentially harder to memorize than discriminative task outputs.

Abstract: As frontier AI systems are pretrained on web-scale data, test set contamination has become a critical concern for accurately assessing their capabilities. While research has thoroughly investigated the impact of test set contamination on discriminative evaluations like multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has studied the impact of test set contamination on generative evaluations. In this work, we quantitatively assess the effect of test set contamination on generative evaluations through the language model lifecycle. We pretrain language models on mixtures of web data and the MATH benchmark, sweeping model sizes and number of test set replicas contaminating the pretraining corpus; performance improves with contamination and model size. Using scaling laws, we make a surprising discovery: including even a single test set replica enables models to achieve lower loss than the irreducible error of training on the uncontaminated corpus. We then study further training: overtraining with fresh data reduces the effects of contamination, whereas supervised finetuning on the training set can either increase or decrease performance on test data, depending on the amount of pretraining contamination. Finally, at inference, we identify factors that modulate memorization: high sampling temperatures mitigate contamination effects, and longer solutions are exponentially more difficult to memorize than shorter ones, presenting a contrast with discriminative evaluations, where solutions are only a few tokens in length. By characterizing how generation and memorization interact, we highlight a new layer of complexity for trustworthy evaluation of AI systems.

*Mohammad Ali Javidian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach for imputing missing target variables across causal systems under domain shift, using mechanism-stable representations with linear and nonlinear solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In causal domain adaptation, the target variable is often missing in the target domain but observed in the source, necessitating accurate imputation under various shifts.

Method: For linear Gaussian models, derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck solution akin to canonical correlation analysis; for nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, use a Variational Information Bottleneck encoder-predictor for high-dimensional scalability.

Result: The method consistently achieves accurate imputations in synthetic and real datasets, enabling zero-shot deployment from source to target domain.

Conclusion: This framework provides a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models.

Abstract: We tackle a common domain adaptation setting in causal systems. In this setting, the target variable is observed in the source domain but is entirely missing in the target domain. We aim to impute the target variable in the target domain from the remaining observed variables under various shifts. We frame this as learning a compact, mechanism-stable representation. This representation preserves information relevant for predicting the target while discarding spurious variation. For linear Gaussian causal models, we derive a closed-form Gaussian Information Bottleneck (GIB) solution. This solution reduces to a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-style projection and offers Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-aware options when desired. For nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, we introduce a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) encoder-predictor. This approach scales to high dimensions and can be trained on source data and deployed zero-shot to the target domain. Across synthetic and real datasets, our approach consistently attains accurate imputations, supporting practical use in high-dimensional causal models and furnishing a unified, lightweight toolkit for causal domain adaptation.

*Rodja Trappe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Phasor Agents use coupled oscillators with wake/sleep-like consolidation to achieve stable, backprop-free learning with planning and latent learning capabilities, validated through systematic experiments showing major performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of stability in oscillatory substrates where online weight updates can collapse representational diversity, by separating wake tagging from offline consolidation.

Method: Uses Phasor Graphs with Stuart-Landau oscillators as computational units, incorporating wake tagging and offline consolidation inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics. Employs three-factor local plasticity with eligibility traces and oscillation-timed write windows.

Result: Significant improvements include: 67% expansion of stable learning under weight-norm budgets, 45.5 percentage point increase in maze success rate with REM replay, and emergence of Tolman-style latent learning with immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed Phasor Agents framework demonstrates robust learning capabilities without backpropagation, achieving stable learning with clear advantages in planning tasks and latent learning.

Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.

*Anton Roupassov-Ruiz,Yiyang Zuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Programmatic policies (PERL) outperform neural policies (NERL) in an evolutionary reinforcement learning testbed, showing longer survival with statistical significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if programmatic policies, implemented as differentiable decision lists, can match or exceed the performance of neural networks in evolutionary reinforcement learning, as neural representations lack modular structure and limit interpretation.

Method: Reimplementation of a 1992 ALife testbed for reproducible evaluation, conducting 4000 trials using survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time metrics.

Result: PERL agents survived 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents on average, and programmatic agents with learning alone outperformed neural agents using both learning and evolution by 73.67 steps.

Conclusion: Programmatic policies can exceed neural policies in survival performance in ALife, offering improved structure and interpretability.

Abstract: In evolutionary reinforcement learning tasks (ERL), agent policies are often encoded as small artificial neural networks (NERL). Such representations lack explicit modular structure, limiting behavioral interpretation. We investigate whether programmatic policies (PERL), implemented as soft, differentiable decision lists (SDDL), can match the performance of NERL. To support reproducible evaluation, we provide the first fully specified and open-source reimplementation of the classic 1992 Artificial Life (ALife) ERL testbed. We conduct a rigorous survival analysis across 4000 independent trials utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) metrics absent in the original study. We find a statistically significant difference in survival probability between PERL and NERL. PERL agents survive on average 201.69 steps longer than NERL agents. Moreover, SDDL agents using learning alone (no evolution) survive on average 73.67 steps longer than neural agents using both learning and evaluation. These results demonstrate that programmatic policies can exceed the survival performance of neural policies in ALife.

*Corentin Lobet,Francesca Chiaromonte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PiNets are pseudo-linear networks designed to provide aligned and faithful explanations for deep neural networks by producing instance-wise linear predictions, enhancing trustworthiness in prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature attribution methods often fail to directly link explanations to model predictions, acting as post-hoc rationalizations rather than truly reflecting the prediction-making process, which undermines trustworthiness.

Method: The paper introduces PiNets, a modeling framework based on pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in any feature space, making them linearly readable to ensure alignment between explanations and predictions.

Result: PiNets are applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating that they generate explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria, including alignment, validating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Model readability through PiNets addresses the issue of explanatory alignment, providing a trustworthy framework for explaining deep neural networks by ensuring explanations are directly linked to predictions.

Abstract: Feature attribution is the dominant paradigm for explaining deep neural networks. However, most existing methods only loosely reflect the model's prediction-making process, thereby merely white-painting the black box. We argue that explanatory alignment is a key aspect of trustworthiness in prediction tasks: explanations must be directly linked to predictions, rather than serving as post-hoc rationalizations. We present model readability as a design principle enabling alignment, and PiNets as a modeling framework to pursue it in a deep learning context. PiNets are pseudo-linear networks that produce instance-wise linear predictions in an arbitrary feature space, making them linearly readable. We illustrate their use on image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating how PiNets produce explanations that are faithful across multiple criteria in addition to alignment.

*Mohsen Jalaeian-Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable fuzzy RL with eligibility traces and segmented replay that rivals deep RL in performance while being more efficient and transparent—ideal for safety‑critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reinforcement learning framework for continuous control that (1) remains interpretable (avoiding non‑transparent neural architectures), (2) is computationally efficient, and (3) delivers stable, high‑performance learning—especially in safety‑critical applications with resource constraints.

Method: Uses a fuzzy rule base instead of neural networks, along with two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation (FBE) with fuzzy eligibility traces (FET) for robust multi‑step credit assignment, and a segmented experience replay (SER) mechanism to improve sample efficiency while keeping memory overhead low.

Result: The method achieves better sample efficiency and lower variance than n‑step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA(λ) baselines, while also maintaining lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives like DDPG. Theoretical convergence is proven under standard assumptions.

Conclusion: Enhanced-FQL(λ) offers a promising approach for embedding interpretability into efficient reinforcement learning, merging theoretical stability with practical viability for constrained and safety-sensitive domains where neural black-box architectures are unsuitable.

Abstract: This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($λ$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for stable multi-step credit assignment, and a memory-efficient segment-based experience replay mechanism for enhanced sample efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed method convergence under standard assumptions. Extensive evaluations in continuous control domains demonstrate that Enhanced-FQL($λ$) achieves superior sample efficiency and reduced variance compared to n-step fuzzy TD and fuzzy SARSA($λ$) baselines, while maintaining substantially lower computational complexity than deep RL alternatives such as DDPG. The framework's inherent interpretability, combined with its computational efficiency and theoretical convergence guarantees, makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications where transparency and resource constraints are essential.

### [54] [Rate or Fate? RLV$^\varepsilon$R: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Noisy Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04411)
*Ali Rad,Khashayar Filom,Darioush Keivan,Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani,Ehsan Kamalinejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR verification noise causes phase transition: learning occurs when verifier accuracy (Youden's index J=TPR-FPR) > 0, else fails. Noise affects convergence rate but not fate when J>0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR approaches face substantial verification noise in practice (imperfect unit tests, human labels, LLM judges) which worsens on harder domains like coding. The paper aims to determine whether this noise merely slows learning or can fundamentally flip the outcome.

Method: The authors develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit model of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO. They model false positives/negatives and group completions into recurring reasoning modes, yielding a replicator-style flow on the probability simplex. Controlled experiments on verifiable programming tasks validate the theoretical predictions.

Result: Results show a sharp phase transition: when J>0, incorrect mass is driven to extinction (learning); when J=0, process is neutral; when J<0, incorrect modes dominate (anti-learning). In the learning regime, noise primarily rescales convergence time rather than changing the final outcome. Experiments confirm the predicted J=0 boundary.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that verification noise in RLVR systems leads to a sharp phase transition determined by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. When J>0 (verifier better than chance), learning occurs albeit slower; when J≤0, learning fails or collapses. This framework provides a principled way to analyze RLVR dynamics and stability beyond just noise.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a simple but powerful paradigm for training LLMs: sample a completion, verify it, and update. In practice, however, the verifier is almost never clean--unit tests probe only limited corner cases; human and synthetic labels are imperfect; and LLM judges (e.g., RLAIF) are noisy and can be exploited--and this problem worsens on harder domains (especially coding) where tests are sparse and increasingly model-generated. We ask a pragmatic question: does the verification noise merely slow down the learning (rate), or can it flip the outcome (fate)?
  To address this, we develop an analytically tractable multi-armed bandit view of RLVR dynamics, instantiated with GRPO and validated in controlled experiments. Modeling false positives and false negatives and grouping completions into recurring reasoning modes yields a replicator-style (natural-selection) flow on the probability simplex. The dynamics decouples into within-correct-mode competition and a one-dimensional evolution for the mass on incorrect modes, whose drift is determined solely by Youden's index J=TPR-FPR. This yields a sharp phase transition: when J>0, the incorrect mass is driven toward extinction (learning); when J=0, the process is neutral; and when J<0, incorrect modes amplify until they dominate (anti-learning and collapse). In the learning regime J>0, noise primarily rescales convergence time ("rate, not fate"). Experiments on verifiable programming tasks under synthetic noise reproduce the predicted J=0 boundary. Beyond noise, the framework offers a general lens for analyzing RLVR stability, convergence, and algorithmic interventions.

*Nausherwan Malik,Zubair Khalid,Muhammad Faryad*

TL;DR: A new distribution-guided quantum machine unlearning framework using tunable target distributions and preservation constraints achieves better forgetting/retention balance than uniform-target methods, as validated on quantum classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses limitations in existing quantum machine unlearning approaches that use fixed, uniform target distributions and lack explicit control over the trade-off between forgetting and maintaining model behavior.

Method: The authors propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning, treating unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. They introduce a tunable target distribution based on model similarity statistics and incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint to maintain predictive behavior on retained data.

Result: The approach demonstrated sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning, as shown in evaluations on variational quantum classifiers using Iris and Covertype datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that distribution-guided unlearning with explicit constraints enables more reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning, as it achieves better alignment with retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target approaches.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data from a learned model without full retraining. While recent work has begun to explore unlearning in quantum machine learning, existing approaches largely rely on fixed, uniform target distributions and do not explicitly control the trade-off between forgetting and retained model behaviour. In this work, we propose a distribution-guided framework for class-level quantum machine unlearning that treats unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Our method introduces a tunable target distribution derived from model similarity statistics, decoupling the suppression of forgotten-class confidence from assumptions about redistribution among retained classes. We further incorporate an anchor-based preservation constraint that explicitly maintains predictive behaviour on selected retained data, yielding a controlled optimization trajectory that limits deviation from the original model. We evaluate the approach on variational quantum classifiers trained on the Iris and Covertype datasets. Results demonstrate sharp suppression of forgotten-class confidence, minimal degradation of retained-class performance, and closer alignment with the gold retrained model baselines compared to uniform-target unlearning. These findings highlight the importance of target design and constraint-based formulations for reliable and interpretable quantum machine unlearning.

TL;DR: SPIN integrates action structure pre-training with lightweight policy heads to enhance reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial spaces, improving returns and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial action spaces is challenging due to exponential search for coherent joint actions; existing methods risk incoherent actions or inefficiency.

Method: Two-stage framework: pre-train Action Structure Model (ASM) to learn valid action manifolds, freeze it, then train lightweight policy heads for control.

Result: SPIN improves average return by up to 39% and reduces convergence time by up to 12.8× on DM Control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN) efficiently addresses combinatorial complexity, enhancing policy coherence and learning speed in discrete action spaces.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial action spaces requires searching over exponentially many joint actions to simultaneously select multiple sub-actions that form coherent combinations. Existing approaches either simplify policy learning by assuming independence across sub-actions, which often yields incoherent or invalid actions, or attempt to learn action structure and control jointly, which is slow and unstable. We introduce Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN), a two-stage framework that first pre-trains an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture the manifold of valid actions, then freezes this representation and trains lightweight policy heads for control. On challenging discrete DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to 39% over the state of the art while reducing time to convergence by up to 12.8$\times$.

TL;DR: This Systematisation of Knowledge paper provides a comprehensive review of performative prediction, develops a risk typology, and introduces a practical assessment framework for evaluating and managing performative effects in ML deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of socio-technical synthesis and practical guidance in performative prediction literature, where machine learning models' predictions actively shape their deployment environments.

Method: Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) approach, involving a comprehensive literature review to synthesize concepts, typology development for risks, and framework creation for assessment.

Result: A comprehensive review of performative prediction literature, an overview of manifestation mechanisms, a typology of associated risks, and a practical assessment framework for practitioners.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting a practical framework, the "Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix," which helps practitioners assess performative effects and determine appropriate intervention levels for deployed predictive models.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains where their predictions can actively shape the environments in which they operate, a phenomenon known as performative prediction. This dynamic, in which the deployment of the model influences the very outcome it seeks to predict, can lead to unintended consequences, including feedback loops, performance issues, and significant societal risks. While the literature in the field has grown rapidly in recent years, a socio-technical synthesis that systemises the phenomenon concepts and provides practical guidance has been lacking. This Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK) addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the literature on performative predictions. We provide an overview of the primary mechanisms through which performativity manifests, present a typology of associated risks, and survey the proposed solutions offered in the literature. Our primary contribution is the ``Performative Strength vs. Impact Matrix" assessment framework. This practical tool is designed to help practitioners assess the potential influence and severity of performativity on their deployed predictive models and select the appropriate level of algorithmic or human intervention.

TL;DR: A logistic regression model with novel graph-based feature selection was developed to predict prolonged hospital stays (>7 days). The model achieved strong performance with 0.82 AUC-ROC and provides transparent insights using nine key variables, making it valuable for hospital management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events.

Method: The approach includes a feature selection method using graph theory to select non-correlated features with the highest information value, followed by training a logistic regression model on data from 120,354 hospital admissions split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts.

Result: The feature selection method identified nine interpretable variables. The model achieved specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83) in the validation cohort.

Conclusion: The model is a valuable tool for hospital management and future intervention studies aimed at reducing prolonged length of stay. It offers insights into factors influencing extended hospital stays.

Abstract: Prolonged length of stay (pLoS) is a significant factor associated with the risk of adverse in-hospital events. We develop and explain a predictive model for pLos using admission-level patient and hospital administrative data. The approach includes a feature selection method by selecting non-correlated features with the highest information value. The method uses features weights of evidence to select a representative within cliques from graph theory. The prognosis study analyzed the records from 120,354 hospital admissions at the Hospital Alma Mater de Antioquia between January 2017 and March 2022. After a cleaning process the dataset was split into training (67%), test (22%), and validation (11%) cohorts. A logistic regression model was trained to predict the pLoS in two classes: less than or greater than 7 days. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC metrics. The feature selection method returns nine interpretable variables, enhancing the models' transparency. In the validation cohort, the pLoS model achieved a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82-0.84), sensitivity of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62-0.65), accuracy of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.76-0.77), precision of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.66-0.69), and AUC-ROC of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.81-0.83). The model exhibits strong predictive performance and offers insights into the factors that influence prolonged hospital stays. This makes it a valuable tool for hospital management and for developing future intervention studies aimed at reducing pLoS.

### [59] [AI Agents as Policymakers in Simulated Epidemics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04245)
*Goshi Aoki,Navid Ghaffarzadegan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Generative AI agent simulates a mayor's epidemic policy decisions, showing human-like behavior; theory-informed prompting improves decision quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are underutilized as computational models for decision-making, particularly in repetitive policy contexts like epidemics.

Method: Develop a generative AI agent in a simulated SEIR environment, using dynamic memory and varying scenarios; test with single- and ensemble-agent settings and with systems-level knowledge.

Result: Agent exhibits reactive behavior tightening/relaxing restrictions based on cases; with epidemic dynamics knowledge, decision quality and stability improve significantly.

Conclusion: Generative AI agents, when prompted with domain theory, can effectively model decision-making for policy design in complex social systems.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as quasi-autonomous systems for specialized tasks, yet their potential as computational models of decision-making remains underexplored. We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.

### [60] [From Idea to Co-Creation: A Planner-Actor-Critic Framework for Agent Augmented 3D Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05016)
*Jin Gao,Saichandu Juluri*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Multi-agent self-reflection framework with human-in-the-loop supervision improves 3D modeling quality by introducing Planner-Actor-Critic architecture that reduces errors and increases complexity compared to single-prompt approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing approaches that rely on single-prompt agents for direct modeling command execution, seeking to improve geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates in 3D modeling.

Method: The proposed framework extends Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. It introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture where the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, with human users acting as supervisors and advisors.

Result: Systematic comparison shows improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Critic-guided reflection with human supervisory input reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality compared to direct single-prompt execution.

Conclusion: The work establishes that structured agent self-reflection with human oversight produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Abstract: We present a framework that extends the Actor-Critic architecture to creative 3D modeling through multi-agent self-reflection and human-in-the-loop supervision. While existing approaches rely on single-prompt agents that directly execute modeling commands via tools like Blender MCP, our approach introduces a Planner-Actor-Critic architecture. In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: A new live evaluation system called FinDeepForecast is introduced to benchmark Deep Research Agents in financial forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive live evaluations of Deep Research Agents on real-world research tasks in high-stakes domains like finance.

Method: An end-to-end multi-agent system with a dual-track taxonomy is developed to dynamically generate forecasting tasks at corporate and macro levels.

Result: Extensive experiments on a benchmark involving 13 methods show DR agents outperform baselines but still lack genuine forward-looking financial reasoning.

Conclusion: The FinDeepForecast system is expected to facilitate future advancements of DR agents in financial forecasting, with the benchmark released publicly.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) Agents powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted the paradigm for completing complex research tasks. Yet, a comprehensive and live evaluation of their forecasting performance on real-world, research-oriented tasks in high-stakes domains (e.g., finance) remains underexplored. We introduce FinDeepForecast, the first live, end-to-end multi-agent system for automatically evaluating DR agents by continuously generating research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. This system is equipped with a dual-track taxonomy, enabling the dynamic generation of recurrent and non-recurrent forecasting tasks at both corporate and macro levels. With this system, we generate FinDeepForecastBench, a weekly evaluation benchmark over a ten-week horizon, encompassing 8 global economies and 1,314 listed companies, and evaluate 13 representative methods. Extensive experiments show that, while DR agents consistently outperform strong baselines, their performance still falls short of genuine forward-looking financial reasoning. We expect the proposed FinDeepForecast system to consistently facilitate future advancements of DR agents in research-oriented financial forecasting tasks. The benchmark and leaderboard are publicly available on the OpenFinArena Platform.
