### [1] [Strongly Solving $7 \times 6$ Connect-Four on Consumer Grade Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05267)
*Markus Böck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a symbolic search method using binary decision diagrams to create a strong solution for Connect-Four, producing an 89.6 GB look-up table in 47 hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Connect-Four being mathematically solved, a look-up table solution was deemed infeasible. The paper revisits symbolic search to achieve this.

Method: Uses binary decision diagrams for symbolic search, implemented efficiently to generate a large look-up table. Includes alpha-beta search for optimal moves.

Result: Produced an 89.6 GB look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB memory, enabling win-draw-loss evaluation and optimal move selection.

Conclusion: The method successfully creates a strong solution for Connect-Four, demonstrating feasibility of look-up tables with efficient symbolic search.

Abstract: While the game Connect-Four has been solved mathematically and the best move
can be effectively computed with search based methods, a strong solution in the
form of a look-up table was believed to be infeasible. In this paper, we
revisit a symbolic search method based on binary decision diagrams to produce
strong solutions. With our efficient implementation we were able to produce a
89.6 GB large look-up table in 47 hours on a single CPU core with 128 GB main
memory for the standard $7 \times 6$ board size. In addition to this
win-draw-loss evaluation, we include an alpha-beta search in our open source
artifact to find the move which achieves the fastest win or slowest loss.

### [2] [Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283)
*Yue Wang,Miao Zhou,Guijing Huang,Rui Zhuo,Chao Yi,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chat2SPaT uses LLMs to convert semi-structured traffic signal control descriptions into exact SPaT results, achieving over 94% accuracy in plan generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual traffic signal plan creation is tedious and repetitive. Chat2SPaT aims to automate this process for efficiency and ease of use.

Method: Leverages LLMs to understand user descriptions, reformat them into JSON, and uses Python scripts to assemble complete signal plans.

Result: Achieves over 94% accuracy in generating plans from descriptions in English and Chinese.

Conclusion: Chat2SPaT offers a user-friendly, accurate solution for traffic signal plan management, showcasing LLMs' potential in ITS.

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans
are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading
to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a
user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study
proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

Motivation: To determine the form of aggregation functions for fuzzy classifications under specific axioms.

Method: Analyze properties like optimality, independence, and zero unanimity for aggregation functions.

Result: The only valid aggregation function is a weighted arithmetic mean.

Conclusion: Weighted arithmetic mean is necessary for such fuzzy classification aggregation.

### [4] [OLG++: A Semantic Extension of Obligation Logic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05488)
*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jon Stephens,Amarnath Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OLG++ extends Obligation Logic Graph (OLG) with richer semantic constructs for legal rule modeling, outperforming prior models like LegalRuleML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance legal knowledge representation by addressing gaps in existing graph-based models, particularly for nuanced regulatory contexts.

Method: Introduces spatial, temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs in OLG++. Demonstrates expressiveness via food business regulations and property graph queries.

Result: OLG++ is more expressive than prior models, supporting complex legal reasoning and question answering.

Conclusion: OLG++ effectively models legal rules with contextual conditions and hierarchies, offering superior expressiveness for regulatory applications.

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

### [5] [Deep Research Comparator: A Platform For Fine-grained Human Annotations of Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05495)
*Prahaladh Chandrahasan,Jiahe Jin,Zhihan Zhang,Tevin Wang,Andy Tang,Lucy Mo,Morteza Ziyadi,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Zimeng Qiu,Markus Dreyer,Akari Asai,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Research Comparator, a platform for evaluating deep research agents by comparing their outputs and collecting detailed feedback. It also presents Simple Deepresearch, a baseline agent scaffold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of evaluating deep research agents, especially for long reports and intermediate steps.

Method: Developed a platform for side-by-side comparison of agent outputs, detailed feedback collection, and ranking. Also created a baseline agent scaffold for easy integration of language models.

Result: Collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on three agents, demonstrating the platform's utility.

Conclusion: The platform provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving deep research agents.

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for AR training, evaluates VLMs on it, and finds limitations in fine-grained tasks, calling for improved datasets and research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of VLMs in AR training and address gaps in fine-grained vision-language alignment.

Method: Developed a comprehensive AR training dataset and evaluated nine state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o.

Result: Advanced VLMs struggle with fine-grained tasks, achieving only 40.54% F1 score on state detection.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better datasets and research, with broader social implications for accessibility.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source
code, and evaluation results, to support the research community.

### [7] [Modeling (Deontic) Modal Operators With the s(CASP) Goal-directed Predicated Answer Set Programming System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05519)
*Gopal Gupta,Abhiramon Rajasekharan,Alexis R. Tudor,Elmer Salazar,Joaquín Arias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to implement deontic modal logic in answer set programming (ASP) using default and strong negation, resolving its paradoxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of implementing deontic modal logic, particularly its paradoxes, by leveraging ASP's features.

Method: Uses default negation and strong negation in ASP to represent deontic modal operators, employing global constraints for obligations and impermissibilities.

Result: The proposed representation elegantly resolves the paradoxes of deontic modal logic.

Conclusion: ASP provides an effective framework for implementing and resolving issues in deontic modal logic.

Abstract: We consider the problem of implementing deontic modal logic. We show how
(deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation
(negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming
(ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and
impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed
representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being
elegantly resolved.

### [8] [Cultivating Multimodal Intelligence: Interpretive Reasoning and Agentic RAG Approaches to Dermatological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05520)
*Karishma Thakrar,Shreyas Basavatia,Akshay Daftardar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper describes a multimodal approach for dermatology question answering, combining fine-tuned models, structured reasoning, and agentic RAG, achieving competitive results in the ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate and interpretable diagnostic decisions in telemedicine with limited input.

Method: Combines fine-tuned multimodal models (Qwen, Gemma, LLaMA), structured reasoning, and agentic RAG for context enhancement.

Result: Achieved second place in the competition, demonstrating high accuracy and competitive performance.

Conclusion: The approach emulates dermatologists' reasoning, offering reliable automated diagnostic support for telemedicine.

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

### [10] [Red Teaming AI Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05538)
*Subhabrata Majumdar,Brian Pendleton,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI red teaming for its narrow focus on model flaws, proposing a two-level framework (macro and micro) to address broader sociotechnical risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the gap between red teaming's original intent and its limited application in AI governance, focusing on systemic and emergent risks.

Method: Proposes a comprehensive framework with macro-level (system-wide) and micro-level (model-specific) red teaming, informed by cybersecurity and systems theory.

Result: Identifies deficiencies in current AI red teaming and suggests a multifunctional approach to examine systemic vulnerabilities and sociotechnical interactions.

Conclusion: Effective AI red teaming requires examining broader systems and emergent behaviors, not just model flaws, to mitigate risks comprehensively.

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

*Shovito Barua Soumma,Asiful Arefeen,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Melanie Hingle,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o-mini for generating counterfactual explanations (CFs) in zero-shot and three-shot settings, outperforming traditional methods in plausibility, validity, and sparsity. It also shows CFs improve downstream classifier performance by 5% in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating human-centric counterfactual explanations (CFs) to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and physiological prediction tasks.

Method: Uses GPT-4o-mini in zero-shot and three-shot settings to generate CFs, evaluated on stress prediction (AI-Readi dataset) and heart disease detection (public dataset). Compares with DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE.

Result: Achieves high plausibility (99%), strong validity (0.99), and competitive sparsity. Augmented CFs improve classifier accuracy by 5% in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: Prompt-based generative techniques with LLMs can effectively enhance explainability and robustness in clinical prediction tasks.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

### [12] [SingLoRA: Low Rank Adaptation Using a Single Matrix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05566)
*David Bensaïd,Noam Rotstein,Roy Velich,Daniel Bensaïd,Ron Kimmel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SingLoRA improves LoRA by reformulating low-rank adaptation as a single matrix decomposition, ensuring stable training and reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scale disparities in LoRA causing unstable training and suboptimal performance.

Method: SingLoRA decomposes weight updates into a single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose, eliminating scale conflicts.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy (91.3% vs 89.1% for LoRA) and better image fidelity (DINO score 0.151 vs 0.148 for DoRA) with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SingLoRA offers a stable, parameter-efficient alternative to LoRA, outperforming it in both NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal theory of AI measurement is proposed to enable comparisons, connect evaluations with risk analysis, and highlight the contingency of AI capabilities on measurement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize AI measurement for better comparisons, risk analysis integration, and understanding of AI capability dependencies.

Method: Introduces a layered measurement stack, distinguishes direct/indirect observables, and outlines a unified taxonomy for AI phenomena.

Result: Provides a pathway for a standardized, calibratable taxonomy of AI measurements.

Conclusion: Formalizing AI measurement can enhance research, practice, and regulation by clarifying evaluations and capabilities.

Abstract: We motivate and outline a programme for a formal theory of measurement of
artificial intelligence. We argue that formalising measurement for AI will
allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

### [14] [MLlm-DR: Towards Explainable Depression Recognition with MultiModal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05591)
*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,En Zhu,Wenhong Cheng,YunPeng Li,Yanbo J. Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes MLlm-DR, a multimodal LLM for explainable depression diagnosis, integrating a smaller LLM and LQ-former, achieving top results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of explainability in automated depression diagnosis and poor performance of current LLMs on interview data.

Method: Combines a smaller LLM for score/rationale generation and LQ-former for multimodal feature extraction, trained on a robust dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ datasets.

Conclusion: MLlm-DR is effective and superior for explainable depression diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Result: Geotechnical-adapted LLMs show promise in tasks like geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, and risk assessment, though limitations exist.

Conclusion: The survey provides a foundation for integrating LLMs into geotechnical practice and encourages further interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

*Wei Zhang,Juan Chen,Yanbo J. Wang,En Zhu,Xuan Yang,Yiduo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ADMC uses an Attention-based Diffusion model to complete missing modalities in emotion/intent recognition, avoiding over-coupling and improving performance in all scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of missing modalities in multimodal emotion/intent recognition, where traditional methods suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation.

Method: ADMC independently trains feature extraction for each modality, then uses an Attention-based Diffusion Network (ADN) to generate missing features aligned with authentic multimodal distribution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, enhancing performance in both missing and full-modality scenarios.

Conclusion: ADMC effectively handles missing modalities and improves recognition accuracy, demonstrating robustness in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

*Yuan An,John Liu,Niyam Acharya,Ruhma Hashmi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-generated retrieval practice questions improve student learning outcomes, with 89% accuracy vs. 73% without, but require manual verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-generated retrieval practice questions in enhancing student learning and retention.

Method: Empirical study in two college-level data science courses (60 students), comparing weeks with and without LLM-generated retrieval practice.

Result: Students with LLM-generated questions achieved 89% accuracy vs. 73% without, showing significant improvement.

Conclusion: LLM-generated retrieval practice is effective but requires manual verification for quality assurance.

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without
such practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions
can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

*Litian Zhang,Xiaoming Zhang,Bingyu Yan,Ziyi Zhou,Bo Zhang,Zhenyu Guan,Xi Zhang,Chaozhuo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses misinformation spread on social media using LLMs, identifies gaps in simulating human behavior, and proposes SIP-CoT with emotion-guided memory to enhance realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of social media and generative AI has increased misinformation, requiring better models to understand and control information spread, as traditional methods fall short.

Method: The authors introduce an LLM-based simulation with SIP-CoT and emotion-guided memory to improve psychological realism in agent behaviors.

Result: SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents show behaviors closer to real human interactions, addressing gaps in stance detection and emotional processing.

Conclusion: Integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly improves the social intelligence and realism of LLM agents in misinformation simulations.

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

### [19] [City-Level Foreign Direct Investment Prediction with Tabular Learning on Judicial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05651)
*Tianxing Wu,Lizhe Cao,Shuang Wang,Jiming Wang,Shutong Zhu,Yerong Wu,Yuqing Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method (TLJD) for predicting city-level FDI using judicial data instead of economic data to avoid manipulation issues. It achieves high accuracy (R2 ≥ 0.92) and outperforms other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic data like GDP can be manipulated, making FDI predictions unreliable. Judicial data offers a more secure and transparent alternative for assessing investment conditions.

Method: The authors build an index system from 12M adjudication documents, reformulate a tabular dataset, and propose TLJD, which integrates row/column data and uses a mixture of experts model for regional adjustments.

Result: TLJD outperforms ten baselines in cross-city and cross-time tasks, achieving R2 scores of at least 0.92.

Conclusion: Judicial data is a reliable alternative for FDI prediction, and TLJD is an effective method for this task.

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

*Dipayan Sengupta,Saumya Panda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares AI and human-generated dermatology treatment plans, revealing a significant evaluator effect where humans favor peer plans while an AI judge prefers AI-generated ones, highlighting a reasoning gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the quality of AI-generated treatment plans compared to human experts and explore the impact of evaluator bias in clinical settings.

Method: Ten dermatologists, GPT-4o (generalist AI), and o3 (reasoning AI) created anonymized treatment plans for five cases, evaluated by human peers and a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro).

Result: Humans scored peer plans higher (mean 7.62) than AI plans (7.16), while the AI judge favored AI plans (mean 7.75) over human plans (6.79), ranking o3 highest.

Conclusion: Evaluator nature affects plan quality perception, revealing a gap between clinical heuristics and algorithmic logic, necessitating synergistic human-AI systems for future integration.

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

### [21] [An autonomous agent for auditing and improving the reliability of clinical AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05755)
*Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ModelAuditor is a tool to audit AI models for real-world clinical deployment, identifying failure modes and improving performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often fail in real-world clinical settings due to minor variations, and current auditing methods are inefficient.

Method: ModelAuditor uses a self-reflective agent to simulate shifts, generate reports, and recommend mitigations.

Result: It identifies failure modes and recovers 15-25% lost performance, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: ModelAuditor is a cost-effective, efficient solution for improving AI reliability in clinical practice.

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method for real-time battery SoH monitoring in microgrids uses discharge pulse analysis during the charge phase, showing promising accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional battery SoH monitoring methods are limited in microgrids due to operational constraints, necessitating an innovative approach.

Method: Analyzes a discharge pulse at the end of the charge phase, using parameters of an equivalent electrical model to estimate SoH.

Result: Achieved ~1% mean absolute error in predicting battery degradation and an explainability score of ~0.9.

Conclusion: The method is viable for integration into BMS and supports optimized battery management in continuous operation.

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTA1, a GUI agent addressing task planning ambiguity and visual grounding challenges using test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle ambiguity in task planning and improve visual grounding accuracy in GUI agents operating across platforms.

Method: Uses a test-time scaling method for action proposal selection and a reinforcement learning model for precise visual element interaction.

Result: Achieves high accuracies (e.g., 50.1% on Screenspot-Pro) and state-of-the-art task success rates (e.g., 45.2% on OSWorld).

Conclusion: GTA1 effectively resolves planning ambiguity and enhances visual grounding, setting new benchmarks in GUI agent performance.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

*Shuai Zhao,Yulin Zhang,Luwei Xiao,Xinyi Wu,Yanhao Jia,Zhongliang Guo,Xiaobao Wu,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Guoming Zhang,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROP, a Chinese dataset for ROP risk prediction, and Affective-ROPTester, a framework to evaluate LLMs' predictive capabilities and affective biases in ROP risk stratification. Results show LLMs improve with external inputs and exhibit affective biases, with positive framing reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' unexplored potential in predicting ROP risk and investigate affective biases in their predictions.

Method: Proposes Affective-ROPTester, using three prompting strategies (Instruction-based, CoT, ICL) and integrating emotional elements to evaluate LLMs on the CROP dataset.

Result: LLMs perform poorly with intrinsic knowledge but improve with external inputs. Affective biases are observed, with positive framing reducing bias.

Conclusion: Affect-sensitive prompt engineering is crucial for reliable diagnostics, and Affective-ROPTester is effective for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

TL;DR: The paper critiques AI's lack of human-like decision-making in games, reviews cognitive psychology insights, and introduces CogniPlay, a model aiming to replicate human cognition in General Game Playing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI excels in games but lacks human-like intuitive decision-making, prompting the need for models that mimic human cognition.

Method: The paper reviews cognitive psychology and prior models, then proposes CogniPlay, a work-in-progress model for GGP.

Result: CogniPlay is introduced as a potential solution to bridge the gap between AI performance and human-like cognition in games.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the gap in AI's human-like cognition and proposes CogniPlay as a step toward addressing it.

Abstract: While AI systems have equaled or surpassed human performance in a wide
variety of games such as Chess, Go, or Dota 2, describing these systems as
truly "human-like" remains far-fetched. Despite their success, they fail to
replicate the pattern-based, intuitive decision-making processes observed in
human cognition. This paper presents an overview of findings from cognitive
psychology and previous efforts to model human-like behavior in artificial
agents, discusses their applicability to General Game Playing (GGP) and
introduces our work-in-progress model based on these observations: CogniPlay.

TL;DR: Proposes Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled model for combining symbolic algorithms and LLMs in AR tools, ensuring strong guarantees and deeper synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ad hoc neurosymbolic AR systems lack strong guarantees and fail to fully leverage LLM-powered reasoning.

Method: Introduces Neurosymbolic Transition Systems, pairing symbolic state with intuition and parallel transitions.

Result: Enables scalable logical reasoning with symbolic guarantees and deeper neural-symbolic integration.

Conclusion: The proposed model can enhance AR tools by unifying symbolic and neural reasoning effectively.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decomposed approach to time series forecasting using Transformers, focusing on sequence representation, memory construction, and target projection, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting is challenging due to diverse datasets and configurations, requiring task-specific solutions for sequence representation, information extraction, and projection.

Method: The pipeline is decomposed into three stages: input sequence representation, information extraction/memory construction, and target projection, using modules like convolutional layers and self-attention.

Result: The models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with improved computational efficiency, including faster training/inference and fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The decomposed approach effectively addresses task-specific challenges in time series forecasting, offering high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter
count. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI models to imagine scenes from music, similar to humans, by integrating cross-modal information from video and audio.

Method: Construct a video-audio caption dataset, finetune Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA) for MSI to create MusiScene, and evaluate its performance.

Result: MusiScene generates more contextually relevant captions than MU-LLaMA and improves VBMG.

Conclusion: MusiScene advances music captioning by incorporating scene imagination, demonstrating its effectiveness in cross-modal tasks and applications like VBMG.

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of
generating contextually relevant captions compared to MU-LLaMA. We leverage the
generated MSI captions to enhance Video Background Music Generation (VBMG) from

Motivation: To advance high-performance, on-device MLLMs with efficient training and multimodal capabilities.

Method: Developed via diversified data curation, resampling, hybrid reinforcement learning, and high-performance training infrastructure.

Result: Achieves comparable text performance to Qwen3-4B and trails Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by 5% in multimodal tasks. Outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B in non-thinking mode.

Conclusion: BlueLM-2.5-3B demonstrates efficient, high-performance MLLM capabilities, contributing insights for on-device deployment.

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

TL;DR: A unified foundation model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks is proposed, outperforming traditional DL methods with strong generalization and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of mobile networks necessitates accurate predictions for PHY/MAC-layer tasks, but traditional DL methods struggle with generalization across scenarios.

Method: The model uses univariate decomposition, granularity encoding, a causal Transformer backbone, and patch masking for arbitrary input lengths.

Result: The model generalizes well to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot performance surpassing traditional baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model effectively addresses multi-task prediction challenges in wireless networks with superior adaptability and performance.

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Motivation: Address the lack of transparency in AI-driven healthcare decisions to improve interpretability and acceptance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves AI interpretability in healthcare, aiding risk assessment for lymphedema.

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HopeBot, an LLM-powered chatbot, effectively administers PHQ-9 for depression screening, showing strong agreement with self-administered tests and high user trust and satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static tools like PHQ-9 lack interactivity and adaptability, prompting the development of HopeBot to enhance user experience and scalability in depression screening.

Method: HopeBot uses retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification to administer PHQ-9. A within-subject study with 132 participants compared self-administered and chatbot versions.

Result: Scores showed strong agreement (ICC = 0.91), 71% trusted the chatbot more, and 87.1% were willing to reuse or recommend it. User ratings for comfort, clarity, and handling sensitive topics were high.

Conclusion: Voice-based LLM chatbots like HopeBot are feasible, scalable, and low-burden adjuncts for routine depression screening.

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

*Kushal Gajjar,Harshit Sikchi,Arpit Singh Gautam,Marc Hammons,Saurabh Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning framework, achieves state-of-the-art SQL generation accuracy with a lightweight reward signal, outperforming larger models despite its smaller 7B backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving Text-to-SQL translation by addressing challenges in generating correct and executable SQL for complex queries, leveraging reinforcement learning for better alignment with execution correctness.

Method: Uses a reinforcement learning framework with a lightweight reward signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance, avoiding intermediate supervision and complex reward shaping.

Result: Achieves top execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmarks (BIRD), outperforming larger models like SFT CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B, while trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of RL-based approaches for Text-to-SQL, supported by the release of curated datasets to advance further research.

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

*Courtney Ford,Mark T. Keane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FGNS improves interpretability in XAI by selecting class-representative examples, aiding non-experts in identifying model errors more effectively than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods often fail to provide clear outputs for non-experts, limiting their usability.

Method: FGNS uses local and global feature importance to select neighbors, enhancing interpretability.

Result: FGNS improved non-experts' accuracy and speed in identifying errors, with better class-representative neighbor selection.

Conclusion: FGNS advances human-aligned model assessment but requires further work to bridge explanation quality and trust.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

*Tommaso Flaminio,Lluis Godo,Ramón Pino Pérez,Lluis Subirana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Lockean belief sets, focusing on their closure under classical logic and proposing a minimal revision method for probabilistic updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Lockean thesis's limitations, such as lack of closure under classical logic, hinder its use in belief change theory, prompting this study.

Method: The paper provides two characterizations of belief sets closed under classical logic and introduces a minimal revision approach for probabilistic updates.

Result: The study demonstrates how to deductively close a belief set with minimal changes, accommodating new information efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses the limitations of Lockean belief sets, enabling their practical use in belief change theory.

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

*Bo Pang,Yalu Ouyang,Hangfei Xu,Ziqi Jia,Panpan Li,Shengzhao Wen,Lu Wang,Shiyong Li,Yanpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEVO enhances LLM performance in finance using continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research applies LLM reasoning advancements to finance, which requires domain-specific knowledge.

Method: FEVO uses CPT, SFT, and RL to expand financial knowledge and reasoning, with curated datasets (FEVO-Train).

Result: FEVO-R32B outperforms larger and specialist models on five financial benchmarks.

Conclusion: FEVO validates the effectiveness of financial knowledge expansion and structured reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

*Iman Rahimi,Isha Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based framework (LSTM-GA-SHAP) for healthcare energy management, outperforming traditional methods like ARIMA and Prophet in forecasting accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies and high costs in healthcare energy management due to fluctuating demands and inadequate traditional methods.

Method: Combines LSTM for time-series forecasting, GA for parameter optimization, and SHAP for model transparency.

Result: LSTM achieves lower MAE (21.69) and RMSE (29.96) compared to Prophet and ARIMA, with GA improving load balancing and SHAP enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: The LSTM-GA-SHAP framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for healthcare energy management, with potential for future real-time and hybrid reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

*Sanidhya Vijayvargiya,Aditya Bharat Soni,Xuhui Zhou,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Nouha Dziri,Graham Neubig,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenAgentSafety is a modular framework for evaluating AI agent safety across real-world tools and tasks, revealing significant unsafe behaviors in prominent LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI agent safety are limited by simulated environments or narrow tasks, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The framework evaluates agents using real tools (e.g., web browsers, code execution) and supports 350+ multi-turn tasks, combining rule-based and LLM-as-judge assessments.

Result: Unsafe behavior was detected in 51.2% to 72.7% of tasks across five LLMs, highlighting safety vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: OpenAgentSafety underscores the need for stronger safeguards before deploying AI agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

### [39] [The Delta Learning Hypothesis: Preference Tuning on Weak Data can Yield Strong Gains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06187)
*Scott Geng,Hamish Ivison,Chun-Liang Li,Maarten Sap,Jerry Li,Ranjay Krishna,Pang Wei Koh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Delta learning hypothesis shows that paired preference data with weak individual points can improve model performance beyond the strength of each point, validated in experiments and at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of strong supervision scarcity by leveraging weak paired preference data for model improvement.

Method: Formulated delta learning hypothesis, validated via controlled experiments and post-training 8B models on preference data from smaller models (3B and 1.5B).

Result: Matched performance of state-of-the-art Tulu 3 on an 11-benchmark suite, using simpler and cheaper methods.

Conclusion: Delta learning enables effective model improvement from weak paired data, offering a cost-efficient alternative to strong supervision.

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

*Clément Yvernes,Emilie Devijver,Marianne Clausel,Eric Gaussier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores causal abstractions—simplified causal diagrams—to address identifiability of causal queries when full causal knowledge is unavailable, organizing criteria into a hierarchy for clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational data analysis often assumes fully specified causal diagrams, which are rarely known, especially in complex settings. Causal abstractions offer a practical alternative.

Method: The authors formalize causal abstractions as collections of causal diagrams and introduce identifiability criteria, organizing them into a structured hierarchy.

Result: A hierarchical framework is developed to clarify identifiability under varying levels of causal knowledge, supported by examples and reasoning tools.

Conclusion: The framework enhances understanding of causal identifiability without full causal diagrams, providing practical tools for analysis.

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

### [41] [Aligned Textual Scoring Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06221)
*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Michael J. Curry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR) for text, optimizing alignment with human preferences while maintaining properness in scoring rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proper scoring rules for textual information elicitation may not align well with human preferences, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Designs the ASR by minimizing the mean squared error between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g., human score).

Result: ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with human preference while preserving properness.

Conclusion: The ASR effectively balances properness and human preference alignment in textual scoring rules.

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

### [42] [Rethinking Over-Smoothing in Graph Neural Networks: A Perspective from Anderson Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05263)
*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores over-smoothing in GNNs, linking it to Anderson localization, and proposes reducing disorder to mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the over-smoothing issue in deep GNNs, which causes loss of node distinctiveness.

Method: Analyzes over-smoothing via Anderson localization analogy, introduces participation degree as a metric, and suggests reducing disorder in information propagation.

Result: Over-smoothing in GNNs resembles low-frequency mode expansion and high-frequency mode localization, similar to disordered systems.

Conclusion: Reducing disorder in information propagation could alleviate over-smoothing in GNNs, as supported by theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

*Mustafa Kamal,Niyaz Bin Hashem,Robin Krambroeckers,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method improves time series forecasting by whitening exogenous inputs to reduce redundancy and enhance long-term dependency awareness, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy and limited long-term dependency capture in transformer-based models using exogenous inputs.

Method: Whitens exogenous inputs based on global statistics and integrates them with endogenous inputs without extending look-back windows.

Result: Outperforms 11 baseline models on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method is a robust and effective alternative for leveraging exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel DNN compression method using XAI (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) reduces model size by 64% with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are computationally expensive; compression techniques like pruning and quantization are needed for edge devices. XAI helps understand DNN inner workings.

Method: Uses gradient-based XAI (LRP) to compute importance scores of weights. Prunes negative/zero-score weights and applies mixed-precision quantization.

Result: 64% model size reduction and 42% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art XAI-based compression.

Conclusion: The approach effectively compresses DNNs with minimal accuracy loss, leveraging XAI for efficient parameter reduction.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P-DivGNN is a physics-informed machine learning framework for reconstructing micro-scale stress fields using graph neural networks, incorporating physical constraints and periodic boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate local stress field prediction is crucial for fracture analysis and fatigue criteria, but traditional methods like FE simulations are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses a message-passing graph neural network on a periodic micro-structure graph, incorporating physical constraints for equilibrium and periodic boundary conditions.

Result: Achieves accurate stress field reconstruction and significant computational speed-ups, especially for non-linear hyperelastic cases.

Conclusion: P-DivGNN is efficient for large-scale applications, outperforming FE simulations in speed while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeVe introduces 'neural velocity' to dynamically adjust learning rates and stop criteria, reducing reliance on validation loss and held-out datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperparameter tuning relies heavily on validation loss, which requires a held-out dataset. NeVe aims to provide a more efficient alternative.

Method: NeVe measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function (neural velocity) to guide learning rate adjustments and stop criteria, even using noise inputs.

Result: Neural velocity proves effective as a metric for optimizing training, eliminating the need for a held-out dataset.

Conclusion: Neural velocity is a promising metric for dynamic training optimization, offering efficiency and reduced data dependency.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

*Madina Kojanazarova,Florentin Bieder,Robin Sandkühler,Philippe C. Cattin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data-driven model using a conditional graph neural network (cGNN) predicts soft tissue deformations and forces accurately, trained with simulated and experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is crucial for medical applications but faces challenges due to high deformability and the need for precise haptic feedback.

Method: The cGNN model uses surface points and force locations to predict deformations and forces, trained via transfer learning with mass-spring simulations and experimental data.

Result: The model achieves 0.35±0.03 mm error for deformations (up to 30 mm) and 0.37±0.05 N error for forces (up to 7.5 N).

Conclusion: The data-driven approach offers a promising solution for soft tissue simulation, with potential applications beyond medical fields.

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

*Marc Bara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First dataless neural network approach for RCPSP, transforming scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives for gradient-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in extending dataless neural networks to RCPSP, traditionally solved with sequential algorithms.

Method: Uses smooth relaxations, automatic differentiation, and a dense time-grid representation to encode constraints.

Result: Implementation and experiments on PSPLIB benchmarks (J30, J60, J120) are ongoing; results to be reported later.

Conclusion: Pioneers a dataless neural approach for RCPSP, enabling GPU parallelization and gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

### [49] [Going Beyond Heuristics by Imposing Policy Improvement as a Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05328)
*Chi-Chang Lee,Zhang-Wei Hong,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEPO is a new RL framework that leverages heuristic rewards effectively by focusing on policy improvement rather than policy invariance, reducing human effort in reward design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for incorporating heuristic rewards in RL often fail due to reliance on policy invariance, which doesn't improve performance. HEPO aims to address this by maximizing policy improvement.

Method: HEPO (Heuristic Enhanced Policy Optimization) avoids reward hacking by prioritizing policy improvement over policy invariance, allowing effective use of heuristic rewards.

Result: HEPO outperforms standard benchmarks with well-engineered rewards and works even with poorly designed heuristics, reducing human effort.

Conclusion: HEPO provides a practical solution for leveraging heuristic rewards in RL, improving performance and reducing dependency on expert-designed rewards.

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

*Jeroen Audenaert,Daniel Muthukrishna,Paul F. Gregory,David W. Hogg,V. Ashley Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A foundation model for time series data disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder and contrastive learning, improving generalization in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observations often mix true physical phenomena with instrumental distortions, limiting model generalization in multi-instrument scenarios.

Method: The model uses a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning on observational triplets to separate latent representations of physical signals and instrument effects.

Result: Outperforms traditional models on simulated astronomical time series, especially in low-data regimes, demonstrating few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation.

Conclusion: Encoding causal structure into representation learning is crucial for foundation models handling structured data.

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) in continual post-training (CPT) for multimodal models, finding RFT better preserves knowledge and general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of learning paradigms (SFT vs. RFT) on knowledge retention in CPT, as prior work overlooked this aspect.

Method: Comparative analysis of SFT and RFT on seven multimodal tasks using Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with experiments and an instance filtering algorithm for RFT.

Result: RFT outperforms SFT in retaining prior knowledge and general capabilities, with implicit regularization being key. SFT causes catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: RFT is superior for CPT due to its robustness in knowledge retention and general capability preservation.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance formal verification of neural networks by tightening reachable sets with probabilistic guarantees.

Method: Combines LiRPA-based over-approximation with sampling to estimate tight intermediate reachable sets.

Result: Improves robustness certificates by up to 3.31X and 2.26X, with 99% confidence in challenging cases.

Conclusion: PT-LiRPA offers a computationally efficient and probabilistically sound solution for neural network verification.

Abstract: We present $\textbf{P}$robabilistically $\textbf{T}$ightened
$\textbf{Li}$near $\textbf{R}$elaxation-based $\textbf{P}$erturbation
$\textbf{A}$nalysis ($\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$), a novel framework that combines
over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based
method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that
with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the
estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide
answers with high confidence (i.e., at least 99%).

TL;DR: AXLearn is a modular, high-performance deep learning system designed for scalable training of large models, with unique support for heterogeneous hardware and low complexity scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of modularity and scalability in existing deep learning systems, enabling rapid model development and experimentation on diverse hardware.

Method: AXLearn uses strict encapsulation of interfaces between components and introduces a novel LoC-complexity metric to quantify modularity, ensuring constant complexity as components scale.

Result: AXLearn integrates features like RoPE with minimal code (10 lines vs. hundreds in other systems) while matching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: AXLearn successfully combines modularity, scalability, and performance, offering a practical solution for large-scale deep learning training.

Abstract: We design and implement AXLearn, a production deep learning system that
facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning
models. Compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a
unique focus on modularity and support for heterogeneous hardware
infrastructure. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components
follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to
facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure. We introduce a novel method of quantifying modularity via
Lines-of-Code (LoC)-complexity, which demonstrates how our system maintains
constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to
linear or quadratic complexity in other systems. This allows integrating
features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred
of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in
other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance
compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience
in the development and operation of AXLearn.

*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepLIn, a method to learn robust representations of causally-related latent variables by leveraging interventional data and enforcing independence conditions derived from the causal model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat interventional data like observational data, ignoring causal independence relations, leading to performance disparities. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose RepLIn, a training algorithm that enforces statistical independence during interventions, derived from theoretical conditions for linear models.

Result: RepLIn improves robustness against interventional distribution shifts, demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets (facial attribute classification and toxicity detection).

Conclusion: RepLIn is scalable and effective for learning robust representations of both continuous and discrete latent variables under interventional shifts.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural emissions significantly impact air quality and public health, but current physics-based models fail to capture complex pollutant interactions.

Method: Two novel deep learning architectures (EmissionNet and EmissionNet-Transformer) are introduced, combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches to model spatial-temporal dependencies in emissions data.

Result: The proposed models aim to improve forecasting accuracy for N2O emissions by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques.

Conclusion: Deep learning offers a promising alternative to traditional methods for predicting agricultural emissions, potentially enhancing air quality management.

Abstract: Air pollution from agricultural emissions is a significant yet often
overlooked contributor to environmental and public health challenges.
Traditional air quality forecasting models rely on physics-based approaches,
which struggle to capture complex, nonlinear pollutant interactions. In this
work, we explore forecasting N$_2$O agricultural emissions through evaluating
popular architectures, and proposing two novel deep learning architectures,
EmissionNet (ENV) and EmissionNet-Transformer (ENT). These models leverage

TL;DR: MVMO attacks enable distressed firms to manipulate financial reports more effectively, inflating earnings by 100-200% while reducing fraud scores by 15% in 50% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distressed firms seek to hide financial distress and gain personal benefits by manipulating reports, leveraging financial modeling frameworks.

Method: Introduces Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks, adapting search direction to find more effective manipulations.

Result: MVMO attacks achieve 20x more satisfying results, with 50% success in inflating earnings by 100-200% and reducing fraud scores by 15%.

Conclusion: MVMO attacks present a realistic threat model for financial fraud, validated by professionals.

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

TL;DR: A unified distributional multi-step RL framework is introduced to tackle delayed/sparse rewards in games like 2048, outperforming standard methods with H-DQN achieving the highest scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of delayed/sparse rewards in RL, especially in games like 2048 where immediate feedback can mislead agents.

Method: Developed and compared four RL agents (DQN, PPO, QR-DQN, H-DQN) using Gym-2048, with H-DQN integrating advanced techniques like distributional learning and prioritized replay.

Result: H-DQN outperformed others, achieving max scores of 18.21K (2048 tile) and 41.828K (4096 tile) upon scaling.

Conclusion: Distributional multi-step RL significantly improves performance in sparse-reward domains, with potential for further gains via model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using forward-backward (FB) representations for exploration in zero-shot reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency by minimizing epistemic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot reinforcement learning lacks concrete rewards, requiring efficient exploration for optimal policy adaptation. Current methods decouple FB representations from exploration, limiting efficiency.

Method: The authors design exploration policies from FB representations to minimize posterior variance and epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Empirical results show improved sample complexity compared to other exploration methods.

Conclusion: FB-based exploration enhances zero-shot reinforcement learning efficiency, with publicly available code for implementation.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

TL;DR: The paper reframes dynamic regret minimization in online convex optimization as a static regret problem in a function space using RKHS, achieving optimal guarantees and practical computability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dynamic regret guarantees by leveraging function space representations, enabling broader applicability beyond linear losses.

Method: Reduces dynamic regret to static regret in a RKHS, allowing for optimal and adaptive regret bounds across various loss types.

Result: Achieves optimal dynamic regret for linear losses and new bounds for exp-concave and improper linear regression settings.

Conclusion: The RKHS-based approach provides a versatile and computable solution for dynamic regret minimization in online convex optimization.

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

*Van Khoa Nguyen,Lionel Blondé,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a training-free framework for diffusion models, unifying stochastic optimal control (SOC) and classifier-based guidance. It corrects approximate posteriors using Stein variational inference, outperforming existing methods in molecular generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOC methods for diffusion models are computationally intensive, while training-free classifier-based approaches introduce errors in guidance. The paper aims to combine their strengths and address the limitations.

Method: The authors derive a theoretical bound on the value function, connect the problem to Stein variational inference, and propose SDG with a correction mechanism and novel running cost functional.

Result: SDG significantly outperforms standard training-free guidance methods in molecular generation tasks.

Conclusion: SDG offers a principled, effective guidance framework for diffusion models, with potential for broader applications beyond molecular generation.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Result: Ex-HiDeNN achieves significantly smaller errors than reference methods and traditional symbolic regression in benchmarks and engineering applications.

Conclusion: Ex-HiDeNN demonstrates superior performance in discovering closed-form expressions, with potential for future extensions despite current limitations.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network

the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve occupancy and movement prediction in campus buildings by leveraging Wi-Fi data without compromising privacy or making assumptions about occupant behavior.

Method: A novel Graph Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) is used to model traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs and building schedules, treating buildings as nodes in a graph.

Result: The GCLSTM model significantly outperforms traditional methods like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Linear Regression in predicting pedestrian flows.

Conclusion: The integrated GCLSTM approach is effective for dynamic occupancy and movement prediction, offering a data-driven solution with strong performance.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour

proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication overhead is a bottleneck in distributed learning, and existing gradient compression techniques trade off empirical efficiency (biased) for theoretical guarantees (unbiased).

Method: Introduces a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that uses biased compressors to create unbiased estimates, applied to Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors. Also develops an adaptive version.

Result: Enhanced variants of popular compressors are created, and the method is validated empirically on distributed deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: The MLMC scheme effectively combines the strengths of biased and unbiased compressors, offering improved performance in distributed learning.

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods like R-learner and Causal Forest by over 20%, proving cost-efficiency and real-world impact.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, effective in various scenarios, and validated through successful global deployments.

Abstract: User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize
costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel
treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By
leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to
optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while
minimizing costs. Unlike traditional prediction methods, our model directly
models uplifts in key business metrics. Further, our deep learning model can
jointly optimize parameters for an aggregated loss function using softmax
gating. Our approach surpasses traditional methods by directly targeting
desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including

*Jennifer Y. Zhang,Shuyang Du,Will Y. Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) with structured treatment policies, combining continuous and discrete variables, and proposes a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes method for ranking subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of expanding treatment action spaces beyond binary variables to structured policies with multiple factors, enabling more nuanced HTE estimation.

Method: Derives formulations for multiple treatment policy variables, develops a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within deep learning, and applies it to continuous/discrete treatments and ranking.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on public datasets, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances HTE estimation for complex treatment policies, offering practical benefits in diverse applications.

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

*Anish Dhir,Cristiana Diaconu,Valentinian Mihai Lungu,James Requeima,Richard E. Turner,Mark van der Wilk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MACE-TNP, a meta-learning model for Bayesian causal inference, addressing computational challenges in causal structure discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage structural uncertainty in causal inference without committing to a single causal graph, avoiding overconfidence and computational intractability.

Method: Proposes MACE-TNP, an end-to-end meta-learning model trained to predict Bayesian model-averaged interventional distributions, bypassing expensive computations.

Result: MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines empirically.

Conclusion: Meta-learning is a scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal inference, with potential for future scalability.

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

### [67] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning with InterpoLated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05527)
*Michalis Korakakis,Andreas Vlachos,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterpoLL mitigates shortcut reliance in models by interpolating representations of majority and minority examples, improving generalization without sacrificing majority accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERM models exploit shortcuts (spurious correlations), hindering generalization on minority examples. Existing methods are limited and fail to enhance representations.

Method: InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) interpolates representations of majority examples with minority features to weaken shortcut influence.

Result: InterpoLL outperforms ERM and state-of-the-art methods in minority generalization across various architectures, maintaining majority accuracy.

Conclusion: InterpoLL is a broadly applicable, effective solution for shortcut mitigation, enhancing model generalization without computational or tuning burdens.

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

*Sanaz Kazemi Abharian,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GBFA, a layer-aware bit-flip fault attack targeting GNNs, showing significant accuracy degradation with minimal bit flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware-based security challenges in GNNs are overlooked, prompting investigation into fault attacks on trained weights.

Method: GBFA uses a Markov model for layer prediction and gradient ranking for bit selection, attacking specific layers.

Result: GBFA reduces GraphSAGE's accuracy by 17% on Cora with one bit flip in the last layer.

Conclusion: Layer-aware attacks like GBFA are critical for understanding GNN vulnerabilities and improving security.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

### [69] [Theoretical Learning Performance of Graph Neural Networks: The Impact of Jumping Connections and Layer-wise Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05533)
*Jiawei Sun,Hongkang Li,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the generalization guarantees of GCNs with jumping connections and graph sparsification, showing that sparsification maintains performance if essential edges are preserved, and reveals layer-specific sparsification requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in theoretical understanding of GCNs with jumping connections and graph sparsification, as existing analyses ignore one or both aspects.

Method: Theoretical analysis of learning dynamics and generalization in GCNs with jumping connections and graph sparsification, validated on benchmark datasets.

Result: Generalization accuracy approximates the highest achievable accuracy when the sparse adjacency matrix preserves essential edges. Jumping connections cause layer-specific sparsification needs.

Conclusion: Graph sparsification maintains generalization if critical edges are retained, and jumping connections influence sparsification requirements differently across layers.

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSC-GNN improves GNN performance on noisy graphs by using external clean links and penalizing discrepancies between embeddings from full and regularization graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with noisy edges, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications with imperfect data.

Method: LSC-GNN trains two encoders—one on the full graph (including external clean links) and another on a regularization graph (excluding noisy target links)—and penalizes latent representation discrepancies.

Result: LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs on benchmark datasets with moderate noise and shows promise in heterogeneous graphs like protein-metabolite networks.

Conclusion: LSC-GNN enhances predictive performance and interpretability in noisy graph settings, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

*Jingyi Gao,Sol Lim,Seokhyun Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an enhanced load estimation framework for ergonomic risk assessment, using deep learning to incorporate auxiliary gait and carrying style data without requiring manual labels at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for load estimation from gait data lack generalization and accuracy due to reliance on direct mappings. This study aims to improve accuracy by integrating auxiliary information like baseline gait and carrying style.

Method: The framework combines deep latent variable modeling, temporal convolutional networks, and bi-directional cross-attention to fuse loaded and unloaded gait patterns, eliminating the need for manual carrying style labels during deployment.

Result: Experiments with real-world inertial measurement unit data show significant accuracy improvements from auxiliary information and effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances load estimation accuracy by leveraging auxiliary data and advanced fusion techniques, offering practical benefits for ergonomic risk assessment.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multitask Preplay is a novel algorithm that uses experience from one task to simulate and learn solutions for other accessible but unpursued tasks, improving generalization and performance in multitask environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans leverage experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions for other tasks, but this ability is not well understood or replicated in artificial agents.

Method: The paper introduces Multitask Preplay, which replays experience on one task to simulate unpursued tasks, learning a predictive representation for fast adaptation.

Result: Multitask Preplay outperforms traditional methods in predicting human generalization and improves artificial agent performance in tasks like Craftax.

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory for human-like counterfactual learning, enhancing artificial agent performance in multitask environments.

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful

TL;DR: A model-free reinforcement learning approach using PPO is introduced for in situ training of diffractive optical processors, improving convergence and performance by efficiently reusing measurement data and accounting for hardware imperfections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of optimizing diffractive optical networks due to hardware imperfections and noise motivates the need for a more efficient in situ training method.

Method: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used for model-free reinforcement learning, enabling stable and faster convergence by reusing measurement data and constraining policy updates.

Result: The method demonstrated better convergence and performance in tasks like energy focusing, holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image classification.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable framework for training optical systems under real-world constraints, eliminating the need for prior system modeling.

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Motivation: Reward hacking in RL systems threatens autonomous agent deployment, but systematic detection and mitigation approaches are lacking.

Method: Analyzes 15,247 training episodes across 15 RL environments and 5 algorithms, implementing automated detection for six reward hacking categories.

Result: Detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7% recall; mitigation reduces hacking by up to 54.6%. Reward density and alignment impact hacking frequency significantly.

Conclusion: The study provides tools for RL safety, though mitigation trade-offs remain challenging due to concept drift and adversarial adaptation.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Result: Empirical validation of FACT and high performance of FACT-RFM on tabular data, capturing behaviors like grokking and phase transitions.

Conclusion: FACT provides a theoretical foundation for feature learning in neural networks, and FACT-RFM demonstrates practical applications of this theory.

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

*Netta Palez,Léonie Straß,Sebastian Meller,Holger Volk,Anna Zamansky,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using wearable inertial sensors achieved high accuracy in classifying canine gait abnormalities, aiding in distinguishing between orthopedic and neurological conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurological and orthopedic gait impairments are hard to distinguish clinically; this study aims to provide an objective diagnostic tool using inertial sensors and deep learning.

Method: Developed a deep learning model using inertial sensor data from 29 dogs, optimizing performance and generalizability for multiclass (healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and binary (healthy/non-healthy) classification.

Result: Achieved 96% accuracy in multiclass and 82% in binary classification tasks, demonstrating strong potential for clinical use.

Conclusion: Inertial-based deep learning models can serve as practical, objective tools for gait assessment in veterinary diagnostics.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for scalable, privacy-preserving AI training, addressing challenges in client-expert alignment and system load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient training of large-scale AI models on decentralized data while preserving privacy, overcoming system-level challenges in FL and MoE integration.

Method: Proposes a system design with dynamic fitness scoring, global expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling for intelligent client-expert alignment.

Result: A scalable, efficient, and robust training mechanism with fewer communication rounds for convergence.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for deploying large-scale federated MoE-structured models in edge computing with high communication efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoTriton uses RL to automate Triton kernel optimization, achieving performance comparable to large models like Claude-4-Sonnet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of Triton parameters is time-consuming and limits adoption; AutoTriton aims to automate this process.

Method: Combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with RL (GRPO algorithm) using rule-based and execution-based rewards.

Result: AutoTriton matches performance of mainstream large models and validates the importance of its modules.

Conclusion: RL-based AutoTriton shows promise for automating high-performance kernel generation, enhancing AI system efficiency.

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

TL;DR: MobileGUI-RL is a scalable framework for training GUI agents in online environments, addressing limitations of offline training by using self-exploration and GRPO adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents trained offline suffer from scalability issues, overfitting, and brittleness in unseen environments.

Method: MobileGUI-RL synthesizes tasks via self-exploration and adapts GRPO with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards.

Result: Experiments on mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent improvements, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL offers a scalable and robust solution for training GUI agents in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hongbao Li,Ziye Jia,Sijie He,Kun Guo,Qihui Wu*

TL;DR: A dual-layer UAV-assisted edge computing architecture is proposed to optimize delay and energy consumption in vehicular networks, using a hierarchical offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies lack coordination of heterogeneous resources and adaptability to dynamic network conditions in vehicular edge computing.

Method: Proposes a dual-layer architecture with high-altitude UAVs for relaying and low-altitude UAVs for computing, formulated as a Markov decision process and solved using a hierarchical offloading scheme.

Result: Simulations show the approach outperforms baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and convergence speed, with strong robustness in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture and method effectively address the challenges of UAV-assisted vehicular edge computing, offering improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

TL;DR: WeatherMixer, a multi-layer-perceptron-based model, and Jigsaw, a novel parallelization scheme, improve AI-based atmospheric forecasting by addressing memory and bandwidth bottlenecks, achieving high performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of atmospheric dynamics at high resolutions and longer lead times is hindered by memory and I/O-bandwidth limitations in large neural networks.

Method: WeatherMixer scales linearly with input size, while Jigsaw employs domain and tensor parallelism to eliminate memory redundancy.

Result: Jigsaw achieves state-of-the-art performance in scaling, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs with high efficiency.

Conclusion: The combination of WeatherMixer and Jigsaw effectively addresses computational bottlenecks, enabling scalable and efficient AI-based atmospheric forecasting.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency
versus 51% without model parallelism.

TL;DR: A deep learning and physics-informed method improves cardiac disease diagnosis by predicting biomechanical properties and classifying diseases with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac diseases are a major global health issue, requiring accurate diagnostic tools. This study aims to enhance diagnosis by combining deep learning with biomechanical modeling.

Method: The approach uses deep learning image registration with Neo-Hookean material physics to model cardiac tissue deformations. Features are extracted for disease classification using five algorithms.

Result: Achieved Dice scores up to 0.945 for cardiac structures and 98-100% classification accuracy on the ACDC dataset.

Conclusion: The method provides explainable, accurate cardiac disease diagnosis, aiding clinicians and improving patient care.

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

TL;DR: Proposes a method combining time series prediction and adapted flux balance analysis (FBA) for dynamic graph prediction, addressing limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prediction methods assume static vertices, limiting their applicability to dynamic processes like telecommunication or transport networks.

Method: Adapts flux balance analysis (FBA) for growing graphs and integrates it with time series prediction techniques.

Result: Effective performance demonstrated on synthetic (Preferential Attachment) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin).

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses vertex dynamics in graph prediction, showing promise for applications like anomaly detection.

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' capabilities in physics are underexplored, and existing benchmarks lack depth and dynamic evaluation.

Method: ABench-Physics includes static (Phy_A) and dynamic (Phy_B) problem sets with strict answer requirements.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance gaps, especially in dynamic generalization.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics offers a rigorous framework to advance LLMs' scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

*Marco Roschkowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soup-Adapter, a method for few-shot domain adaptation by averaging outputs of multiple independently trained adapters, improving performance and robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing impractical hyperparameter tuning and model robustness under distribution shifts in few-shot domain adaptation of foundation models.

Method: Training multiple independent adapters with diverse hyperparameters and averaging their outputs, reparameterizing them into a single adapter (Soup-Adapter).

Result: The ensemble model outperforms individual adapters, is more robust to distribution shifts, and less sensitive to hyperparameters like the residual ratio.

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter effectively solves the problems of hyperparameter tuning and robustness, and is the first to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond local explanations and provide a global understanding of how semantic concepts emerge and interact in neural networks, enhancing model trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic framework and interactive visualization tool (BAGEL) to analyze concept representation across layers, revealing latent circuits and information flow.

Result: Systematically quantifies concept representation, identifies spurious correlations, and provides insights into model generalization and biases.

Conclusion: The framework and BAGEL tool offer scalable, global interpretability, aiding in understanding and improving deep learning models.

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairDG, addressing domain generalization and algorithmic fairness together, proposing PAFDG for better utility-fairness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness, as current methods treat them separately, risking fairness violations in unseen domains.

Method: Derives mutual information-based bounds for risk and fairness, then introduces PAFDG, a Pareto-optimal framework for FairDG.

Result: PAFDG outperforms existing methods in balancing utility and fairness on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: FairDG is a viable approach, with PAFDG offering practical improvements in utility-fairness trade-offs.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

TL;DR: A federated learning framework is proposed to address communication overhead and statistical heterogeneity by using prototypes and lightweight adapters, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in federated learning like communication overhead and statistical heterogeneity while maintaining privacy.

Method: Uses prototypes and lightweight adapter modules to align class embeddings and reduce communication load.

Result: Improved accuracy and interpretability in classification tasks on a retinal fundus image dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces communication overhead and handles statistical heterogeneity while providing interpretability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in power system state estimation, such as speed, accuracy under faults, and vulnerability to cyber-attacks.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using PINNs, embedding physical laws into neural networks to enhance estimation accuracy and robustness.

Result: Achieves up to 83% higher accuracy on unseen data and 65% better performance on new datasets; 93% more accurate during cyber-attacks.

Conclusion: PINNs offer a promising solution for improving power system state estimation, especially under faulty or adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into
the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for
transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while
also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data
manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

TL;DR: A novel framework for task-independent embeddings of tabular data using graph structures and Graph Auto-Encoders, achieving superior performance in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular data in industrial databases lacks predefined tasks, necessitating a universal embedding method for flexible downstream applications.

Method: Transform tabular data into a graph, use Graph Auto-Encoders for entity embeddings, and aggregate them for row-level embeddings.

Result: Outperforms existing universal tabular data embedding techniques in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective, task-independent embeddings for diverse downstream tasks without retraining.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Motivation: To understand the strengths and limitations of feature-based and GAN-based methods for learning from demonstrations, focusing on reward function design and policy learning implications.

Method: Comparative analysis of feature-based (dense, interpretable rewards) and GAN-based (scalable, flexible) approaches, emphasizing structured motion representations.

Result: Feature-based methods excel in fidelity but struggle with generalization, while GAN-based methods offer flexibility but face instability. Structured motion representations improve both paradigms.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

### [95] [Diffusion Dataset Condensation: Training Your Diffusion Model Faster with Less Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05914)
*Rui Huang,Shitong Shao,Zikai Zhou,Pukun Zhao,Hangyu Guo,Tian Ye,Lichen Bai,Shuo Yang,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C), a framework to reduce the resource-intensive training of diffusion models by creating a synthetic sub-dataset with fewer samples, achieving high-quality training at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion models is resource-heavy, requiring millions of images and extensive GPU time. The study aims to address this by exploring dataset condensation for diffusion models, a novel approach compared to prior work on discriminative models.

Method: The D2C framework involves two phases: Select (identifying a compact, diverse subset using diffusion difficulty scores and interval sampling) and Attach (enhancing the subset with rich semantic and visual representations).

Result: Experiments show D2C enables significantly faster training with fewer data while maintaining high visual quality. For SiT-XL/2, it achieves a 100x speed-up and a FID score of 4.3 using only 0.8% of data.

Conclusion: D2C is an effective solution for resource-efficient diffusion model training, demonstrating substantial improvements in speed and data efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses label noise in canine auscultation data, showing that incorporating multiple expert opinions reduces noise and significantly improves classification accuracy, especially with XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in veterinary medicine hampers AI model training, particularly for canine heart murmur detection. This study aims to mitigate noise by leveraging expert consensus.

Method: A dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated by experts to reduce label noise. Three algorithms (AdaBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest) were trained and evaluated using expanded data from individual heart cycles.

Result: Label noise reduction improved all algorithms, with XGBoost showing the most gains. Sensitivity and specificity increased notably across all murmur intensity categories (mild, moderate, loud/thrilling).

Conclusion: Minimizing label noise is crucial for enhancing AI-based detection of canine heart murmurs, with XGBoost emerging as the most effective classifier.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart
sound classification, label noise reduction, machine learning, XGBoost,

*Hanyang Peng,Shuang Qin,Yue Yu,Fangqing Jiang,Hui Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets Adam as a sign-like optimizer, simplifying its convergence analysis and proving an optimal convergence rate under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretations of Adam as preconditioned SGDM require strong assumptions and complex proofs, making analysis opaque and hard to extend.

Method: Reformulate Adam as a sign-like optimizer, enabling simpler convergence analysis under mild conditions.

Result: Proves Adam achieves the optimal convergence rate of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ under weak assumptions.

Conclusion: The new interpretation simplifies theory, provides insights into momentum's role, and offers practical tuning guidelines.

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

*Julia Pelzer,Corné Verburg,Alexander Heinlein,Miriam Schulte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN) is introduced to address challenges in modeling groundwater flow with heat transport, combining lightweight numerical surrogates and CNNs for efficient and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles with limited or low-quality data in real-world applications like groundwater flow with heat transport, where classical simulations are costly and data-driven models fail in predicting advection processes.

Method: The LGCNN combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for global transport with CNNs for local groundwater velocity and heat diffusion, tested on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: The LGCNN successfully models city-wide subsurface temperature fields, scales to larger domains without retraining, and handles heterogeneous flow fields and heat plumes.

Conclusion: The LGCNN offers a computationally efficient and accurate solution for complex advection-diffusion processes, with published datasets and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

TL;DR: QAT reduces SSM complexity for edge hardware, enabling efficient deployment on AIMC chips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration of QAT's impact on SSMs for specialized edge hardware like AIMC chips.

Method: Analyze QAT's effects on SSMs, including model size, numerical precision, robustness to analog noise, and structural pruning.

Result: QAT reduces SSM complexity by up to two orders of magnitude and enhances robustness.

Conclusion: QAT enables efficient SSM deployment on AIMC chips, improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRE enables label-free self-evaluation for LRMs to detect redundant reasoning, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs exhibit overthinking (redundant reasoning), raising the need for autonomous self-evaluation without external labels.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding (CoRE) and CoRE-Eval, a training-free framework to detect cyclical fluctuations in reasoning.

Result: Reduces reasoning steps by 13.7%-33.2% and improves accuracy by ~10%, achieving 70.0% on AIME.

Conclusion: CoRE-Eval enhances reasoning efficiency and accuracy in LRMs by enabling self-evaluation of redundant steps.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

TL;DR: UARL is a safe RL framework that avoids direct target domain interaction, using uncertainty-aware training in simulations for robust real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing safety and practicality issues in RL deployment, such as distribution shifts and unsafe direct interactions.

Method: Uses ensemble critics for uncertainty quantification and progressive environmental randomization in simulations.

Result: Effective OOD detection, improved performance, and sample efficiency in MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot.

Conclusion: UARL safely enhances RL robustness without target domain training, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

*Dongyoon Kim,Sungjae Lee,Wonjin Lee,Kwang In Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO-SAH is a zeroth-order optimization method using subspace-based Hessian estimation for faster convergence with reduced function-query costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient information is often inaccessible, and existing zeroth-order methods lack efficient curvature (second-order) information, limiting convergence speed.

Method: ZO-SAH estimates Hessian in randomly selected 2D subspaces by fitting quadratic polynomials and reuses function evaluations via periodic subspace-switching.

Result: ZO-SAH outperforms existing zeroth-order methods, achieving faster convergence on tasks like logistic regression and deep neural network training.

Conclusion: ZO-SAH effectively balances Hessian estimation cost and convergence speed, making it a practical zeroth-order optimization solution.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

TL;DR: An AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework using matrix factorization techniques (HNMFk, BNMFk, LMF) to infer hidden associations in scientific literature networks, validated by predicting missing links in a TMD-focused corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature networks are large, sparse, and noisy, often missing links between entities. The goal is to uncover hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk), Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk), and Logistic matrix factorization (LMF) to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus on TMDs. Uses an ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach for interpretability and probabilistic scoring.

Result: Clusters materials into coherent topics (e.g., superconductivity, energy storage) and predicts missing links, validated by successfully identifying associations with superconducting TMD clusters.

Conclusion: The method effectively uncovers hidden connections in scientific literature, aiding cross-disciplinary exploration, and is supported by an interactive dashboard for human-in-the-loop discovery.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, proposes frame-theoretic methods to characterize Parseval stability, and derives efficient optimization objectives to suppress aliasing. It also provides insights into aliasing behavior at initialization for random kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aliasing in convolutional layers affects numerical stability and generalization. Existing methods lack a general analysis of aliasing and its stability implications, especially for short kernel sizes.

Method: A frame-theoretic approach is adapted to analyze aliasing in 1D convolutional layers, leading to stability bounds and Parseval stability characterizations. Two efficient optimization objectives are derived to suppress aliasing.

Result: Practical stability bounds are provided, and closed-form expressions for aliasing effects in random kernels reveal initialization behavior.

Conclusion: The work offers a systematic way to address aliasing in convolutional layers, ensuring Parseval stability and providing insights for initialization.

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method optimizes connections in Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) by selecting high-merit connections and gate-types, outperforming fixed-connection LGNs with fewer gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance of LGNs by optimizing connections and reducing the number of gates required.

Method: Uses a probability distribution to select high-merit connections per gate input, followed by gate-type selection.

Result: Connection-optimized LGNs outperform fixed-connection LGNs on benchmarks (Yin-Yang, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) with fewer gates (e.g., 8000 gates for 98% MNIST accuracy).

Conclusion: The method advances trainable Boolean logic by demonstrating superior performance with significantly fewer logic gates.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a
probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting
the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting differential design techniques from Transformers to Mamba, a selective state-space model, to address attention overallocation issues. A novel differential mechanism for Mamba is introduced, improving retrieval and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to irrelevant context, degrading capabilities such as long-range retrieval and robustness. The goal is to mitigate this in Mamba.

Method: The study adapts differential design to Mamba, requiring architectural modifications. A novel differential mechanism is introduced and validated on language modeling benchmarks.

Result: The proposed approach improves retrieval capabilities and outperforms vanilla Mamba. Ablation studies justify design choices and confirm mitigation of attention overallocation.

Conclusion: The novel differential mechanism effectively addresses attention overallocation in Mamba-based models, enhancing performance and retrieval abilities.

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for flexible, energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies in evolving wireless communication systems drives the study of pinching antennas (PAs).

Method: The problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. Neural networks of varying complexity are used to learn activation policies from data, incorporating spatial features and signal structure, and accounting for user location uncertainty.

Result: Simulations show the proposed models are effective and robust in optimizing PA activation.

Conclusion: Neural network-based approaches efficiently solve the complex PA activation problem, demonstrating promise for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

### [115] [From General Relation Patterns to Task-Specific Decision-Making in Continual Multi-Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06004)
*Chang Yao,Youfang Lin,Shoucheng Song,Hao Wu,Yuqing Ma,Shang Han,Kai Lv*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPG, a method for Co-MARL that uses relation patterns to prevent catastrophic forgetting and enable zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in Co-MARL while learning new coordination policies with dynamic teams.

Method: Proposes RPG, which extracts task-agnostic relation patterns and maps them to task-specific action spaces using a conditional hypernetwork, with regularization to prevent forgetting.

Result: RPG prevents catastrophic forgetting and achieves zero-shot generalization on SMAC and LBF benchmarks.

Conclusion: RPG effectively balances generality and task-specificity in Co-MARL, mitigating forgetting and enabling generalization.

Abstract: Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Co-MARL) requires agents to
address catastrophic forgetting issues while learning new coordination policies
with the dynamics team. In this paper, we delve into the core of Co-MARL,
namely Relation Patterns, which refer to agents' general understanding of
interactions. In addition to generality, relation patterns exhibit
task-specificity when mapped to different action spaces. To this end, we
propose a novel method called General Relation Patterns-Guided Task-Specific
Decision-Maker (RPG). In RPG, agents extract relation patterns from dynamic
observation spaces using a relation capturer. These task-agnostic relation
patterns are then mapped to different action spaces via a task-specific
decision-maker generated by a conditional hypernetwork. To combat forgetting,
we further introduce regularization items on both the relation capturer and the
conditional hypernetwork. Results on SMAC and LBF demonstrate that RPG
effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks and
achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.
